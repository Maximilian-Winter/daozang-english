  "full_translation": "**Laozi Textual Collation and Annotation by Zhu Qianzhi**\n\n**Preface to the Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxingguan Stele Edition of the *Daodejing***\n\nQian Daxin remarked: According to the commentary of Heshang Gong, the text beginning with \"The Dao that can be spoken\" constitutes the *Dao Jing* (Book of the Way), Volume One, while the text beginning with \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous\" constitutes the *De Jing* (Book of Virtue/Power), Volume Two. Chao Yuezhi’s postscript to Wang Bi’s commentary states that Wang did not divide the text into *Dao* and *De* sections, thus preserving an ancient convention. However, Lu Deming’s *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations* (*Jingdian Shiwen*) explicitly follows Fu Si’s (Wang Bi’s) edition, titling it \"Dao Jing, Volume One\" and \"De Jing, Volume Two,\" identical to Heshang Gong’s arrangement. Chao’s claim of antiquity likely stems from a Song dynasty transcription, lacking proper verification.\n\nAmong the five stele editions of the *Daodejing* in my collection, only the Emperor Minghuang’s imperial commentary and this edition divide the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*, a structure consistent with Han and Wei dynasty editions. This stele, carved in the early Tang, contains numerous variant characters distinct from other versions. For instance:\n- \"無\" (wú) is written as \"无\" (wú),\n- \"愈\" (yù) as \"俞\" (yú),\n- \"芸\" (yún) as \"云\" (yún),\n- \"譽\" (yù) as \"豫\" (yù),\n- \"荒\" (huāng) as \"忙\" (máng),\n- \"佐\" (zuǒ) as \"作\" (zuò),\n- \"\" (xī) as \"翕\" (xī),\n\nall adhering to ancient script forms.\n\nFurther examples include:\n- Where other editions read \"故能蔽不新成\" (*hence it can obscure and not renew*), the stele reads \"能蔽復成\" (*can obscure and renew*).\n- After \"Where the army has camped, brambles grow,\" the stele omits the lines \"After a great war, there must be famine years.\"\n- After \"The supreme general stands on the right,\" the stele omits \"This is to position him according to funeral rites.\"\n- The passage \"Only by recognizing illness as illness does one avoid illness; the sage is not ill because he recognizes illness as illness, thus avoiding illness\" appears on the stele simply as: \"Thus the sage is not ill, for he recognizes illness as illness, and so avoids illness.\"\n\nSuch variants far surpass other editions. These few examples suffice to demonstrate the value of ancient steles.\n\nWu Yi stated: The division of the *Laozi* into *Dao Jing* (Volume One) and *De Jing* (Volume Two) aligns with ancient editions. Later, Lu You (Fangweng) noted in his postscript: \"Chao claimed that Wang Bi’s *Laozi* did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower sections, preserving an ancient form. Yet this edition has long since been divided.\" Thus, even by the Song dynasty, Wang Bi’s definitive edition was already lost.\n\nThe *Lunyu Shu* (Commentary on the *Analects*) by Xing Bing cites the *De Jing*: \"The net of heaven is vast; though its mesh is wide, nothing escapes.\" This serves as one piece of evidence.\n\nExamining the *Hanshu* (Book of Han) annotations:\n- Yan Shigu, in the *Biography of Wei Bao*, quotes the *Dao Jing*: \"In a state of chaos and confusion, loyal ministers emerge.\"\n- In the *Biography of Tian Heng*, he cites the *De Jing*: \"Nobility takes humility as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation. Thus lords and kings call themselves 'orphaned,' 'widowed,' and 'destitute.'\"\n- In the *Biography of Emperor Yuan of Chu*, he quotes the *De Jing*: \"Knowing contentment avoids disgrace.\"\n- In the *Biography of Yan Zhu*, he notes: \"This is what Laozi meant by 'Where the army camps, brambles grow.'\" Yan Shigu comments: \"This is from the *Dao Jing*.\"\n- In the *Biography of Yang Xiong*, \"Those who value me are few,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"The *De Jing* states, 'Those who know me are few; thus I am valued.'\"\n- In the *Biographies of Harsh Officials*, Laozi’s words are cited: \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous, thus it possesses virtue; lesser virtue does not lose virtue, thus it lacks virtue. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\" Yan Shigu comments: \"This is from the *De Jing*.\"\n- \"When inferior scholars hear the Dao, they laugh greatly,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"This is from the *Dao Jing*.\"\n- In the *Treatise on the Western Regions*, the annotation quotes the *De Jing*: \"When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.\"\n\nAll these citations divide the text into *Dao* and *De* sections, aligning with Lu Deming’s *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations*, which titles them \"Dao Jing Pronunciation and Meaning\" and \"De Jing Pronunciation and Meaning.\" Jia Gongyan’s commentary on the *Zhouli* (*Rites of Zhou*) also cites the *Dao Jing*: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao,\" and subsequently references the *De Jing*: \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous, thus it possesses virtue.\" Zhanghuai Taizi’s commentary on the *Hou Hanshu* (*Book of Later Han*), in the *Biography of Zhai Pu*, quotes the *Dao Jing*: \"Fish cannot be removed from the spring.\"\n\nThese scholars, writing in the early Tang, uniformly attest to this division. The *Mengzhen Ke Stele* states: \"Examining the *Dao Jing*, compassion is its treasure.\" Such evidence must derive from Jin and Song dynasty editions, confirming the division in this stele as historically grounded.\n\nWang Chang remarked: The stele’s upper volume is titled *Laozi Dao Jing* and the lower *Laozi De Jing*, clearly separating *Dao* and *De* without conflation. Thus, Emperor Xuanzong’s commentary follows this ancient structure. Dong Qian’s *Catalogue of Collected Books* erroneously claims that Xuanzong’s commentary first reorganized the text into the *Daodejing*, grouping *Dao*-related passages in the upper volume and *De*-related passages in the lower. This is incorrect.\n\nWu Yun stated: The *Sui Shu Jingji Zhi* (*Bibliographic Treatise of the Sui History*) records the *Daodejing* in two volumes with Wang Bi’s commentary. Chao Yuezhi and Xiong Kezhong’s postscripts both assert that the text was not divided into *Dao* and *De* sections, yet the current *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations* clearly separates it into two volumes. Some suspect this division was added by later editors. However, Xing Bing’s *Lunyu Shu* cites the *De Jing* (\"The net of heaven is vast...\"), and Yan Shigu’s *Hanshu* annotations frequently reference the *Dao Jing* and *De Jing* as distinct. Thus, the division did not originate with Lu Deming. This stele’s inscription of the *De Jing* is well-founded.\n\nSun Yirang noted: The *Laozi*’s eighty-one chapters are divided into *Dao Jing* (upper) and *De Jing* (lower).\n\nThe *Heshang Gong* version, the Wang Bi annotated edition recorded in the *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations*, the Tang-era Fu Yi collated edition in the *Daoist Canon*, and the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s annotated stele edition all align in this regard. The *Hongming Ji*’s *Mouzi’s Treatise on Resolving Doubts* states: “The principles are rectified in thirty-seven clauses, which also incorporate the thirty-seven chapters of the *Dao Jing* from the teachings of Laozi.” Thus, as early as the Han dynasty, this text was already divided into the *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*, with the *Dao Jing* comprising thirty-seven chapters and the *De Jing* forty-four—matching precisely the modern edition. The extant Wang Bi commentary, derived from the Song-era collation by Chao Yuezhi, does not separate the *Dao* and *De* sections. While this may be coherent in meaning, it does not reflect the original form of the Han and Tang texts.\n\n**Chapter One**\nHong Yixuan remarked: The Wang Fusi (Wang Bi) edition of the *Daodejing* in circulation today uniformly includes chapter divisions. Though this edition does not record the total number of chapters, each chapter is demarcated by an empty space. Some divisions differ from the modern Wang Bi edition: for instance, in the current version, “The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible” through “it is the predecessor of the Emperor” forms three chapters; “Heaven and earth are not humane” through “it is better to abide in the center” forms four; and “The valley spirit never dies” through “its use is never exhausted” forms six—whereas this edition combines them into one. The lines “Thus, being is the benefit, non-being is the use” are attached to Chapter Twelve in the modern Wang edition, but here, the word “thus” is omitted, and the two lines are placed at the beginning of the following chapter. The lines “Heaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness” appear in Chapter Twenty-Six in the modern edition but are appended to the end of the preceding chapter here. Lu Deming’s *Pronunciations and Meanings of the Laozi* has already been altered by later hands in its chapter divisions, and it is regrettable that this edition cannot be compared against it.\n\n**The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;**\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal name.**\n\nYu Zhengxie observed: In these two lines by Laozi, the terms “Dao” and “name” differ from their usage elsewhere. Here, “Dao” refers to speech, and “name” to writing. The *Wenzi*’s *Essence and Sincerity* states: “The name that can be named is not the eternal name; inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved in metal and stone, these are but its coarse manifestations.” The *Superior Righteousness* chapter says: “Reciting the books of the former kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping their meaning. Thus, the name that can be named is not the eternal name.” The *Superior Ritual* chapter states: “The laws and measures of the former kings undergo change, hence ‘the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’” The *Huainanzi*’s *Original Dao* chapter declares: “The perfected person seals their mouth and silences their discourse, yet none in the world recognize the value of their silence. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.”\n\nInscribed on bamboo and silk, carved in metal and stone—what can be transmitted to others is but its coarse form. Scholars of later ages, though learned and widely informed, are not immune to confusion.\n\nThe *Miu Cheng Xun* states: “That the Dao has chapters and defined forms is not its ultimate expression.” The *Dao Ying Xun* records: “Duke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Bian said, ‘What remains is but the dregs.’ Thus Laozi says: ‘The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’” All these take Laozi’s “Dao” as discourse and “name” as written words.\n\nYan Zhi notes: Yu’s interpretation is correct. Laozi composed his five thousand characters precisely to set forth the intent behind his words. For “Dao” is the general term for transformation. It shifts with the times, responding to things with change; though mutable, there is that within it which does not change—this is what is called “constant.”\n\nFrom early commentators on Laozi onward, many have held that the Dao cannot be spoken. Gao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*’s *Fan Lun Xun* says: “The eternal Dao is deep, hidden, and obscure—it cannot be spoken.” The spurious *Guan Yinzi* expands this, claiming that “what cannot be spoken is the Dao.” In truth, Laozi’s book itself declares that “nothing is the function of the Dao, while something is its benefit”—it is not that the Dao cannot be spoken. He speaks of “beautiful words,” of “words having a ruler,” of “correct words seeming contradictory,” of “my words being very easy to know and very easy to practice”—all these are spoken, all can be expressed and named.\n\nYet commentators, fixating on one aspect, take “constant” to mean unchanging and immutable. What can be spoken and named is subject to change, while what cannot be spoken or named is beyond change (Lin Xiyi). Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is deemed unspeakable, and the name that can be named is deemed unnameable. They fail to grasp that Laozi’s Dao is ceaselessly shifting, flowing through the six directions—there is no eternally unchanging Dao, nor any eternally unchanging name. Therefore, in engaging the world, one has no fixed mind, “taking the hearts of the common people as one’s heart” (Chapter 49). In responding to things, one “establishes them in constant non-being” (*Zhuangzi*, “Under Heaven”), for words can be constantly non-existent or constantly existent, not clinging to old constancy. Not clinging to old constancy, it is called “not constant.” Yet in constant being and constant non-being, it is said: “Returning to the root is called constancy” (Chapter 16), “Knowing harmony is called constancy” (Chapter 55)—the constant is the inconstant.\n\nDay gives way to night, death to life; resting in the proper time and following the natural course, one moves with the times. As Zhuangzi says: “Life and death are fate, like the constant alternation of night and day—this is Heaven.” The Dao of Heaven and Earth endures without cease; the four seasons transform yet achieve lasting completion. If it were unchanging and immutable, how could there be anything called “constant”? Thus it is said: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.”\n\n“No-name” is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; “name” is the mother of the myriad things. Yan Kejun notes: “‘No-name’—most versions write ‘無’; the following instances follow this pattern. ‘The beginning of Heaven and Earth’—the *Yu Zhu* commentary matches this. The *He Shang Gong* and Wang Bi versions write ‘the beginning of Heaven and Earth,’ and the following line also includes the word ‘之.’” Wei Jiasun says: Yan’s collation note states: “Most versions write ‘無’; the following instances follow this pattern.” For the line “act without acting,” the collation note is the same. This edition of the *Dao De Jing* consistently writes “無” in the *Dao Jing*; in the *De Jing*, it writes “無” before “act without acting” and “無” thereafter. This line should read: “The *Dao Jing* follows this pattern.” Luo Zhenyu says: The Jinglong and Dunhuang versions write “無” throughout, as does the *Yu Zhu* stone edition. The two “之” characters are absent in the Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, and Dunhuang versions but present in the *He Shang Gong* version.\n\nYan Zhi notes: The *Jing Dian Shi Wen*, Volume 2, *Zhou Yi Yin Yi*, states: “‘無’ is pronounced *wu*; this character appears throughout the *Yi*. The *Shuo Wen* says: ‘An archaic character for *wu*, connected to *yuan*, signifying the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. Wang Yu explains that Heaven curves to the northwest, forming *wu*.’ The vulgar form is ‘旡,’ which is incorrect. ‘旡’ is pronounced *ji* and appears in characters like ‘既.’ Laozi writes ‘無,’ consistent with the *Yi*.” Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan’s versions all include the word “之.” Fan’s version writes “萬” as “万.” “No-name is the beginning of Heaven and Earth”—the *Shiji*, *Biographies of Diviners*, quotes it as “No-name is the beginning of the myriad things.” Wang Bi’s commentary states: “All things begin from nothing, so before form and name exist, it is the beginning of the myriad things.” This seems to treat both lines as referring to “myriad things,” which is incorrect.\n\nNote that “beginning” (*shi*) and “mother” (*mu*) have distinct meanings. The *Shuo Wen* says: “‘Beginning’ (*shi*) is the first stage of a woman.” “Mother” (*mu*) depicts a child in the womb—one interpretation is that it shows a child nursing. This distinction between the two states of named and nameless carries profound significance. Before Heaven and Earth arose, all was undifferentiated chaos, like a maiden’s first innocence, pure and unadorned. Chapter 25 of the text says: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth.” Chapter 40 states: “Being arises from non-being.” This is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth. “The myriad things of the world are born from being”—being engenders ceaseless generation. Chapter 42 says: “The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to the myriad things.”\n\nThis is the named mother of the myriad things. The *Zhuangzi*’s “On the Equality of Things” also states: “Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one”—both instances juxtapose the terms “Heaven and Earth” and “the myriad things.” “Ever without, to observe its mystery; ever with, to observe its boundary.”\n\nFan Yingyuan says: The ancient editions, along with those of Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Li Ruoyu, and Zhang Junxiang, all include the word *gu* (故, “thus”) before “ever without.” He further cites the *Yinbian* (音辩), which states: “‘Ever without’ and ‘ever with’ should be read as a single phrase.” Wang Yinglin says: The practice of punctuating after “with” (*you*, 有) and “without” (*wu*, 無) in the first chapter began with Wang Jiefu. Yan Kejun says: The imperial commentary follows this same punctuation. In the editions of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi, the word *yi* (以, “by”) appears before “observe” in both clauses, but Luo Zhenyu notes that the three Dunhuang manuscripts all omit *gu* and the two instances of *yi*. Additionally, “boundary” (*jiao*, 徼) is written as *jiao* (皦) in the Dunhuang texts. Yu Yue says: The *Daodejing* stele engraved in the second year of Jinglong (708 CE) in Yizhou lacks both instances of *yi*, and this should be followed. Sima Wengong and Wang Jinggong both punctuate after “without,” which is also correct. Yi Shunding says: The *Zhuangzi*’s “Tianxia” chapter states: “Laozi heard of its teachings and delighted in them, establishing them upon ‘ever without and with’ (*chang wu you*, 常無有).” Here, “ever without” and “ever with” are treated as a single phrase, just as in this chapter—this usage already appears in the *Zhuangzi*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The imperial commentary, along with the editions of Xing Xuan, Jingfu, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Gu Huan, Peng Si, and Gao Di, all omit *gu*. For “boundary” (*jiao*), the editions of Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan agree with the stele, but the Dunhuang version’s *jiao* (皦) should be adopted. In Chapter 14, “its upper part is not *jiao* (皦),” the Jinglong stele also writes it as *jiao*, which is correct. The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (一切經音義), Volume 84, cites the *Shuowen*: “‘*Jiao* (徼)’ is written as ‘to patrol’ (*xun*), meaning to intercept.” Here, the sense of interception is irrelevant. Volumes 79 and 83 of the same work cite the *Shuowen*: “‘*Jiao* (皦)’ is composed of *ri* (日, sun) and its phonetic, though the two Xu editions omit it.” Tian Qian says: According to Hui Lin’s citation of the *Pipang* (埤倉), “it means ‘bright’ (*ming*),” and the *Yunhui* (韻會) also defines it as “bright,” though without specifying the source. The *Book of Songs* says, “as bright as the *jiao* sun,” and the *Shi Zhuan* (詩傳) explains: “*Jiao* means ‘radiant’ (*guang*).” The ancient edition of the *Shuowen* originally included the character *jiao*, but later generations sometimes borrowed *jiao* (皎) in its place. *Jiao* (皎) refers to the whiteness of the moon, as in the *Book of Songs* line, “the moon emerges, *jiao* bright.” Alternatively, they borrowed *jiao* (皦), which denotes the whiteness of white jade, as in the *Analects*’ “*jiao* as if.” Each character has its own semantic domain. In “as bright as the *jiao* sun,” *jiao* (皦) is firmly associated with *ri* (日, sun), not *bai* (白, white).\n\nThe text reads: “Ever without, observe its mystery.” “Mystery” (*miao*) refers to the subtle and minute, as Xun Yue’s *Shenjian* says: “What is profoundly subtle is called *miao*.” “Ever with, observe its *jiao* (皦)”—“*jiao*” here means “radiance” (*guangming*), forming a parallel with “mystery.” The implication is that what is manifest in principle is called *jiao*. These two emerge from the same source but have different names.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Chen Jingyuan’s *Cangshi Zuanwei* punctuates after “these two are the same” (*ci liang zhe tong*). Yan Fu says: The pause should come after “same,” for all things derive from the same. However, “emerge from the same” (*tong chu*) and “have different names” (*yi ming*) form a parallel structure, so punctuating after “same” is incorrect. Jiang Xichang says: The twelve characters following “these two are the same” are absent in Fan Yingyuan’s edition. Qian Zhi notes: The *Xugu Yizong Shu* edition of Fan’s text includes these twelve characters; Jiang’s emendation is mistaken. Chapter 40 states: “The myriad things of the world are born from being, and being arises from non-being.” Here, “these two” refer to being and non-being. Being and non-being have different names, yet the Dao unites them as one. “Both are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound—gateway to all mysteries.”\n\nZhang Heng says: “The profound (*xuan*) is the formless kind, the root of spontaneity. It acts at the Great Beginning, and nothing precedes it. It embraces virtue and power, enveloping Heaven and Earth, containing and regulating primordial *qi*, bestowing without form.” Yang Xiong says: “The profound is what is dark and vast, pervading the myriad kinds without manifesting form.” Both interpretations derive from this passage.\n\n**Phonology**\nLi Daochun says: “The phrasing of this text often harmonizes in rhyme.” Deng Tingzhen says: “Many works among the Masters employ rhymed prose, but none so densely as the *Laozi*. Apart from the *Book of Changes* and the *Book of Songs*, it is the most ancient.” Liu Shipei says: “To study the divisions of ancient rhyme, one must examine rhymed texts from the Zhou dynasty. Among Zhou works, aside from the *Book of Changes* and the *Li Sao*, none are as purely rhymed as the *Laozi*.” Today, we take Jiang Yougao’s *Laozi Yun Du* as the primary reference, supplemented by Wu Yu’s *Yun Bu*, Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, Jiang Yong’s *Guyun Biaozhun*, Yao Wentian’s *Guyin Xie*, Deng Tingzhen’s *Shuangyanzhai Biji* (Volume 3), and Li Gengyun’s *Bingzhu Bian*, to trace the ancient rhymes of the text, seeking patterns in its phrases and characters.\n\nMoreover, Liu Shipei, Xi Dong, Chen Zhu, and Bernhard Karlgren’s *A Study of Rhymes in the Laozi* (*The Poetical Parts in Lao-Tsi*) present many conjectural theories on the ancient phonology of the *Laozi*, some of which are tenable. I have occasionally appended my own views, and thus it becomes evident that the five thousand characters of the text largely conform to phonetic harmony, forming a resplendent composition. Once the principles of rhyme are clarified, the beauty of its philosophical poetry becomes apparent.\n\nBelow, I shall examine the text chapter by chapter. For this chapter, Jiang Yougao’s *Laozi Yun Du* identifies the following rhymes:\n*Dao* (道) rhymes with *Dao* (道) in the *you* group;\n*ming* (名) rhymes with *ming* (名) in the *geng* group;\n*shi* (始) rhymes with *mu* (母) in the *zhi* group (*mu* read as *mǎnyǐ* in fanqie);\n*miao* (妙) rhymes with *jiao* (徼) in the *xiao* group (*jiao* in the departing tone);\n*xuan* (玄) rhymes with *men* (门) in a mixed *wen-zhen* rhyme (*xuan* read as *hújūn* in fanqie).\n\nQian Zhi’s note: *Xuan* (玄) belongs to the *zhen* group, while *men* (门) belongs to the *wen* group; the *wen* and *zhen* groups share rhymes.\nYao Wentian concurs, except for *xuan* and *men*.\nKarlgren, however, argues that *tong* (同) and *ming* (名) form a rhyme, which is incorrect.\nDeng Tingzhen also errs in claiming that *Dao* (道) and *Dao* (道), as well as *ming* (名) and *ming* (名), do not rhyme.\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version of this chapter contains fifty-four characters, matching the Dunhuang manuscript. The *Heshang Gong* version (Song dynasty edition), Wang Bi’s version (from the *Guyi Congshu*), Fu Yi’s version (from the *Jingxun Tang*), and Fan Yingyuan’s version (from the *Xugu Guyishu*) all contain fifty-nine characters. Yan Kejun observes: “A single character’s space follows the phrase *zhong miao zhi men* (众妙之门) to mark the division of chapters, though the imperial commentary does not include this space. The *Heshang Gong* version titles the preceding section *‘Tidao Di Yi’* (体道第一), while Wang Bi titles it *‘Chapter One.’* This version lacks such headings, and subsequent chapters follow this convention.” My own note: The *Laozi* originally comprised two scrolls, upper and lower; later generations divided it into chapters, resulting in variations of fifty-five, sixty-four, sixty-eight, seventy-two, or eighty-one chapters. Though the stele version does not record the number of chapters, each is separated by a blank space, aligning roughly with the divisions in the *Heshang Gong*, Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan versions. Thus, I adopt the chapter divisions as transmitted in these received texts. This chapter is titled *‘Dao Ke Dao Zhang Di Yi’* (道可道章第一) in Fan Yingyuan’s version. Chapter Two follows.\n\nAll under heaven know beauty as beauty—this is already ugliness;\nAll know goodness as goodness—this is already not goodness.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* quotes the latter line as “All under heaven know goodness as goodness—this is already not goodness.” Peng Song observes: “The *Dazhen* and *Qingyuan* editions both include ‘under heaven’ before ‘all know goodness as goodness.’” Fan Yingyuan’s edition concurs, with Fan’s commentary noting: “Ancient edition.” The *Lunyu Jijie Yishu* (9) quotes “all know” as “take to know.” The *Guangming* and Zhao Mengfu editions render the final “已” as “矣,” while Li Daochun’s edition changes the first “已” to “矣.” Su Zhe’s and Dong Sijing’s editions replace both “已” with “矣.” “已” and “矣” were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Shuowen* (5) states: “矣 is a word marking completion, composed of 矢 and its phonetic.” The character was also written as “已.”]\n\nThus:\nBeing and non-being give birth to one another;\nDifficulty and ease complete one another;\nLong and short shape one another;\nHigh and low incline toward one another;\nTones and voices harmonize with one another;\nBefore and after follow one another.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The Dunhuang manuscript, Suizhou stele, and Gu Huan’s edition omit the word “thus.” In the six instances of “相,” the *Guangming*, *Jingfu*, *Qingyang*, *Panxi*, *Louzheng*, *Shitang*, Peng Song’s, Fu Yi’s, Fan Yingyuan’s, Gao Pi’s, and Zhao Mengfu’s editions, along with the *Hou Hanshu*’s commentary on Zhu Mu’s biography, all include the particle “之,” whereas Wang Bi’s and Heshang Gong’s editions omit it. Li Daochun remarks: “Adding ‘之’ to the six phrases from ‘Being and non-being give birth to one another’ onward is incorrect.” Yan Kejun notes: “‘Shape one another’—Wang Bi renders this as ‘compare one another,’ as recorded in the *Shiwen*.” Ma Xulun’s note: The reading “shape one another” is correct. Bi Yuan states: “Wang Bi’s ‘compare’ and Lu Deming’s ‘compare’ are both incorrect. The character ‘较’ did not exist in antiquity; the original text rhymes ‘shape’ with ‘incline,’ so ‘compare’ is clearly unsuitable.” Liu Shipei argues: “The *Wenzi* reads: ‘Long and short do not shape one another.’ The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* states: ‘Short and long shape one another.’ It is likely that Laozi’s original text also used ‘shape,’ rhyming with ‘birth,’ ‘complete,’ and ‘incline.’ ‘Compare’ was a later gloss, explaining ‘shape’; scribes then replaced ‘shape’ with ‘compare.’” Note: The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* reads: “Thus high and low incline toward one another, short and long shape one another,” including two instances of “也.” “Long” was altered to “修” to avoid the taboo of the father’s name. Ma Xulun states: “‘Compare’—all editions render this as ‘shape.’ The *Shuowen* records the ancient form of ‘荆’ as ‘○,’ so the ancient form of ‘形’ may also have been written with ‘○.’ The ‘爻’ component in ‘爻’ resembles the ‘爻’ in the ‘○’ form. Perhaps Laozi originally wrote ‘○,’ which was corrupted in transmission to ‘爻’; readers, finding it unintelligible, added the ‘车’ component to form ‘○.’ Later, ‘较’ became standard while ‘○’ fell out of use, resulting in the character ‘较.’”]\n\nTones and voices harmonize with one another;\nBefore and after follow one another.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: “Before”—the Dunhuang manuscript renders this as “先,” as do the Suizhou stele, Gu Huan’s, and Qiang Siqi’s editions. Jiang Xichang observes: “Gu Huan’s commentary in the *Cheng* edition reads ‘what comes first and what comes after,’ indicating that ‘before’ was originally ‘先.’ Qiang Siqi’s commentary states: ‘The later is seen through the earlier; the earlier is illuminated by the later.’ This also uses ‘先.’ Laozi’s text consistently pairs ‘先’ and ‘后,’ so this instance should not differ. Examples include Chapter 7: ‘Thus the sage places himself last and finds himself first’; Chapter 66: ‘To lead the people, one must place oneself behind them’; and Chapter 67: ‘Abandoning the last to grasp the first.’”]\n\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The Suizhou stele includes the character “治” after “人,” as does the Dunhuang manuscript. Cheng Xuanying’s commentary states: “Thus it is said, ‘Therefore the sage governs.’” The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (34) omits “治.”]\n\nThe myriad things arise yet do not decline;\n[Bi Yuan notes: Heshang Gong and Wang Bi both read: “The myriad things arise therein yet do not decline.” Lu Xisheng and the *Taiping Yulan* omit the word “therein.” Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, imperial commentary, and Jingfu editions all omit “therein.” Ma Xulun’s note: The Suizhou stele and Fu Yi’s edition also omit “therein.” Furthermore, “do not decline” is rendered as “do not initiate” in the Suizhou stele, Dunhuang manuscript, Fu Yi’s, and Fan Yingyuan’s editions. Fan Yingyuan states: “Wang Bi and Yang Fu follow the ancient edition.” Thus, Fan’s Wang Bi edition also reads “do not initiate.” Yi Shunding argues: The commentary in Wang Bi’s Chapter 17, which reads: “The great man, being above, dwells in non-action and practices the teaching without words; the myriad things arise therein yet do not initiate,” fully quotes this chapter’s text, proving that Wang Bi’s edition read “do not initiate,” though it included an additional “therein” compared to Fu Yi’s edition. Ma Xulun’s note: The reading “do not initiate” is correct and should be adopted as the standard. Bi Yuan states: “‘Initiate’ and ‘decline’ share the same sound, leading to this variation; Fu Yi’s interpretation is superior.” Lao Jian remarks: “The *Shuowen* records the seal script of ‘○’ as ‘,’ derived from 台. The *Xia Song Guwen Sisheng Yun* cites the stone classics’ ‘词’ as ‘○,’ and the ancient *Xiaojing*’s ‘始’ as ‘○.’ The ancient forms of these two characters were originally similar.”]\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, examining the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Valuing Impartiality” chapter, it states: “Heaven and Earth are vast indeed; they give life yet do not treat as their children, bring to completion yet do not possess. The myriad things all receive their benefit yet none know whence it begins.” The “Examining Distinctions” chapter further says: “Perfect in relation to the myriad things yet not controlling them, bestowing blessings upon the world yet none know whence it originates.” These passages both derive from this chapter of the *Laozi*, and the interpretation of “beginning” (*shi*) is superior.\n\n“Giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying”—\nLuo Zhenyu notes: “‘Giving life yet not possessing’ is absent in the Dunhuang manuscript.”\nMa Xulun observes: The Suizhou stele edition also omits this line. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (Volume 34) cites the same as this stone inscription.\n\n“Success is not dwelled upon.”\n“Only by not dwelling does it not depart.”\n\nYan Kejun states: The imperial commentary and Wang Bi’s edition read “success achieved and not dwelled upon,” while Heshang Gong’s version has “success achieved yet not dwelled upon.”\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jingfu edition reads “success achieved and not dwelled upon,” while the Dunhuang manuscript has “success achieved and not abiding.” Furthermore, “only by not dwelling,” in the Jinglong and imperial commentaries, “not” (*bu*) replaces “not” (*fu*), while the Dunhuang manuscript reads “not abiding.”\nMa Shulun remarks: Wang Bi’s commentary states, “Following things in their use, success arises from them, hence it is not dwelled upon.” Thus, Wang originally wrote “not dwelled upon.” The current “not” (*bu*) rendered as “not” (*fu*) may have been altered by later hands following Heshang Gong’s version.\nJiang Xichang observes: The *Huainanzi*’s “Responding to the Dao” chapter and the *Book of Later Han*’s annotation to the biography of Zhu Jun both cite “not” (*fu*) as “not” (*bu*). The *Yi Jing*’s *Xici* commentary’s *Zhengyi* quotes “yet not dwelled upon” as “not dwelled upon.” Qiang Ben’s *Yan* commentary reads: “Only by not daring to rest in dwelling,” where Yan’s “not” (*fu*) is “not” (*bu*). Qiang Ben’s citation of Cheng Xuanying’s subcommentary on the sutra text reads “success achieved and not abiding,” indicating Cheng wrote “success achieved and not abiding.” Ancient editions uniformly render “not” (*fu*) as “not” (*bu*). In Chapter 24, “Thus the person of the Dao does not abide”; in Chapter 38, “Not dwelling in its meagerness, not dwelling in its splendor”; and in Chapter 77, “Success achieved yet not abiding”—“not dwelling” (*bu ju*) or “not abiding” (*bu chu*) may be used interchangeably, as “dwelling” (*ju*) and “abiding” (*chu*) are largely synonymous. However, “not” (*fu*) is consistently rendered as “not” (*bu*). Comparing editions of the *Laozi* confirms that the original text was thus.\n\nThe *Lunheng*’s “Naturalness” chapter states: “Thus the greatness of non-action is evident. Originally not seeking success, yet success is established; originally not seeking fame, yet fame is achieved.” This precisely echoes this chapter’s “Only by not dwelling does it not depart.”\n\nFor all things under heaven, nothing exists without its counterpart; where there is contradiction, there is advancement. Thus, where there is beauty, a yet more beautiful contends with it, and beauty as beauty ceases to be beautiful. Where there is goodness, a yet greater goodness contends with it, and goodness as goodness ceases to be good. Therefore, being and non-being form a pair: the myriad things under heaven are born of being, and being is born of non-being—this is the mutual arising of being and non-being. Difficulty and ease form a pair: difficulty is made manifest by ease, and ease is made evident by difficulty. Without difficulty, there would be no way to know ease; without ease, there would be no way to know difficulty—this is the mutual completion of difficulty and ease. Long and short form a pair: an inch is short compared to a foot, and a foot is long compared to an inch. Without length, there would be no way to clarify shortness; without shortness, there would be no way to perceive length—this is the mutual shaping of long and short. High and low form a pair: mountains collapse into valleys, and valleys subside into mountains. Without mountains, there would be no way to perceive valleys; without valleys, there would be no way to know mountains—this is the mutual inclining of high and low. Sound and tone form a pair: joy and sorrow, lament and resentment arise differently. Without sorrow, there would be no way to know joy; without joy, there would be no way to know sorrow—this is the mutual harmony of sound and tone. Before and after form a pair: the former is seen by the latter, and the latter is made clear by the former. Without the latter, there would be no way to know the former; without the former, there would be no way to know the latter—this is the mutual following of before and after (following Yan Junping’s interpretation).\n\nFrom this perspective, all things under heaven are nowhere without contradiction, and nowhere are they not in mutual opposition, each acting in their own way. Only those without intention, who follow nature, do not seek success or fame, but govern by relying on things as they are. “Abiding in the affairs of non-action, practicing the teaching without words,” they penetrate deeply the principle of the myriad things’ mutual opposition and completion, waxing and waning, advancing with the times. The myriad things arise, yet I do not initiate; what I enact does not burden me with traces. Success achieved and affairs completed, I withdraw from my position. It cannot be deemed beautiful, hence it cannot be deemed ugly; it cannot be deemed first, hence it cannot be deemed last. Standing prior to opposition is called not dwelling; transcending the six realms of being and non-being is called not possessing. Possessing yet not possessing, things cannot precede it; dwelling in non-dwelling, it thus does not depart.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang Yong’s reading:\n*Sheng* (生), *cheng* (成), *xing* (形), *qing* (倾) rhyme (in the *geng* 耕 rhyme group);\n*he* (和), *sui* (随) rhyme (in the *ge* 歌 rhyme group; *sui* is read as *xu he* 徐禾);\n*shi* (事), *jiao* (教), *ci* (辞), *you* (有), *shi* (恃) rhyme (merging the *zhi* 之 and *xiao* 宵 rhyme groups; *jiao* follows the *xieyin ji* 协音记, *ci* is in the departing tone, *you* is read as *yi* 以);\n*ju* (居), *ju* (居), *qu* (去) rhyme (in the *yu* 鱼 rhyme group; *qu* is in the level tone).\n\nYao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur, though they do not address *shi* (事) and *jiao* (教). Chen Zhu further pairs *yi* (已) with *yi* (已) as rhymes.\n\nQian Zhi notes: In the Dunhuang, Suizhou, Fu, and Fan editions, *ci* (辞) appears as *shi* (始), while in the Dunhuang edition, *ju* (居) is written as *chu* (处). Karlgren reads *shi* (始) as rhyming with *shi* (事), *jiao* (教), *you* (有), and *shi* (恃), and *chu* (处) as rhyming with *qu* (去). Moreover, *jiao* (教) belongs to the *xiao* (宵) rhyme group, while *shi* (事), *ci* (辞), *you* (有), and *shi* (恃) belong to the *zhi* (之) group, merging *zhi* and *xiao* as a single rhyme.\n\nGu Yanwu states: *Sui* (随) in ancient pronunciation is *ju he* (句禾反), citing the *Laozi*’s “sounds and voices harmonize, front and rear follow” (*yin sheng xiang he, qian hou xiang sui* 音声相和，前后相随), where *he* (和) and *sui* (随) rhyme. Corroborating evidence includes the *Guanzi*’s *Baixin* chapter: “Without a leader, there is no harmony” (*ren bu chang bu he* 人不倡不和), and “Without beginning, there is no following” (*bu shi bu sui* 不始不随). The *Hanfeizi*’s *Jie Lao* states: “When great villainy arises, petty thieves follow; when great villainy leads, petty thieves harmonize” (*da jian zuo ze xiao dao sui, da jian chang ze xiao dao he* 大奸作则小盗随，大奸唱则小盗和), and “Thus when the *yu* leads, the *zhong* and *se* must follow; when the *yu* sings, all instruments harmonize” (*gu yu xian ze zhong se bi sui, yu chang ze zhu yue jie he* 故竽先则钟瑟必随，竽唱则诸乐皆和”) (*Tang Yun Zheng*, *Zhi* 5).\n\nJiang Yougao states: *Ci* (辞) is pronounced *si zi* (似兹切), but in ancient times it had a departing tone, as in the *Laozi*’s *Yangshen* chapter: “The myriad things arise yet do not decline” (*wan wu zuo yan er bu ci* 万物作焉而不辞), rhyming with *shi* (事) and *jiao* (教). He further notes: *Ju* (居) is pronounced *jiu yu* (九鱼切), but in ancient times it also had a departing tone and should be grouped with the *yu* (御) rhyme. In the *Laozi*’s *Yangshen* chapter, “Achieving merit yet not dwelling” (*gong cheng er bu ju* 功成而不居) rhymes with *qu* (去) (*Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng*, *Zhi* 7 and *Yu* 9).\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele edition contains seventy-eight characters; the Dunhuang edition, eighty-five; the Heshang, Wang Bi, and Fu Yi editions, eighty-eight; the Fan Yingyuan edition, ninety-seven. The Heshang edition titles this “Nurturing Life, II” (alternatively, “The Chapter of Beauty and Goodness”), the Wang Bi edition titles it “Chapter Two,” and the Fan edition titles it “When All Under Heaven Know, Chapter Two.”\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt worthies, and the people will not contend;\nDo not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered.\n\nYan Kejun states: In all editions, *shang* (上) appears as *shang* (尚). Luo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang edition reads *bu shang bao* (不上宝). Qian Zhi observes: *Shang* (上) is correct; *bao* (宝) is likely an error. *Shang* (上) and *shang* (尚) are interchangeable. The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su* chapter quotes the *Laozi*: “‘Do not exalt worthies’ means not luring fish into trees or sinking birds into the abyss” (*bu shang xian* 不上贤), also using *shang* (上), consistent with the *Jinglong*, Dunhuang, and Suizhou editions. The Suizhou edition writes *min* (民) as *ren* (人), as does the following clause.\n\nDo not value hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal.\nQian Zhi notes: The Heshang, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions all include *wei* (为) after *dao* (盗), while the Suizhou, Dunhuang, and *Yuzhu* editions omit it, as does this stele. The *Beitang Shuchao* (27) cites it as “Do not value goods, and the people will not steal” (*bu gui huo, shi min bu dao* 不贵货，使民不盗), also lacking *wei* (为).\n\nDo not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered.\nYan Kejun states: In Wang Bi’s edition, *shi* (使) is followed by *min* (民). Bi Yuan notes: The Heshang edition reads “and the heart will not be disordered” (*shi xin bu luan* 使心不乱), omitting *min* (民). The *Huainanzi* also omits it. Yi Shunding states: The *Jin Shu*’s biography of Wu Yinzhi reads: “Do not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered” (*bu jian ke yu, shi xin bu luan* 不见可欲，使心不乱). The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Dongjing Fu* and Shen Yue’s commentary on the *Zhongshan* poem both omit *min* (民). Wang Bing’s commentary on the *Suwen* (1) also omits it. Ji Yun states: The original and all editions lack *min* (民), except the *Yongle Dadian*, which includes it. According to Wang Bi’s commentary, “Thus what is desirable is not displayed” (*gu ke yu bu jian* 故可欲不见), following “risking life to steal” (*mo ming wei dao* 没命为盗), the text originally included *min* (民). Liu Shipei states: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Dongjing Fu* cites it as “and the heart will not be disordered” (*shi xin bu luan* 使心不乱), and Kong Yingda’s commentary on the *Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram also omits *min* (民), likely due to Tang-era taboo deletions. The ancient text actually included *min* (民), consistent with the two preceding instances.\n\nQian Zhi counters: Ji and Liu’s arguments are incorrect. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: “Breaking in, prying into chests, risking life to steal—thus when what is desirable is not displayed, the heart has nothing to disorder” (*chuan yu tan qie, mo ming er dao, gu ke yu bu jian, ze xin wu suo luan ye* 穿窬探箧，没命而盗，故可欲不见，则心无所乱也), showing Wang’s edition lacked *min* (民). The *Yongle Dadian* likely follows Wu Cheng’s edition in erroneously adding it. Liu claims the omission resulted from Tang-era taboo deletions, unaware that the ancient text lacked *min* (民). The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (34) also omits it. If this were related to taboos, why were the two preceding *min* (民) not also deleted? This is not a case of arbitrary deletion but of arbitrary addition. However, Wu Cheng had a basis: Chu Suiliang’s postscript to Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy (dated Zhenguan 15) reads “and the people’s hearts will not be disordered” (*min xin bu luan* 民心不乱), matching the Fu and Fan editions, indicating the error is long-standing. Though the Fu and Fan editions claim antiquity, they were altered by later hands, their wording often more verbose than other editions—this is one example.\n\nThe sage governs:\nYan Kejun states: All editions include *shi yi* (是以) before this clause, and Wang Bi’s edition adds *zhi* (之) after *ren* (人). Wu Yun notes: The Fu edition reads “The sage’s governance” (*sheng ren zhi zhi* 圣人之治) followed by *ye* (也); Li Daochun omits *zhi zhi* (之治). Qian Zhi observes: Including *zhi* (之) is correct.\n\nEmpty their hearts, fill their bellies, weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Shiwen* records *qiang* (强) as also written *qiang* (强).\n\nThe Dunhuang manuscript reads *qiang* (强). Qian Zhi observes: The Lou Zheng edition also reads *qiang* (强). Furthermore, *Qunshu Zhiyao*, juan 34, cites: “Thus the sage’s governance constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,” omitting the four phrases “empty their hearts, fill their bellies, weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.”\n\nConstantly keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\nYan Kejun states: “Constantly keep the people” (*chang shi min* 常使民) appears as “keep people” (*shi ren* 使人) in the *Yu Zhu* edition. Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yu Zhu* edition avoids the taboo by using *ren* (人). Qian Zhi observes: The Wang Xizhi edition omits *chang* (常), while the Suizhou stele edition omits *min* (民).\n\nLet the knowing ones not dare to act, and there will be nothing left ungverned.\nYan Kejun states: “Let the knowing ones” (*shi zhi zhe* 使知者) includes the character *fu* (夫) after *shi* (使) in all editions. “Not dare to act” (*bu gan wei* 不敢为) is followed by the three characters *wei wu wei* (为无为) in all editions, and by the four characters *ye wei wu wei* (也为无为) in Wang Bi’s edition. Luo Zhenyu notes: *Zhi* (知) appears as *zhi* (智) in modern editions; the *Shiwen* lists the two characters *zhi zhe* (知者) and glosses *zhi* (智), indicating that Wang Bi’s edition originally read *zhi* (知). The Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, and Dunhuang editions also read *zhi* (知). Moreover, the Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions all omit *ye* (也) after *wei* (为). Qian Zhi observes: According to Luo’s facsimile of the *Zhen Song Tang Cang Xirui Miji Congcan* collation of the Dunhuang manuscript, *bu* (不) appears after *gan* (敢), an omission in Luo’s *Kaoyi*. The Suizhou stele edition also reads *bu gan bu wei ye* (不敢不为也).\n\nQiang Siqi cites Cheng Xuanying’s commentary: “Having already relinquished both desire and non-desire, one further fears that those without desire may become attached to the view of emptiness, taking non-desire as the Dao. Thus, ‘not daring not to act’ (*bu gan bu wei* 不敢不为) is to dispel non-desire. One fears clinging to this non-action, hence the subsequent ‘not daring’ (*bu gan* 不敢).” Cheng’s commentary also originally read *bu gan bu wei* (不敢不为). Only Gu’s edition of Cheng’s commentary reads “thus, ‘not daring to act’ (*bu gan wei* 不敢为) is to dispel non-desire,” omitting this *bu* (不). Now, *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) are two distinct matters, corresponding to the earlier “without knowledge, without desire” (*wu zhi, wu yu* 无知、无欲). The phrase should be punctuated after *bu gan* (不敢).\n\nIn Chapter 30 of the text, “not by seizing strength” (*bu yi qu qiang* 不以取强), all editions include *gan* (敢) after *bu* (不), but *gan* (敢) is a superfluous character. However, in Chapter 67, “I dare not act as the first in the world” (*bu gan wei tian xia xian* 不敢为天下先); in Chapter 69, “I dare not act as the host but act as the guest, dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot” (*wu bu gan wei zhu er wei ke, bu gan jin cun er tui chi* 吾不敢为主而为客，不敢进寸而退尺); and in Chapter 73, “Being brave in not daring brings life” (*yong yu bu gan ze huo* 勇于不敢则活), *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) are paired, indicating that Gu’s edition of Cheng’s commentary contains errors of omission in the base text. Laozi’s original meaning is this: constantly keep the general populace without knowledge and without desire, and constantly keep the few who know from daring to act or acting. In this way, there will be spontaneous transformation through tranquility, and nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nFurthermore, *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) constitute “governing by not governing” (*bu zhi zhi zhi* 不治治之). The *Lunheng*, in its “Naturalness” chapter, states: “When Qu Boyu governed Wei, Zigong sent someone to ask him, ‘How do you govern Wei?’ He replied, ‘I govern it by not governing.’ This ‘governing by not governing’ is the Dao of non-action.” This meaning derives from Laozi. Laozi’s intent is that the highest governance is no governance. What the world calls governance—exalting the worthy causes the people to contend; prizing rare goods causes the people to steal; displaying what is desirable disturbs their hearts. Now, if one reverses this, so that the people see no one to exalt, no goods to prize, and nothing to desire, then they will return to simplicity and preserve purity. Constantly keeping the people without knowledge and without desire, they will naturally become tranquil, neither contending nor stealing nor disordering. This is why the knowing ones dare not act. In an age of perfect virtue, the ruler is like the tip of a branch, and the people are like wild deer—chewing their food in joy, drumming their bellies in play. This is the ancient era of non-action, where the people transform themselves, soaring in spontaneity, and nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* finds no rhyme. Karlgren takes *fu* (腹), *gu* (骨), and *yu* (欲) as rhyming, as does Chen Zhu. Chen further takes *zhi* (治) as rhyming with them, stating: “This is likely a shift in the sound of *ge* (歌).” Qian Zhi observes: Wang Niansun’s *Mao Shi Qun Jing Chu Ci Gu Yun Pu* places *yu* (欲) and *fu* (腹) in the *you* (幽) rhyme group, citing the *Yue Ji*: “The noble person delights in attaining the Dao” (*jun zi le de qi dao* 君子乐得其道), where *dao* (道) and *yu* (欲) rhyme. In the fourth stanza of the *Shijing*’s “Liao’e,” *ju* (鞫), *xu* (蓄), *yu* (育), *fu* (复), and *fu* (腹) rhyme. In the *Chu Ci*’s “Tian Wen,” *yu* (育) and *fu* (腹) rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi further observes: *xian* (贤) and *zheng* (争) rhyme. Kong Guangsen’s *Shi Sheng Lei*, in the second section on yang sounds, lists the character *jian* (坚) under the twentieth entry, stating: “In the *Xing Wei* (行苇): ‘The sturdy bows are already firm (*jian* 坚), the four arrows are already balanced, the arrows are already released in order, and the guests are arranged by worthiness (*xian* 贤).’ The character *jian* (坚) is derived from *○*, which is the ancient form of *xian* (贤). Today, in the seventeenth division of the *zhen* (真) rhyme, there is the character *xian* (礥), which is the correct pronunciation of *xian* (贤).” He further lists *xian* (贤), stating: “In the *Bei Shan* (北山): ‘The great officers are not equal, and I alone am worthy (*xian* 贤) in my tasks.’ See *jian* (坚) above.” Now, *xian* (贤) and *zheng* (争) are phonetically close; the old Indian translation of *xian dou* (贤豆) serves as collateral evidence. Wang Niansun’s *Gu Yun Pu* places *xian* (贤) in the *zhen* (真) rhyme group alongside *jian* (坚), while *zheng* (争, pronounced *zhen* 真) is in the *geng* (耕) group. This serves as evidence for the interrhyming of *zhen* (真) and *geng* (耕).\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains 57 characters; the Dunhuang edition, 58; the Heshang edition, 66; the Wang Bi edition, 67; the Fu edition, 68; and the Fan edition, 69.\n\nThe *Heshang* edition titles this \"Pacifying the People, Third,\" the *Wang* edition titles it \"Chapter Three,\" and the *Fan* edition titles it \"The Chapter on Not Exalting the Worthy, Third.\"\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is empty (*chong*), yet its use is inexhaustible.\nYan Qian notes: “*Chong* (冲) appears as *zhong* (盅) in Fu Yi’s edition. *Zhong* is the ancient form of *chong*.” The *Shuowen* under the *min* (皿) radical states: “*Zhong*: a vessel’s emptiness. *Laozi* says, ‘The Dao is empty (*zhong*) and thus used.’” Guo Zhongshu’s *Han Jian* (上之二) cites the character *chong* (冲), quoting the ancient *Laozi* as ○.\nBi Yuan says: “The *Shuowen Jiezi* cites this text as *zhong*, while all other editions read *chong*. The *Huainanzi* also reads *chong*, but both are incorrect.” For emptiness within a vessel is called *zhong*; being empty, it holds things. Thus, the *Zhuangzi*’s “Responding to Emperors” states: “Great emptiness (*zhong*) is invincible.”\nYan Kejun says: “‘Inexhaustible over time’ (*jiu bu ying*)—other editions read ‘perhaps inexhaustible’ (*huo bu ying*).” Luo Zhenyu says: The Jinglong stele reads *jiu* (久), while the Dunhuang edition reads *you* (又), a corruption of *jiu*. Yu Yue says: “‘The Dao is empty (*zhong*) and thus used’—*zhong* means emptiness, directly opposing *ying* (盈, fullness). *Chong* is a borrowed character.” In Chapter 45, “Great fullness seems empty (*chong*),” *chong* should also be written as *zhong*.\nHe further notes: “‘Perhaps inexhaustible’ (*huo bu ying*)—the Tang Jinglong stele reads ‘inexhaustible over time’ (*jiu bu ying*). Emptiness that remains inexhaustible over time is true emptiness (*zhong*), far superior to modern editions.” The *Heshang Gong* commentary states: “*Huo* means ‘constant.’” To gloss *huo* as “constant” is unattested in antiquity; the *Heshang* edition likely originally read *jiu*.\nYan Qian notes: The reading *jiu* is correct. The *Taiping Yulan* (322) quotes the *Mozi*: “One who skillfully maintains victory weakens the strong, hence *Laozi* says, ‘The Dao is empty (*chong*) and thus used, yet it is not full (*you bu ying*).’” *You bu ying* (有弗盈) means *you bu ying* (又不盈). Jia Changchao’s *Qun Jing Yin Bian* states: “*You* means *you* (又). Wang Bi’s commentary reads: ‘Thus it is empty and used, yet again not full (*you fu bu ying*).’” This shows the *Wang* edition also reads *you*, not *huo*. *You*, *you*, and *jiu* were interchangeable in antiquity.\nMa Xulun says: “The *Mozi* quotes it as *you*, the *Heshang* as *huo*, and the Yizhou edition as *jiu*—these four characters were interchangeable in antiquity. *You* (又), *you* (有), and *huo* (或) were mutually interchangeable, as seen in the *Jingzhuan Shici*. In meaning, *jiu* is superior. *You* (又), *you* (有), and *jiu* (久) are also interchangeable. The *Zhuangzi*’s ‘Perfect Joy’ reads: ‘Man *you* (又) returns to the mechanism.’ The *Liezi*’s ‘Heaven’s Endowment’ reads *jiu* (久) for *you*. The *Liezi*’s ‘Heaven’s Endowment’ states: ‘The spirit is heaven’s *jiu* (久).’ Yin Jingshun and Chen Jingyuan’s *Shiwen* note: ‘*Jiu* is pronounced *you* and originally written *you* (又).’ The *Hanshu*’s ‘Yang Wangsun’ says: ‘The spirit is heaven’s *you* (有).’ This is drawn from the same passage, serving as further evidence. The sounds of *you* (又), *jiu* (久), and *you* (有) all belong to the same phonetic category.”\nYan Qian notes: In Fu Yi’s edition, *ying* (盈) appears as *man* (满). Lu Deming says: “*Ying* is also written *man* in some editions.” *Ying* and *man* share the same meaning. The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (13) cites the *Shuowen*: “*Ying* means ‘a vessel full.’” The two Xu editions read “full vessel.” Tian Qian says: “Under the *shui* (水) radical, *yi* (溢) is defined as ‘a vessel full.’ A full vessel is *yi*, which is also *ying*. Thus, under *man* (满), it states: ‘*Ying* means overflowing.’ The gloss is quite clear.” This confirms that *ying* and *man* are interchangeable, though the original text should read *ying*.\nMa Xulun says: “The character *man* in other editions appears as *ying* because, as Xun Yue says: ‘To avoid the taboo on *ying*, it was changed to *man*.’ Emperor Hui of Han was named *Ying*, so the character was altered to *man* in deference. Thus, *ying* is the original form.” Profound indeed!\n\n\"The myriad things take it as their ancestor.\"\n\nYan Kejun says: “‘Profound indeed!’—the *Yu zhu* edition reads ‘abyssal-like,’ the *Heshang Gong* edition reads ‘abyssal-like indeed,’ and Wang Bi’s edition reads ‘abyssal ah, like.’ For ‘the myriad things take it as their ancestor,’ the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions include the word *zhi* (‘of’) after *wu* (‘things’).”\n\nLuo Zhenyu says: The Dunhuang manuscript reads, “abyssal-like, the ancestor of the myriad things.”\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Shi wen* gives “abyssal ○,” adding: “The *Heshang Gong* edition reads *hu* (‘indeed’).” Bi Yuan says: “○ is the ancient form of the character *xi* (‘ah’).” Lu Wenchang says: “‘○’ in modern editions is uniformly written as *xi* (‘ah’).”\n\nFurthermore, the editions of Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan read: “abyssal ah, like the ancestor of the myriad things.” In Fan’s edition, the character *wan* (‘myriad’) is consistently written as its variant form. The *Yu pian* states: “‘万’ is the vulgar form of ‘萬,’ meaning ten thousand.” This single example shows that Fan’s edition preserves many ancient glosses and also retains vulgar characters.\n\nIt is also noted that *shen* (‘profound’) and *yuan* (‘abyssal’) share the same meaning. The *Yu pian* defines *yuan* as “water still and deep.” The *Xiao Er Ya Guang yu* states: “‘Abyssal’ means ‘deep.’” Lao Jian says: “The *Jinglong* edition reads ‘profound indeed, the ancestor of the myriad things.’ This was likely changed from *yuan* (‘abyssal’) to *shen* (‘profound’) to avoid a Tang taboo.”\n\n\"Blunt its sharpness, untie its tangles, harmonize its brilliance, and unite with its dust.\"\n\nYu Yue remarks: According to the *Shiwen*, the Heshang Gong edition writes *fen* (‘tangled’) as *fen* (‘fragrant’); yet the character *fen* (‘fragrant’) carries no meaning here. This line also appears in Chapter 56, where Heshang Gong annotates: “‘Tangled’ means knotted resentment.” ... In that chapter, he comments: “‘Tangled’ means unceasing knotted resentment.” The annotations are largely identical. Thus, the Heshang edition’s *fen* (‘fragrant’) should be read as *fen* (‘resentment’). If taken literally, the gloss’s meaning of “knotted resentment” becomes unintelligible. ... Wang Bi’s edition of Chapter 56 writes *jie qi fen* (‘untie its divisions’), with the note: “Eliminate the source of contention.” Here, too, *fen* is read as *fen* (‘resentment’). Gu Huan’s edition correctly writes *fen* (‘resentment’), which is the proper character, while *fen* (‘fragrant’) and *fen* (‘tangled’) are both loan characters.\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: “‘Untie its tangles’ appears in Heshang Gong’s edition as *fen* (‘fragrant’).” He notes that *fen* (‘fragrant’) should be *fen* (‘resentment’). This line appears in Chapter 4 and again in Chapter 56. In the old manuscript of the Heshang Gong edition, the latter chapter writes *fen* (‘resentment’), while this chapter writes *fen* (‘tangled’). Wang Bi’s edition of Chapter 56 writes *fen* (‘divisions’), but his annotation reveals that *fen* (‘divisions’) is a corruption of *fen* (‘resentment’). This chapter aligns with the old manuscript of the Heshang Gong edition, and both Wang Bi’s and Heshang Gong’s editions share the same character. By the time of the *Jinglong* stele and the Dunhuang manuscript, *fen* (‘tangled’) in this chapter was revised to *fen* (‘resentment’), restoring the loan character to its proper form.\n\nTan Xian observes: Chapter 56 also includes the four lines “Blunt its sharpness...,” suggesting a possible interpolation. “Abiding in stillness, it seems ever-present.”\n\nYan Kejun notes: Heshang Gong’s edition reads *zhan xi si ruo cun* (‘still, it seems as if present’), while Wang Bi’s edition reads *zhan xi si huo cun* (‘still, it seems perhaps present’).\n\nLuo Zhenyu states: Both the *Jinglong* and *Imperial Commentary* editions read *zhan chang cun* (‘still, ever-present’), while the Dunhuang edition reads *zhan si chang cun* (‘still, it seems ever-present’).\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio adds: The Dunhuang edition of this line reads *zhan ran chang cun* (‘still and ever-present’), while the Suzhou edition reads *zhan si chang cun* (‘still, it seems ever-present’).\n\nWang Chang remarks: The Xingzhou edition includes the character *zhi* (‘it’) after *shui* (‘who’) in the following line.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan editions match Wang Bi’s version. The Xingzhou edition was once thought to be the Suzhou edition, but this is now known to be incorrect. In Chapter 14, the line “This is called the indistinct and evanescent” is recorded by Wang Chang as identical across all editions, though the Xingzhou edition omits it. However, the Suzhou edition does include it, writing *shi wei hu huang* (‘This is called indistinct and evanescent’), providing further evidence.\n\nThe character *zhan* (‘still’), as defined in the *Shuowen*, means “submerged.” The *Xiao Er Ya Guang Yu* states: “‘Submerged’ means ‘nonexistent.’” Here, “still and ever-present” describes its empty numinosity, unobscured—seemingly nonexistent yet truly present.\n\n“Whose child am I? The ancestor of the Divine Sovereign.”\n\nYan Kejun states: “‘Whose child’ is rendered as ‘whose child’ (*shui zhi zi*) in the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions.” Jiao Hong notes: “‘Whose child’ (*shui zhi zi*) is absent in Chen Bixu’s Sima edition.” Luo Zhenyu observes: “The Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and Dunhuang versions all omit the character *zhi* (‘whose’).” Qian Zhiji comments: The Muromachi edition includes *qi* (‘its’) before *shui* (‘who’) and *zhi* (‘whose’) after it. However, the omission of *zhi* is correct. The *Guang Ya*’s *Shi Yan* states: “‘Child’ (*zi*) means ‘resembles’ (*si*).” Thus, “I know not whose child” (*wu bu zhi shui zi*) means “I know not whom it resembles,” and the meaning is complete. This passage asks: Is it spirit? Is it sovereign? The one this world calls the master of life and death—yet the Dao alone precedes it. The Dao dwells in the realm of doubt and semblance, as if one knew not whose child it is; yet it is self-so and self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth and enduring since antiquity.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhymes, according to Jiang Yong: *fen* (纷), *chen* (尘), *cun* (存), and *xian* (先) rhyme (Wen rhyme group; *xian* read as *si yin*). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur. Deng notes: “‘*Xian*’ was anciently read like ‘*shen*.’” Qian Zhiji adds: *zhong* (盅), *ying* (盈), and *zong* (宗) also rhyme. Xi Di, Chen Zhu, and Bernhard Karlgren agree. Yao Nai states: “‘The Dao is empty’ (*dao chong*) forms a phrase, rhyming with *zong* (宗), signifying the Dao’s essence as utterly empty.” Xi Di notes: *zhong* (盅), *ying* (盈), and *zong* (宗) rhyme. The shift between Dong and Geng rhyme groups is seen elsewhere, as in Chapter 24, where *gong* (功) rhymes with *ming* (明), and in the *Zhuangzi*’s “In You” chapter, where *chong* (虫) rhymes with *qing* (情), *cheng* (成), and *ming* (鸣). Further, *fen* (纷), *chen* (尘), and *xian* (先) rhyme. The *Huangdi Neijing Suwen*’s “Eight Rectifications’ Spiritual Clarity” chapter rhymes *xian* (先) with *shen* (神) and *cun* (存), while the *Chu Ci*’s “Summons of the Soul” rhymes *xian* (先) with *fen* (纷) and *chen* (陈). Qian Daxin states: The *Shuowen* reads *chong* (冲) like *dong* (动). The *Book of Documents*’ “I am but a youth” (*yu wei chong ren*) is glossed in the *Shi Wen* as *zhi zhong* (直忠反). Anciently, *zhi* (直) was read like *te* (特), so *chong zi* (冲子) is akin to *dong zi* (动子). Qian Zhiji further notes: “Ever-present in stillness” (*zhan chang cun*)—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include *xi* (兮) after *zhan* (湛). The particle *xi* is most common in the *Chu Ci*, and the *Laozi* already marks its beginning. Kong Guangsen’s *Shi Sheng Lei* (7) states: “‘*Xi*’ appears in the *Tang* rhyme group under twelve *qi*, but its ancient pronunciation lacks firm evidence. Yet the *Tai Shi*’s ‘*duan duan yi*’ is cited in the *Great Learning* as ‘*duan duan xi*’, suggesting *xi* and *yi* share sound and meaning. *Yi* was anciently read as *e* (阿), so *xi* should likewise be read as *e*.”\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains thirty-seven characters and is not divided into chapters.\n\nThe Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Fu Yi versions contain forty-two characters; the Fan Yingyuan version, forty-three; and the Dunhuang version, thirty-nine. (Takeuchi’s edition states “thirty-seven characters,” but it is actually thirty-nine. Luo’s scroll annotation reads “forty-nine characters,” where “four” is a miswriting of “three.”) Heshang Gong titles it “Chapter Four: No Source,” Wang Bi titles it “Chapter Four,” and Fan Yingyuan titles it “Chapter Four: The Dao’s Impulse.”\n\n---\n\nChapter Five\nHeaven and earth are not humane,\nTreating the myriad things as *chugou*;\nThe sage is not humane,\nTreating the hundred clans as *chugou*.\n\nYan Kejun notes: “○○” are variant characters.\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong and Guangming editions write “○,” while the Dunhuang edition writes “○,” both variant forms of *chu* (刍).\nQian Zhiji observes: The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan versions all write *chugou* (刍狗). See *Shiwen* and *Qunshu Zhiyao*.\n\nLi Wenzhong (zi Jian) states: “‘*Chu* (刍),’ as per the *Shuowen*, means ‘to cut grass,’ depicting the form of bundled grass. The Suizhou edition writes *chu* as ‘二屮,’ which is the character *cao* (草). The common addition of ‘grass’ is incorrect.”\nLiu Shipei notes: *Chugou* refers to objects used in ancient sacrificial rites. The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* states: “It is like the initial completion of *chugou* or earthen dragons: adorned with blue and yellow, draped in fine silk, bound with vermilion threads, the spirit-mediums in ceremonial dress, the grand officers in full regalia, to send them off and welcome them back. Yet once used, they become mere clods of earth and bundles of grass—who would value them?” Gao You’s commentary: “*Chugou* are straw dogs made of bundled grass, used to seek blessings and atone for transgressions.” The *Shuo Shan Xun* says: “The sage employs things as if binding *chugou* with vermilion threads,” and further: “*Chugou* are treated with reverence to seek blessings.” Gao’s commentary: “By honoring the spirit of *chugou*, one obtains blessings.” Thus, in ancient sacrifices, *chugou* were universally used to seek blessings. They are straw dogs made of bundled grass, akin to straw effigies—objects used at first but discarded afterward. Laozi’s meaning here is that heaven and earth treat the myriad things, and the sage treats the hundred clans, as things first used and then abandoned, hence the analogy to *chugou* to condemn their lack of humanity.\nQian Zhiji notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Gui Gong* chapter cites the same two lines from Laozi in Gao You’s commentary. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Gengsang Chu* chapter states: “Perfect humanity has no partiality,” the *Qi Wu Lun* states: “Great humanity is not humane,” and the *Tian Yun* chapter states: “Before *chugou* are displayed, they are stored in fine baskets, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the spirit-mediums fast and purify themselves to present them. Once displayed, passersby trample their heads and spines, while gatherers of fuel take them to burn.” All these passages derive from this.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, it is like a bellows. Yan Kejun notes: \"蘥\" in the *Yu zhu* edition appears as \"橐钥\"; the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions lack the particle \"乎.\" Qian Zhiji notes: Wang Bi’s commentary states, \"‘橐’ is a push-bellows; ‘钥’ is a musical pipe.\" Sun Yirang says: \"According to the *Yiqie jing yinyi*, the *Dongguan Hanji* writes ‘排,’ while Wang Bi’s commentary uses ‘,’ both pronounced *pibai*, referring to the device used by smiths to blow fire and make it blaze. Another entry (vol. 12) states, ‘排筒,’ where the *Dongguan Hanji* reads ‘因水作排,’ and Wang Bi’s commentary explains, ‘橐 is a bag.’ (The *Yupian*’s *○* section defines ‘’ as ‘a bellows for blowing fire.’) Based on Xuanying’s account, the Wang Bi commentary he saw rendered ‘排橐’ as ‘bag,’ whereas modern editions and Lu Deming’s *Shiwen* both write ‘排橐’ (*Shiwen* notes: ‘排, *fubai*’—the same sound as *pibai*. ‘排橐’ also appears in the *Huainanzi*’s *Benjing xun* with Gao You’s commentary). The character ‘排’ aligns with the *Hanji*, suggesting that Wang Bi’s commentary may have existed in two versions during the Tang dynasty.\" (Modern editions of Wang Bi’s commentary do not separate the *Dao* and *Virtue* chapters, differing from the *Shiwen* version. Furthermore, the *Bianzheng lun* by Shi Falin cites commentary on the chapter \"Man models himself on earth, earth on heaven,\" which diverges from modern editions—additional evidence that Wang Bi’s commentary circulated in variant versions during the Tang.)\n\nThe interpretation of *yue* as a musical pipe aligns with Cheng Xuanying’s view (\"钥 is a panpipe\") but differs from Wu Cheng’s explanation of *tuoyue*. Wu Cheng states: \"‘橐钥’ refers to the device used in smelting to blow air and intensify the fire. The outer casing that encloses it is the *tuo* (bellows); the inner mechanism that fans the air is the *yue* (pipe). That heaven and earth resemble a *tuoyue* means the *tuo* symbolizes the great void, embodying the all-encompassing and pervasive body, while the *yue* symbolizes primordial *qi*, manifesting the dynamic and flowing function.\" Wu’s interpretation is more compelling.\n\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, moving and ever producing. Yan Kejun notes: Wang Bi and Gu Huan write \"不掘.\" \"俞出\" appears as \"愈出\" in most editions. Qian Zhiji notes: The Fu and Fan editions also write \"俞.\" Luo Zhenyu says: The modern Wang Bi edition writes \"屈,\" consistent with the *Jinglong*, *Yu zhu*, and *Jingfu* editions. The *Shiwen* includes the variant \"掘,\" indicating Wang Bi’s original text used \"掘.\" The *Shiwen* further notes: \"The *Heshang Gong* edition writes *qu* (屈), while Gu writes *jue* (掘).\" Qian Zhiji notes: The correct reading is \"屈.\" Wang Bi’s commentary states, \"Thus empty yet not exhaustibly bent,\" confirming that Wang Bi’s original text used \"屈,\" as does the Fan edition. The Fu edition writes \"诎\" for \"屈.\" Lao Jian says: \"According to the *Shuowen*, ‘屈’ means tailless, extended to denote anything short, hence the sense of exhaustion. ‘诎’ means bent, the original character for ‘bending and straightening.’ *Jue* (掘) and *hu* (搰) gloss each other. The *Shiwen* cites Gu’s note ‘like exhaustion,’ treating it as a loan for *qu* (屈). The Fu edition’s ‘诎’ misinterprets it as bending and straightening, which is incorrect. This character should be ‘屈,’ glossed as exhaustion, pronounced *jue*.\" Bi Yuan says: \"俞\" appears as \"愈\" in all editions. However, the ancient character for ‘愈’ did not exist; it is likely a substitution for ‘俞.’ All editions are incorrect.\"\n\nToo many words lead to frequent exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.\n\nQian’s note: Takeuchi Yoshio states: \"The Dun and Sui editions both write ‘loyalty’ (忠).\" The fragmentary Dunhuang manuscript of the *Heshang* edition held in the Bibliothèque nationale de France reads \"abide in loyalty\" (守忠), matching the Sui Prefecture stele. However, the character \"loyalty\" (忠) lacks semantic coherence here. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* quotes the preceding two lines as \"abide in the center\" (守中), which is correct. Furthermore, the phrase \"many words\" (多言) appears as \"much learning\" (多聞) in the Sui Prefecture stele, and the *Wenzi*’s *Daoyuan* chapter likewise cites it as \"much learning.\" In his *Chengshu*, Qiang Ben glosses: \"‘Much learning’ means broad and ample; ‘frequent exhaustion’ refers to excessive speech.\" This is merely a forced interpretation based on the Sui edition.\n\nQian further notes: Regarding the \"center\" (中) in \"abide in the center,\" Zhang Binglin’s *Wenshi* 7 states: \"‘Center’ originally referred to documents such as registers. Thus, the *Chun Guan*’s *Tianfu* states: ‘For all offices, prefectures, districts, and towns, the *zhizhong* receives and stores them.’ Zheng Sinong comments: ‘*Zhizhong* refers to the essential records of administrative duties.’ The *Qiu Guan*’s *Xiao Sikou* states: ‘Using the three deliberations, they judge the *zhong* of the people’s lawsuits; at year’s end, they order the officials to tally the concluded cases and present the *zhong* to the *Tianfu*.’ The *Liji*’s *Liyi* states: ‘Relying on famous mountains, they present the *zhong* to Heaven.’ Presenting the *zhong* is like ascending the *zhong*, meaning they offer registers of the people’s numbers and the essentials of governance. The *Yaodian*’s ‘truly grasp its center’ refers to holding the charts and registers.\" The \"abide in the center\" in this chapter carries the same meaning, akin to managing tallies.\n\nLuo Yunxian states: \"‘Center’ is also a tally. Governing does not lie in excessive speech but in upholding the legal tally to assist the world—this is the meaning of ‘non-action.’\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads: *qu* (屈) and *chu* (出) as rhymes (both in the *zhi* group), while *qiong* (穷) and *zhong* (中) rhyme (both in the *zhong* group). All scholars concur. Kong Guangsen’s *Shisheng Lei* 5, in the yang tone’s *dong* category, cites the *Analects*: \"The celestial reckoning is in your person; truly grasp its center. If the Four Seas suffer exhaustion, Heaven’s emolument will forever end.\" The *Daodejing*’s *Daojing* states: \"Many words lead to frequent exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.\" The *Dejing* states: \"Great fullness resembles emptiness; its use is inexhaustible.\" The *Zhuangzi* states: \"I have come and gone, yet know not its end; I wander in vastness, where great knowledge enters yet knows not its exhaustion.\" The *Guanzi* states: \"Promote what is beautiful to observe its end; discard what is detested and surely calculate its exhaustion.\" Generally, the shared rhymes do not extend beyond the three characters *zhong* (中), *zhong* (终), and *qiong* (穷), demonstrating the narrowness of the *dong* rhyme, which cannot be loosely conflated with *dong* or *zhong*.\n\nQian’s note: The *Zhuangzi*’s *Qiwulun* states: \"The pivot begins to grasp its ring’s center to respond to the inexhaustible,\" also rhyming *zhong* (中) and *qiong* (穷). Moreover, in the *Daodejing*, the characters preceding *zhong* (中) and *qiong* (穷)—*shu* (数) and *shou* (守)—also rhyme with each other, forming a \"rhyme above the rhyme.\" This follows Ma Xulun’s explanation, as seen in the postface to the *Mao Shi Zheng Yun*.\n\nThe forty-four characters of the Jinglong stele are presented without chapter divisions, matching the Dunhuang version. The He, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions contain forty-five characters. The He Shang text titles this \"Vacuity and Function, Chapter Five,\" the Wang edition titles it \"Chapter Five,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"Heaven and Earth Are Not Humane, Chapter Five.\"\n\n**Chapter Six**\n\"The valley spirit does not die;\nThis is called the mysterious female.\"\n\nBi Yuan notes: Lu Deming states, \"In the He Shang text, *gu* (谷) is written as *yu* (浴), with the gloss: '*Yu* means to nourish.'\" The Later Han stele inscription by Chen Xiang (Bian Shao) for Laozi also writes it as \"*yu* spirit,\" aligning with the He Shang version. Yu Yue comments: The character *yu* (浴) truly lacks the meaning of nourishment. In the He Shang text, *yu* should be read as *gu* (谷). The *Book of Songs* in the \"Xiao Bian,\" \"Liao E,\" and \"Si Yue\" sections all state: \"None among the people do not *gu*.\" Mao’s commentary consistently glosses *gu* as \"to nourish.\" *Gu* (谷) is also interchangeable with *gu* (谷). The *Erya*’s \"Explanation of Heaven\" states: \"The east wind is called *gu* wind.\" The *Shi Jing* commentary by Sun Yan cites: \"*Gu* is spoken of as *gu*; *gu* means to generate, and generation is also nourishment.\" The version Wang Bi relied upon writes *gu* (谷), which is a loan character for *gu* (谷). The ancient He Shang text writes *yu* (浴), which is a variant of *gu* (谷). Hong Yixuan states: According to the *Explanation of Characters*, the He Shang text writes *yu* (浴). The *Book of Changes* states, \"The noble person restrains anger and suppresses desires,\" where Meng Xi’s version writes *yu* (浴). Both *gu* (谷) and *yu* (浴) are loan characters for *yu* (欲). *Mencius*’ \"Jinxin, Part Two\" states: \"To nourish the mind, nothing is better than reducing desires.\" Thus, it is by desire that the spirit does not die. The *Liexian Zhuan* records: Rongcheng Gong excelled in the arts of supplementation and guiding, drawing essence from the mysterious female. Its essential teaching is that the valley spirit does not die—it is the preservation of life and the nourishment of qi. This aligns with the same meaning. Xu Zi states: According to the He Shang commentary, *gu* is glossed as nourishment, so it should be *gu* (谷). Mao’s commentary on the *Book of Songs*, Zheng’s annotations, and the *Guangya*’s \"Explanation of Terms\" all state: \"*Gu* means to nourish.\" This is because *gu* (谷) and *gu* (谷) are interchangeable, a phonetic loan. The *Book of Documents*’ \"Canon of Yao\" states, \"The western dwelling is called Meigu,\" while the *Rites of Zhou*’s \"Feng Ren\" commentary writes, \"The western measurement is called Liugu.\" This is what the *Da Dai Li Ji* refers to as \"the autumn sacrifice at Liugu.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* writes it as \"Liugu.\" In the *Zhuangzi*, \"Zang and Gu herd sheep,\" Cui Zhuan’s version writes \"Zang and Gu herd sheep,\" serving as evidence. Furthermore, the *Explanation of Characters* states: \"*Gu* is written as *yu* in the He Shang text, with the gloss: '*Yu* means to nourish.'\" This differs from the current version. Hong Kuo’s *Lishi* records the Laozi inscription: \"Some have *yu* spirit does not die.\" Thus, the ancient version originally wrote *yu* (浴). *Gu* (谷) is a loan for *gu* (谷), and *yu* (浴) is in turn a loan for *gu* (谷).\n\nQian’s note: Writing \"*gu* spirit\" is correct. Modern Song editions and the Daozang He Shang text all write *gu* (谷), not *yu* (浴). The *Liezi*’s \"Tian Rui\" chapter cites the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious female.\" Yu Jianwu’s poem states: \"Discussing the Dao ceases at the valley spirit.\" Yu Xin’s poem states: \"In vacuity, nourish the valley spirit.\" The Later Han’s Gao Yifang’s *Qing Jie* states: \"When wisdom and thought are utterly exhausted, the valley spirit endures ceaselessly.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"The two characters *gu* and *shen*, according to Fu Yi, mean 'profound and penetrating.'\" All read *gu shen* as a compound. However, in the *Laozi*, *gu* and *shen* are in fact opposed. Chapter Thirty-Nine states: \"The spirit obtains the One and becomes numinous; the valley obtains the One and becomes full,\" serving as evidence. Sima Guang states: \"It is called *gu* because it is empty within; it is called *shen* because it is unfathomable. Heaven and earth have limits, but the Dao is limitless, hence it is said not to die.\" Yan Fu states: \"Because it is empty, it is called *gu*; because it responds endlessly, it is called *shen*; because it is inexhaustible and ever-emerging, it is said not to die. These three are all virtues of the Dao.\" Thus, reading *gu* and *shen* as a compound is mistaken.\n\n\"The gate of the mysterious female\nIs the root of heaven and earth.\"\n\nYan Kejun states: The He Shang and Wang Bi texts include the character *zhi* (之) before *men* (门) and *shi wei* (是谓) before *tian di* (天地). Qian’s note: The Suizhou, Dunhuang, and Imperial Commentary editions are identical to this stele.\n\n\"Vague and elusive, it seems to endure;\nIn its use, it is not exhausted.\"\n\nQian’s note: *Mianmian* (绵绵) is written as *mianmian* (绵绵) in all other editions. Cheng Xuanying states: \"*Mianmian* describes something subtle and unbroken.\" *Mian* (绵) is a vulgar character. The *Yu Pian* states: \"*Mian* is new silk floss, entangling, unceasing. Now written as *mian* (绵).\" The *Five Classics Textual Criticism* states: \"Writing *mian* (绵) is erroneous.\" Furthermore, after *mianmian* (绵绵), the Jingfu edition includes the character *xi* (兮), and the Shitang edition includes *hu* (乎). The character *qin* (勤) is written as *qin* (懃) in Takeuchi’s collated edition. Hong Yixuan states: *Qin* (勤) is interchangeable with *qin* (廑). Li Shan’s commentary on the *Wen Xuan*’s \"Changyang Fu\" cites the *Gu Jin Zi Gu*: \"*Qin* is the modern *qin* (勤).\" Jin Zhuo’s commentary on the *Book of Han*’s \"Annals of Emperor Wen\" states: \"*Qin* is the ancient *qin* (勤).\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Qin* means slight and inferior.\" This describes its qi as *mianmian*, seemingly enduring, and in its use, not weak or diminished. Yu Xingwu states: Most earlier readings take *qin* (勤) literally, while Hong Yixuan reads *qin* (勤) in \"its use is not *qin*\" as *qin* (廑), glossing it as weak or slight.\n\nThe phrase \"its use is weak and slight\" is too extreme. *Qin* (勤) should be read as *jin* (觐). In bronze inscriptions, *qin* (勤) and *jin* (觐) are both written as *jin* (堇). The *Zongzhou Zhong* reads: \"The king began to inspect the *jin*-strengthened lands of Wen and Wu\"; the *Qi Chen Manyi* reads: \"Began to *jin* cultivate virtue\"; the *Shuai Jia Ding* reads: \"Remembering the king’s mother’s *jin* ○\"—in all these cases, *jin* (堇) should be read as *qin* (勤). The *Song Ding* reads: \"Returned to present *jin* chapters\"; the *Nü ○○* reads: \"The woman ○ *jin* served the king\"; the ○ *You* reads: \"First pacified the Yi with *jin*\"—in all these cases, *jin* (堇) should be read as *jin* (觐). The *Book of Songs*' \"Han Yi\" states: \"The Marquis of Han entered to *jin* (have audience).\" The *Zuo Tradition* of the twenty-eighth year of Duke Xi states: \"Entered and exited three *jin* (audiences).\" *Jin* means \"to see.\" \"Its use is not *jin*\" means its use is not seen. The earlier line \"seemingly enduring\" describes its subtle and wondrous *qi*, appearing to exist yet not truly existing—this precisely aligns with the meaning of \"its use is not seen,\" just as Chapter 35 states, \"Look at it, and it is not sufficient to be seen.\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang’s *Rhyme Readings* groups the following:\n*Death* and *yin* (牝) in rhyme (Zhi rhyme group, *yin* pronounced as *bi*).\n*Gate*, *root*, *enduring*, and *qin* in rhyme (Wen rhyme group).\n\nYao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen did not include *death* (死) and *yin* (牝) with the character *gate* (门) in rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Wang Niansun’s *Ancient Rhyme Tables* cites the \"Yi Benming\" chapter of the *Great Dai’s Record of Rites*, where the four lines \"The lofty are for life\" rhyme *death* (死) and *yin* (牝). Xue Hui states: The *Laozi* generally employs rhyme, thus its diction often alters words to harmonize, not to derive meaning from a single character. For instance, in this chapter, \"This is called the mysterious *yin*\" (玄牝) reads *yin* (牝) as *fou* (否) to rhyme with the preceding line. When it says \"the gate of the mysterious *yin*,\" it merely extends the phrase to rhyme with the following line. Some later interpreters, however, impose arbitrary explanations, designating a specific place as \"the gate of the mysterious *yin*,\" which is entirely mistaken.\n\nGu Yanwu says: Regarding *gu* (谷, \"valley\"), though the *Guangyun* lists two pronunciations—*yushu* (余蜀) and *gulu* (古禄)—*yu* (欲) is the proper sound. The *Yi Jing*, \"Jing\" hexagram, line nine (\"the valley shoots at the minnows\"), Lu Deming’s *Sound and Meaning* gives one pronunciation as *yu* (浴). The *Book of Documents*, \"Canon of Yao\": \"Dwelling in the eastern Yi is called Yanggu\" (旸谷), one pronunciation is *yu* (欲). The *Zuo Tradition*, Duke Xi’s thirty-second year, note: \"This road lies between the two Xiaos in the southern valley,\" one pronunciation is *yu* (欲). The *Records of the Grand Historian*, \"Biography of Fan Kuai\": \"Smashed the *xi* Hu cavalry at Henggu,\" the *Justice* states: \"*Gu* is pronounced *yu* (欲).\" The \"Biographies of Merchants\": \"Livestock reached the point of measuring horses and oxen by *gu*,\" the *Suoyin* states: \"*Gu* is pronounced *yu* (欲).\" The Han-era *Inscription for Laozi of Ku County*: \"The valley spirit does not die\" (谷神不死) writes it as \"the bathing spirit\" (浴神), which is correct. When shifted to the departing tone, it is pronounced *yu* (裕). Today, people read *gu* (谷) as *gu* (谷) and add the \"mountain\" radical to form *yu* (峪), pronouncing it *yu* (裕), which is incorrect (*Tang Yun Zheng*, entering tone, third *zhu* group).\n\nHe further states: *Yin* (牝), ancient pronunciation *fuli* (扶履) reverse. The *Laozi*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*.\" Corroborating evidence: The *Wenzi*, \"Guarding the Weak\": \"To be the *yin* of all under heaven is how the spirit does not die.\" The \"Natural\" chapter: \"All under heaven has a beginning, yet none know its principle. Only the sage knows its cause—neither female nor male, neither *mu* nor *yin*, born yet not dying\" (Scroll 8, *Shi Zhen*).\n\nJiang Yong says: *Yin* (牝) is pronounced *pili* (毗履). The *Laozi*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*.\" Now, *yin* (牝) takes its sound from *bi* (匕), yet its modern pronunciation is *piren* (毗忍), a shift in later regional phonology, like *min* (敏) becoming *meiyun* (眉陨), *zhun* (准) becoming *zhiyin* (之尹), *sun* (隼) becoming *xiyun* (息允), and *yin* (○) becoming *juyin* (居隐). Gu’s claim that the *yin* (牝) character’s sound was altered because its common usage was deemed inelegant is incorrect (*Ancient Rhyme Standards*, rising tone, second division).\n\nYan Kejun says: *Yin* (牝) is included in both the *zhi* (旨) and *zhen* (轸) rhyme groups of the *Guangyun*. Examining the *Great Dai’s* \"Yi Benming,\" where *death* (死) and *yin* (牝) harmonize, and the *Laozi*’s \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*,\" neither has shifted into the *zhen* (轸) group (*Shuowen Sound Categories*, first scroll, *zhi* group).\n\nWei Jiangong says: The six lines—*death* (死), *yin* (牝), *gate* (门), *root* (根), *enduring* (存), and *diligent* (勤)—all harmonize. The *Classic’s Exegesis and Pronunciation*: \"*Yin* (牝), *pinen* (频忍) reverse; old pronunciation *fusi* (扶死) reverse; Jianwen’s pronunciation *fujin* (扶紧) reverse.\" The old pronunciation harmonized with *death* (死), while later it was altered to harmonize with *gate* (门), *root* (根), and the other characters. Originally, they must have all harmonized completely (*Research on Ancient Phonology*, 294).\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version of this chapter contains twenty-two characters, combining from \"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible\" to this point as a single chapter. The Dunhuang version has twenty-three characters; the Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Fan Yingyuan versions have twenty-five; and the Fu Yi version has twenty-six. The Heshang Gong version titles it \"Forming Images, Sixth\"; the Wang Bi version titles it \"Chapter Six\"; and the Fan Yingyuan version titles it \"The Valley Spirit Does Not Die, Sixth.\" **Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts.**\n\nHeaven and Earth endure so long because they do not live for themselves—thus they can endure forever. Yan Kejun notes: \"For 'endure so long' (长久者), the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include an additional 'and' (且) after 'long' (长).\" Qian Zhi observes: The Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan versions concur. The Suizhou Stele reads \"Heaven and Earth endure long.\" Moreover, \"Heaven endures, Earth lasts\" was likely an ancient saying, here cited and expounded.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character \"故\" is indistinct in the stele due to erosion. For \"endure forever\" (长久), other versions read \"long life\" (长生). Yan Kejun states: \"The *Wangshi Cuibian* cites the Xingzhou version as identical to this. The Yizhou stone pillar and the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read 'long life'—this is incorrect.\" Further, the Dunhuang version and the *Jin Ji Zhan’s Yi Taiji Lun* both read \"endure forever.\" Here, the character \"久\" is likely a loan for \"有,\" differing slightly from the previous two instances of \"久.\" The *Liezi: Tianrui* states: \"The spirit is Heaven’s *you*; the Dao’s advance toward the root is not *you*.\" The commentary notes: \"Should read *you*.\" Thus, \"can endure forever\" means \"can endure and possess.\" Therefore, the sage places himself last yet comes first; sets himself aside yet endures. Qian Zhi notes: The Du Guangting version omits these two lines. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* cites \"Thus Laozi said: 'Places himself last yet comes first; sets himself aside yet endures'\"—consistent with all other versions.\n\nBy being selfless, he fulfills his self. Yan Kejun notes: \"By being selfless\" (以其无私)—the *Shiwen* cites the Heshang Gong version as identical. The *Yuzhu* and Wang Bi versions include \"非\" before \"以,\" and Wang Bi’s version ends with \"邪.\" Qian Zhi observes: Chen Bixu states: \"The Heshang Gong and Yan Junping versions read '以其无私,' while the ancient Wang Bi version reads: '不以其无私邪?' The Yan version Chen saw matches this stele. The Wang Gu version aligns with the Fu and Fan versions, as well as the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*. The Guangming, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Gao Bi, Fan Yingyuan, and Muromachi manuscript versions match the current Wang Bi version. The Suizhou Stele reads: '此其无尸，故能成其尸.'\" The *Qiang Ben Chengshu* commentary states: \"尸 means 'master'... saying 'fulfills his *shi*' concludes in praise of the sage.\" The text Cheng relied on was likely the Suizhou Stele. However, writing \"私\" as \"尸\" is incorrect. The *Hou Han Shu: Fangshu Zhuan* glosses \"尸解\" as: \"Claiming to ascend as an immortal, one feigns death to transform.\" This is Daoist immortality lore intruding into Laozi’s original text, as seen in the *Qiang Ben Chengshu* and the Suizhou Stele.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang Yong’s *Vernacular Reading*, has no rhyme. Yao Wentian: \"先 and 存 rhyme,\" as does Xi Zhao. Chen Zhu: \"生 and 生 rhyme; 先, 存, and 私 rhyme.\" The character \"私\" shifts in sound to align with \"先,\" just as \"西施\" is also written \"先施.\" Qian Zhi notes: \"长生\"’s \"生\" in the Dunhuang, Jinglong, and Suizhou versions all read \"长久,\" showing this chapter rhymes 久, 久, 久, while 生 and 生 do not rhyme. Moreover, \"不自生\"’s \"生\" enters the *geng* rhyme group, harmonizing with \"先\" and \"存\" in the *wen* group—this is *wen* and *geng* inter-rhyming.\n\nThe Jinglong Stele version of this chapter contains forty-six characters; the Dunhuang version matches it. The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan versions have forty-nine. The Heshang Gong version titles it \"Concealing Light, Seventh\"; the Wang Bi version, \"Chapter Seven\"; and the Fan Yingyuan version, \"Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts, Chapter Seven.\"\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water.**\nThe highest virtue is like water. Water benefits all things yet does not contend. Yan Kejun notes: \"Yet does not\" (又不)—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read \"而不.\" Qian Zhi observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (58) omits \"善,\" and \"万\" appears as \"万.\" \"Yet does not contend\" (又不争) is consistent in the Dunhuang, Suizhou, *Yuzhu*, Lou Zheng, Sima Guang, Cao Daochong, Qiang Siqi, Li Rong, and Muromachi versions. The Fu and Fan versions read \"而不争,\" matching the Wang Bi version.\n\nFurther, ancient Daoist discourse often likened the Dao to water. The *Guanzi: Shuidi* states: \"Earth is the root of the myriad things, the foundation of all life. Water is Earth’s blood, flowing like veins and arteries.\" It also says: \"What is water? The root of the myriad things, the ancestral hall of all life.\" This aligns with Laozi’s thought. The *Huainanzi* states: \"Of all things under Heaven, none is weaker than water, yet its greatness is boundless, its depth unfathomable. It extends endlessly, flows infinitely, waxes and wanes without measure. As rain and dew in the sky, as moisture and nourishment on Earth, it enables all things to live and all affairs to succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows blessings even on crawling insects without seeking reward, enriches the world without exhaustion, and bestows virtue upon the people without cost.\" Xue Juncai remarked that the *Huainanzi*’s exposition truly expands on \"benefits all things\"—this is evident.\n\nDwelling where the multitude □ what they detest, it nearly approaches the Dao. Qian Zhi notes: After \"人,\" other versions include \"之,\" but the stele is eroded. Lu Deming states: \"处 is also written 居.\" The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read \"处,\" while the Fu and Fan versions read \"居.\" The Dunhuang version matches this stele.\n\nThe Muromachi edition includes the character \"矣\" after \"Dao.\" Ōta Seiken states: \"几\" is read in the level tone, meaning \"near.\" The *Xici* commentary to the *Book of Changes* says: \"Heaven and Earth may nearly come to rest.\" The *Record of Ritual and Music* states: \"To understand music is to nearly approach ritual.\" The annotation explains: \"几 means near.\" The *Yu Fu* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* says: \"This nearly leads to no escape.\" The *Great Music* chapter of the *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: \"Then one nearly understands it.\" The annotation explains: \"几 means near.\" The Dao is formless, whereas water still possesses form. Thus, while water benefits all things and living beings in a visible manner, it cannot compare to the formless bestowal of the Dao. Hence, it is said to \"nearly approach the Dao.\" Modern interpreters mistakenly gloss \"几\" as \"mechanism\" or \"turning point.\"\n\nThe *Yuan Dao Xun* of the *Huainanzi* states: \"The formless is the great ancestor of all things; the soundless is the great origin of all sounds. Its child is light, its grandchild is water—both born of the formless!\" Light can be seen but not grasped; water can be followed but not destroyed. Thus, among all things with form, none is more revered than water. This serves as the annotation for \"nearly approaches the Dao\" in this chapter.\n\nDwelling in a good place, the mind abides in profound stillness, and one befriends good people.\nYan Kejun notes: \"善人\" appears as \"善仁\" in other editions, as the characters were interchangeable in ancient script.\nQian Zhi observes: The Wang Xizhi edition also writes \"人.\" The *Zai You* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: \"His dwelling is profound and still,\" with Guo Xiang’s annotation: \"Stillness can be made as deep as an abyss.\" The *Odes* in the line \"其心塞渊\" has a commentary: \"渊 means deep.\" The *Tai Xuan* states: \"闲中心渊也,\" with the annotation: \"渊 means deep.\" \"渊\" carries the sense of stillness and depth. \"The mind abides in profound stillness\" describes a mind so deep and tranquil it is unfathomable—what is meant by \"a skilled merchant conceals his wealth as if empty.\"\n\nWords are trustworthy, governance is well-ordered.\nYan Kejun notes: \"政善\" appears as \"正善\" in the Heshang Gong edition.\nJi Yun states: The *Yongle Dadian* writes \"政,\" as the characters were interchangeable in ancient usage.\nBi Yuan says: The *Yongle Dadian* writes \"政\"; those writing \"正\" are incorrect.\nQian Zhi observes: \"政\" is correct. The *Laozi* uses both \"正\" and \"政.\" In Chapter 58, \"其政闷闷，其政察察,\" \"政\" is used consistently here. The *Shiming*’s *Explanation of Language* states: \"治 means *zhi* (to govern), as all things attain their proper place.\"\n\nAffairs are skillfully managed, actions are timely.\n\nOnly by not contending does one remain without blame.\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu Yi edition includes the character *yi* (矣) after *you* (尤). The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Fan Yingyuan editions match this stone inscription.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Sheng’s *Rhyming Analysis* reads:\n*Yuan* (渊) and *xin* (信) rhyme (Zhen 部; *yuan* as 一均反, *xin* in level tone).\n*Zhi* (治), *neng* (能), and *you* (尤) rhyme (Zhi 部; *neng* as 奴其反, *you* pronounced as *yi*).\n\nYao Wentian: *Yuan* (渊), *ren* (仁), and *xin* (信) rhyme; *zhi* (治), *neng* (能), *shi* (时), and *you* (尤) rhyme.\nDeng Tingzhen concurs.\nDeng states: \"*Neng* (能) in ancient pronunciation belongs to the Zhi and Hai 部. *You* (尤) was anciently read as *yi*; in the *Book of Songs*, *zai chi* (载驰) rhymes with *zi* (子), *si* (思), and *zhi* (之).\"\nJiang Yougao says: \"*Xin* (信) is pronounced as 息晋切. According to ancient usage, it was exclusively read in the level tone; by the Han, it was occasionally read in the departing tone and should be grouped with the Zhen 部. In the *Laozi*, the *Yixing* chapter’s *shan* (善) and *xin* (信) rhyme with *yuan* (渊) and *xin* (信); the *Xuxin* chapter’s *qi zhong you xin* (其中有信) rhymes with *zhen* (真).\" (See *Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng*, 21 Zhen.)\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains fifty characters in this section. The Dunhuang edition matches the Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Fan Yingyuan editions, while the Fu Yi edition has fifty-two characters. Heshang Gong titles it \"Yixing Di Ba\" (易性第八), Wang Bi titles it \"Chapter Eight,\" and Fan Yingyuan titles it \"Shang Shan Ruo Shui Di Ba\" (上善若水第八).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nTo hold and fill it is not as good as stopping in time.\nYan Kejun notes: \"不若其以\" appears in all editions as \"不如其已,\" with the characters being interchangeable.\nQian Zhi notes: The *Book of Later Han* records Shen Tu Gang’s memorial: \"The caution against overfilling is what Laozi feared.\" \"Holding fullness\" is synonymous with \"holding abundance.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Treatise on Music*, states: \"Overflowing without reduction leads to spillage; abundance without restraint leads to collapse.\" This version’s \"持而盈之\" is superior in meaning. The *Xunzi*, *Youzuo* chapter, records: \"Confucius observed the temple of Duke Huan of Lu, where there was an unstable vessel. His disciples drew water and poured it in: when half-full, it stood upright; when full, it overturned; when empty, it tilted. Confucius sighed deeply and said, 'Alas! How can anything full not overturn?'\" This illustrates the fear of abundance’s tendency to spill—better to stop in time.\nYan Junping writes \"殖而盈之.\" Chen Bixu comments: \"This refers to accumulating wealth and treasures.\" Qian Zhi notes: This likely stems from misreading the following line, \"金玉满室，莫之能守,\" and erroneously altering the preceding text.\n\nTo sharpen and refine it cannot be preserved for long.\nYan Kejun notes: \"而锐\" appears as \"而棁\" in Wang Bi’s edition; \"长保\" appears as \"长宝\" in the Xingzhou edition.\nQian Zhi notes: \"揣而锐之\" appears as \"○而棁之\" in the Fu Yi edition and as \"○而锐之\" in Gao Miao’s edition.\nBi Yuan says: The *Shuowen Jiezi* does not include the character \"○.\" The Fu Yi edition provides a phonetic gloss for this line: \"○ is pronounced as *chuai* (揣), meaning 'to measure.'\" The meaning of \"measure\" aligns with \"揣.\" As the *Zuozhuan* states, \"揣高卑\" (\"measuring high and low\"), could \"○\" be an ancient form of \"揣\"?\nQian Zhi notes: \"揣\" is a regional term in the *Laozi*. Yang Xiong’s *Fangyan* (13) defines \"揣\" as \"to test,\" with Guo Pu’s commentary: \"揣度试之\" (\"to measure and test\"). Defining \"揣\" as \"test\" is unclear; it should be glossed as \"to break\" or \"to forge.\" Gu Huan’s annotation reads: \"to refine.\" The *Jiyun* states: \"揣 means to strike and forge.\" Both are correct. In Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* (Vol. 3), the \"揣\" character cites the ancient *Laozi* as \"○,\" and the Fu Yi edition as \"○,\" which is the ancient form of \"揣.\"\nSun Yirang says: \"○\" is a variant of \"揣,\" as recorded in the *Jiyun* (4 Zhi). However, based on the commentary’s meaning, \"揣\" should be read as \"捶\" (*chui*, \"to hammer\"). The *Jiyun* (34 Liang) lists \"○\" as a variant of \"捶,\" and the two characters were interchangeable in ancient script. Wang [Bi] states: \"既揣末令尖，锐之令利\" (\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpen it to a fine edge\"), referring to forging hooks and needles to make them sharp (Heshang Gong’s edition uses \"锐\" for \"棁\"). The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, states: \"大马之捶钩者\" (\"the great horse that hammers hooks\"). Gao You’s commentary: \"捶 means to strike and forge.\" The *Shuowen*, under the hand radical, defines \"揣\" as \"to measure; also, to hammer.\" Thus, \"揣\" and \"捶\" are phonetically related and interchangeable. Fu Yi’s emendation of \"揣\" to \"○\" does not alter the text but glosses it as \"to measure,\" which is incorrect.\nYi Shunding says: The character \"棁\" should follow Heshang Gong’s edition as \"锐.\" The *Shuowen* defines \"棁\" as \"a wooden staff,\" which cannot be the object of \"揣而棁之.\" The *Jingdian Shiwen* cites Wang Bi’s edition as \"棁\" but notes the pronunciation as \"菟夺反\" and \"徒活反.\" The *Yupian*, under the hand radical, lists \"捝\" as having two pronunciations: \"徒活切\" and \"兔夺切,\" with the *Shuowen* gloss: \"to untie.\" The wood radical’s \"棁\" appears twice, once as \"之悦切\" and once as \"朱悦切,\" with no \"菟夺\" or \"徒活\" readings. Thus, the *Shiwen*’s \"棁\" is clearly a misprint for \"捝.\" ... In reality, Wang Bi’s edition uses \"锐,\" differing from the ancient edition’s \"捝.\" The commentary states: \"既揣末令尖，又锐之令利，势必摧衄\" (\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpening it to a fine edge will inevitably lead to breakage\"), which confirms this. The *Wenzi*, *Weiming* chapter, and the *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, both use \"锐,\" in agreement.\n\nChen Qian’s note: The explanation in the *Yi* is correct. Ma Shulun states: \"Peng Song cites the *Shiwen* as having the correct character ‘捝.’ It appears that Wang Bi’s edition originally wrote ‘捝’ but read it as ‘锐.’\" Jiang Xichang remarks: \"Liu Weiyong’s *Kaoyi* notes: ‘Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi all follow the ancient edition.’ It also cites Wang Bi’s version of the text as ‘揣而锐之,’ indicating that Liu saw Wang’s edition as having ‘锐.’ Ye’s claim that Wang’s edition has ‘锐’ is thus accurate.\" Takeuchi Yoshio observes: \"‘揣而棁之’ appears in the *Heshang Gong* edition as ‘锐.’\" Examining Wang Bi’s commentary—\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpening it to a fine edge\"—it is clear that Wang took \"棁\" as a loan for \"锐,\" while the *Heshang Gong* edition uses the standard character \"锐.\"\n\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can preserve them.\nChen Qian’s note: \"Hall\" in the *Shiwen* is given as an alternate reading \"室.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"The character ‘室’ appears in the editions of Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi, all matching the ancient edition.\" Modern collation shows that the Fu edition also uses \"室,\" and \"室\" is the superior reading. The *Shuowen* defines \"室\" as \"fullness,\" while the *Shiming* explains: \"filled with people and things.\" The versions of Yan Junping and Wang Bi seen by Chen Bixu also use \"室.\" Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune.\nYan Kejun notes: \"‘而骄’ appears in the *Yu zhu* as ‘而憍.’\" Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, and Jingfu editions all write \"○,\" a variant form of \"咎.\" Chen Qian’s note: The Lou edition and Sima Guang’s edition also write \"憍\" for \"骄,\" while Gao Diao’s edition uses \"○.\" The phrase \"自遗其咎\" appears in the *Qunshu zhiyao* as \"还自遗咎\" and in the Muromachi edition as \"还自遗其咎.\" The * Yupian* defines \"咎\" as: \"The *Shuowen* states: ‘disaster, composed of 人 and 各, indicating mutual opposition.’\"\n\nWhen merit is achieved, fame attained, and the self withdrawn, this is the Dao of Heaven.\nYan Kejun notes: Wang Bi’s edition reads \"功遂、身退,\" while Fu Yi’s edition has \"成名、功遂、身退,\" and the Xingzhou edition reads \"名成、功遂、身退.\" Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, and Jingfu editions all read \"功成、名遂、身退.\" The Jingfu edition includes an additional \"也\" after \"道.\" Chen Qian’s note: The *Wenzi*, *Shangde* chapter, cites: \"功成、名遂、身退, 天道然也.\" The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, also quotes: \"故老子曰：‘功成、名遂、身退，天之道也.’\" Both include the particle \"也.\" Additionally, the \"身退\" in the Kaiyuan *Yu zhu* appears as \"身○.\" The *Zijian* states: \"○, the *Shuowen* defines as ‘to retreat, composed of 月, 从, and 从.’ The vulgar form is ‘退.’\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, as analyzed by Jiang Yong: 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme (之 and 幽 are interchangeable; 已 aligns with the *you* sound, while 保 is read as ○). Yao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen’s analysis: 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme. \"保\" in ancient pronunciation is *bu fou* cut, while \"道,\" as a rising tone, belongs to the 幽 rhyme group in ancient phonology. Chen Qian’s note: 已 is pronounced *yi* and appears in the stele edition as \"以.\" 以 belongs to the 之 rhyme group, while 保, 守, and 咎 belong to 幽, and 道 spans both 之 and 幽, forming an interchangeable rhyme. This should include the two instances of \"之\" in \"盈之\" and \"锐之,\" thus rhyming 之, 以, 之, 保, 守, 咎, and 道. Karlgren also includes \"骄\" in the rhyme with 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道. Xi Dong notes: 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme, with 之 and 尤 being interchangeable, as in the *Yi*’s *Heng* hexagram, where \"道\" rhymes with \"已\" and \"始.\" Jiang Yong’s *Guyun biaozhun* places \"保\" in the upper rising tone, eleventh division, with supporting evidence: \"永言保之\" rhymes with 寿 and 考; \"他人是保\" rhymes with 栲, 杻, 扫, and 考; \"南土是保\" rhymes with 宝 and 舅; \"王躬是保\" rhymes with 考. Collateral evidence includes Laozi’s \"揣而锐之，不可长保，金玉满堂，莫之能守.\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains forty-one characters; the Dunhuang and Fu Yi editions match this count. The *Heshang Gong* and Fan Yingyuan editions have forty characters, while Wang Bi’s edition has thirty-nine. The *Heshang Gong* titles this chapter \"运夷第九,\" Wang Bi’s edition titles it \"九章,\" and Fan’s edition titles it \"持而盈之章第九.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nCan you embrace the soul and hold fast to the One without separation?\nYan Kejun notes: \"能无离\" in Fu Yi’s edition and recent printings of Wang Bi’s edition include the particle \"乎\" at the end of this phrase, as do the following five phrases. Yu Yue observes: The *Heshang Gong* edition omits \"乎,\" as does the Tang Jinglong stele. However, the *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, quotes Laozi: \"载营魄抱一，能无离乎？专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？\" indicating that the ancient edition did include \"乎.\" Chen Qian’s note: The \"乎\" is a superfluous interpolation. Luo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, Dunhuang (versions B and C), and British Library editions all omit \"乎,\" as do the subsequent instances. Li Daochun remarks: \"The addition of ‘乎’ in ‘抱一能无离’ and the following five phrases is incorrect.\"\n\nThe initial character \"載\" (zài), according to Guo Zhongshu’s *Pei Xi* (Vol. 1): \"Thus, in the first scroll of the *Laozi*, ‘載’ was altered to ‘哉’.\" The annotation states: \"Emperor Xuanzong of Tang decreed: ‘Reverently following the sagely teachings, I have deeply pondered the profound origins. Recently, I changed the character ‘載’ in the *Daode Jing* to ‘哉’, attaching it to the preceding text. After deliberation, all agreed, and thus the true meaning was interwoven to form this commentary.’\"\n\nSun Yirang’s *Zha Yi* notes: \"The old commentaries all treat ‘天之道’ as the end of a chapter and read ‘載營魄抱一’ as a single phrase. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter and the *Qunshu Zhiyao* (Vol. 39) both include the particle ‘也’ after ‘道’, with the same chapter division. The *Chu Ci*’s *Yuanyou* states: ‘載營魄而登霞兮.’ Wang Yi’s commentary explains: ‘Embracing my spirit-soul to ascend.’ Qu Yuan seems to have borrowed from the *Laozi*. Thus, from pre-Qin and Western Han times to the present, those who interpret this text have all read it without variation. Only the *Cefu Yuangui* records Emperor Xuanzong’s decree from the fifth year of Tianbao (746): ‘Recently, I changed the character ‘載’ in the *Daode Jing* to ‘哉’, attaching it to the preceding sentence to form the commentary.’ Guo Zhongshu’s *Pei Xi* also states: ‘In the first scroll of the *Laozi*, ‘載’ was altered to ‘哉’,’ with the annotation likewise citing this decree.\n\nExamining Wang Bi’s edition of the *Daojing* (Chapter 37) and Xuanzong’s annotated edition, only Chapter Ten contains the character ‘載.’ Thus, the ‘載’ Xuanzong altered to ‘哉’ must be this instance, and he also reattached it to the preceding chapter’s ‘天之道’ as a single phrase. The stone inscription of Xuanzong’s annotated *Daode Jing* in Yizhou still reads ‘載’ in the traditional manner, as this stele was erected in the twentieth year of Kaiyuan (732). Later, a separate revision was made, hence the decree’s proclamation. Since the stele predates the revision, it retains the old interpretation.\n\nThe characters ‘載’ and ‘哉’ were interchangeable in ancient script. Though Xuanzong’s reading diverges sharply from antiquity, upon careful examination of the text and collation of the meaning, it remains plausible. The revised commentary finalized after Tianbao has not been transmitted to later generations. While the Kaiyuan edition survives in stone inscriptions, it does not align with the Tianbao decree. Modern scholars such as Bi Yuan (*Kaoyi*), Qian Daxin (*Qianyan Tang Jinshi Batail*), Wu Yi (*Shoutang Jinshi Ba*), and Wang Chang (*Jinshi Cuibian*), in their studies of the imperial commentary, have all been unable to verify this. Now, by comparing the decree with the stone edition, the traces of the alteration become clear. This is briefly recorded to preserve the variant reading.\"\n\nThe character \"抱\" appears in the Fu edition and Gao Diao’s edition as \"袌.\" Bi Yuan states: \"In all versions, '袌' is uniformly written as '抱.' According to the gloss, *bao* (袌) means 'to embrace,' while *bao* (抱) is equivalent to *pou* (捊), meaning 'to grasp'—their meanings differ, so the character '袌' should be used.\" My humble note: Bi Yuan’s argument is incorrect. The *Guangyun*, under the *hao* rhyme, defines *bao* (袌) as \"the lapel of a garment,\" and further notes: \"Now used for court robes.\" This differs entirely from the meaning of *bao* (抱). In the *Daodejing*, Chapter 42 reads, \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\" Chapter 64 has \"trees of a single embrace,\" Chapter 19 states, \"Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\" and Chapter 22 says, \"Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven\"—in all these instances, the Fu Yi edition writes *bao* (袌). Bi Yuan asserts: \"Writing '抱' for '袌' is incorrect. The commonly circulated versions, including those of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi, all use '抱.'\" It is unclear on what basis Bi Yuan makes this claim. In the *Guangyun*, the character *bao* (抱) appears above *bao* (袌), with the gloss \"a bird brooding over eggs,\" suggesting that *bao* (抱) is the proper character, its meaning superior to that of *bao* (袌).\n\nLiu Shipei comments: According to the *Suwen*’s \"Discourse on Regulating Essence,\" it says, \"Draw blood from the *ying*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Stimulating Reality\" states: \"When a person serves their spirit and harms their essence-*ying* (phrase), they become deluded and seek externally (Gao You’s note mistakenly reads *yinghui* as a single term). This is to lose one’s spirit and brightness and depart from one’s dwelling.\" The *Fayan*’s \"Cultivating the Self\" says: \"The radiant soul drifts astray, the dregs sink into oblivion.\" Here, *yingpo* (营魄) corresponds to the *ying* mentioned in the *Suwen* and *Huainanzi*, and to the \"radiant soul\" in the *Fayan*. In the *Chuci*’s \"Far-Off Journey,\" it reads, \"Carrying *yingpo* to ascend afar,\" with Wang Yi’s note: \"Embracing my spirit-soul to ascend.\" He glosses *zai* (载) as *bao* (抱) and *yingpo* as \"spirit-soul,\" following Han-dynasty exegetical tradition. \"Carrying *yingpo*\" thus means to securely hold one’s spirit. *Zai* and *bao* share the same meaning.\n\nRegarding the character \"乎\" in this passage, it should follow the Heshang Gong edition and the Jinglong stele as a later interpolation; the same applies to other instances of \"乎\" below. My humble note: While Liu’s argument is sound, glossing *yingpo* as \"spirit-soul\" seems incomplete. *Po* refers to the physical form, distinct from *hun*; thus, the *Liyun* speaks of \"body and *po*,\" and the *Jiaotesheng* of \"form and *po*.\" Moreover, *hun* is yang and *qi*, while *po* is yin and form. Gao You’s note to the *Huainanzi*’s \"Sayings on Mountains\" states: \"*Po* is the yin spirit of a person; *hun* is the yang spirit.\" Wang Yi’s note to the *Chuci*’s \"Great Summons\" says: \"*Hun* is the essence of yang; *po* is the form of yin.\" Here, *yingpo* refers specifically to yin-*po*. The *Suwen*’s \"Discourse on Regulating Essence\" says, \"Draw blood from the *ying*,\" with the note: \"*Ying* governs blood, the qi of yin.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Spirit and Essence\" states: \"Illuminating *ying* to point at heaven.\" Thus, *ying* pertains to yin; it is glossed as yin, not as \"spirit.\" \"Carrying *yingpo* and embracing the One\" means using yin-*po* to guard yang-*hun*. *Bao* (embrace) is like a hen brooding over eggs; the \"One\" is *qi*, is *hun*. To embrace the One is to use the flesh-and-blood body to guard *qi* and prevent its dissipation. In this way, form unites with spirit, *po* with *hun*. Embracing the spirit in stillness, it is said: \"Can you avoid separation?\" \"Concentrate *qi* to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"\n\nScholar Qian’s note: The Jinglun Hall edition omits the character *hu* (乎); the same applies below. The character *ying* (婴) appears as \"○,\" and its annotation likewise appears as \"○.\" The Jingfu edition concurs. For *qi* (气), Fan’s edition writes \"◯.\" After *neng* (能), the Fu Yi edition and Muromachi edition include the character *ru* (如). Furthermore, the *Huainanzi*’s \"Dao Applications\" quotes *zhi* (致) as *zhi* (至).\n\nXi Tong remarks: \"The Fu Yi edition includes *ru* (如) after *neng* (能), an interpolated character to complete the sense. The *Huainanzi*’s 'Dao Applications' includes *wu* (无) after *neng* (能), likely an interpolation influenced by the *wu* (无) in phrases such as *wu li* (无离), *wu wei* (无为), *wu ci* (无疵), and *wu zhi* (无知). The *Zhuangzi*’s 'Gengsang Chu' chapter quotes Laozi as saying, *'Can you be simple? Can you be like a child?'*—precisely parallel in structure to this passage.\"\n\nScholar Qian’s note: The character *qi* (气) embodies the naive materialist thought of China’s early philosophers. Laozi’s \"concentrating *qi*\" (*zhuan qi*) is identical to the *Guanzi*’s *Neiye*’s \"gathering *qi*\" (*tuan qi*), which states, \"Gather *qi* as if divine, and the myriad things are all preserved\" (Yin’s commentary: \"*Tuan* means to bind and accumulate\"). It further says, \"This *qi* cannot be halted by force,\" and \"When the heart is still and *qi* ordered, the Dao may be attained\"—both echoing the idea of concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness. The *Xinshu Xia* and *Neiye* both quote: *\"Can you gather *qi*? Can you unify? Can you know good and ill without divination? Can you halt? Can you cease? Can you seek nothing from others and find it within yourself?\"*—parallel to the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" passage. Moreover, the preceding line quotes \"Laozi’s *Weisheng zhi jing*,\" revealing that the *Laozi* indeed incorporates the sayings of ancient physicians. Mencius’ \"when the will is unified, *qi* moves\" (with commentary: \"When the will is single-mindedly directed, *qi* is set in motion\") likewise approximates the idea of concentrating *qi*.\n\n\"Wash and purify your profound vision—can you be without blemish?\nLove others and govern the state—can you practice non-action?\nThe gates of heaven open and close—can you remain feminine?\nComprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?\"\n\nXi Tong remarks: \"*Xuan* (玄) is borrowed for *xuan* (眩). The *Xunzi*’s 'Rectifying Theory' states, 'When superiors are secretive, inferiors grow suspicious and *xuan*,' with Yang’s commentary: '*Xuan* may be read as *xuan* (眩).' This is one example. The *Wenzi*’s 'Supreme Virtue' and the *Huainanzi*’s 'Art of Rulership' both say, 'When the heart has eyes, it is *xuan* (眩).' '*Xuan lan*' thus means deluded perception. To 'wash and purify deluded perception' is to render the heart eyeless. With no eyes, the heart becomes empty, unified, and still, unobstructed by things.\" The *Huainanzi*’s 'Vast Discourses' states, \"Thus, the eye may have *ci* (疵),\" with Gao’s commentary: \"*Ci* means superfluity.\" Yan Kejun notes: \"'Love others' appears as 'love the people' in other editions. 'Can you practice non-action' is rendered 'without knowledge' in Wang Bi’s edition. 'Can you remain feminine' appears as 'without femininity' in Heshang Gong’s edition. 'Can you act without knowledge' is rendered 'without action' in Wang Bi’s edition.\" Luo Zhenyu remarks: \"'Love the people' is written as 'love others' in the Jinglong edition to avoid taboo. After 'state,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'and act without knowledge,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and British Library editions all read 'can you practice non-action.' For 'gates of heaven,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'heaven and earth.' After 'close,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'and act,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and British Library editions all read 'can you act.' After 'comprehend,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'can you practice non-action,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, Jingfu, and British Library editions all read 'can you act without knowledge.'\" Li Qiao notes: \"'Govern the state and nurture the people'—Heshang Gong’s edition writes 'nurture' as 'bring to life,' an error. 'The gates of heaven open and close'—Cheng’s commentary states, 'Heshang Gong’s edition reads \"heaven and earth open and close.\"' 'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?'—the *Huainanzi*’s 'Dao Applications' reads, 'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without relying on knowledge?'\" Yu Yue remarks: \"According to the Tang dynasty Jinglong stele: *'Love the people and govern the state—can you practice non-action? The gates of heaven open and close—can you remain feminine? Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?*'\"\n\nAll interpretations are superior and should be followed. \"'Love the people and govern the state—can you practice non-action?'\" aligns with Confucius’ principle of \"governing through non-action.\" \"'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?'\" corresponds to the meaning of \"knowing the white yet guarding the black.\" Wang Bi’s edition erroneously inverts these. Heshang Gong’s edition renders both phrases as \"without knowledge,\" resulting in redundancy. \"'The gates of heaven open and close—can you remain without femininity?'\" is semantically incoherent, likely a corruption influenced by the surrounding lines. Wang Bi’s commentary states: \"It speaks of the gates of heaven opening and closing—can you embody femininity? Then all things will naturally submit, and your position will be secure.\" This confirms that Wang Bi’s edition correctly reads \"can you embody femininity.\" Heshang Gong’s commentary also states: \"In cultivating the self, one should emulate the feminine, remaining tranquil and yielding,\" which likewise does not read \"without femininity.\" Thus, the \"without\" is clearly a scribal error and should be corrected according to the Jinglong edition. Qian Zhi notes: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. The Jinglong edition reads \"embody femininity,\" and the Dunhuang, Fu, and Fan editions all concur. Fan Yingyuan states: \"Both Heshang Gong’s and Su Che’s commentaries read 'embody femininity'; one variant reads 'without femininity,' but this contradicts the text’s meaning. Given that the *Daodejing* contains the line 'know its masculinity yet guard its femininity,' the logic also supports 'embody femininity.'\" Now, collating stone inscriptions such as the Xing Xuan, Jingfu, Qingyang, Panxi, and Lou Zheng editions, as well as various Wang editions like the Daozang and *Collected Tang Characters* versions, all read \"embody femininity,\" consistent with the Jinglong edition. Ji Yun’s *Juzhen* edition also notes: \"Based on Wang Bi’s commentary, 'without' should read 'embody.'\" Furthermore, Liu Weiyong’s *Collected Meanings of the Daodejing* cites Wang Bi’s edition, which aligns with the Jinglong text, except that it adds an interrogative \"乎\" after every two lines.\n\n\"Giving life and nurturing, giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating—this is called profound virtue.\" Qian Zhi notes: The two lines following \"giving life yet not possessing\" are identical to those in Chapter Two. \"Relying\" in Heshang Gong’s edition appears as \"serving,\" while the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" chapter cites \"acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating,\" matching this passage. Gu’s *Cheng* commentary states: \"Thus, in acting for the benefit of things, there is no deliberate effort to rely upon.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Great Master* commentary also reads: \"Acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating—how could one assert dominance over achievements or seek precedence over others?\" This confirms that Gu’s edition likewise reads \"relying.\" The phrase \"this is called profound virtue\" appears three times in the text; the four lines following \"giving life yet not possessing\" in Chapter Fifty-One are identical to this passage. Chapter Sixty-Five’s \"constantly knowing the model—this is called profound virtue\" is glossed by Xi Dong as: \"'Profound virtue' is akin to 'ultimate virtue,' and because it is deep and far-reaching, it is called 'profound.'\" This is likely an expression of admiration, hence the repetition is not avoided.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Rhyming Readings* groups the following rhymes: *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *wéi* (為), *cī* (雌), and *zhī* (知) (with *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes in communication; *lí* 離 rhymes with *lí* 黎, and *wéi* 為 rhymes with *wéi* 惟). *Yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), and *zǎi* (宰) rhyme (in the *zhī* 之 rhyme group; *zǎi* 宰 is pronounced *zǐ* 梓). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen group *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *zhī* (知), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知) as rhymes. Qian Zhi notes: *lí* (離) and *wéi* (為) belong to the *gē* 歌 rhyme group, while *ér* (兒), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知) belong to the *zhī* 支 rhyme group; *wéi* 為 has the ancient pronunciation *yí* 怡, demonstrating communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes. Additionally, *yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), *zǎi* (宰), and *dé* (德) form a rhyme. Xi Dong and Gao Bengshan concur. Chen Zhu groups *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *zhī* (知), *cí* (雌), *wéi* (為), *zhī* (之), *yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), *zǎi* (宰), and *dé* (德) as rhymes, suggesting not only communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 but also between *zhī* 之 and *zhī* 支. Chapter Twenty-Eight’s *cí* (雌), *xī* (溪), *lí* (離), and *ér* (兒) also demonstrate communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes. Zhang Geng’s *Rhyming Discoveries* *General Principles* states: \"Among the Chu people, *gē* 歌 and *gē* 戈 shift to *zhī* 支, while in the Jiang-Huai region, *hán* 寒 and *huán* 桓 shift to *gē* 歌—these are systemic phonetic evolutions that cannot be altered.\" This confirms that the *Laozi* preserves many Chu dialectal pronunciations. Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Rhyme Corrections*, Volume Twenty-Five, *zhī* 支, notes: *lí* (離) has the ancient pronunciation *luó* 羅, citing this chapter of the *Laozi* and Chapter Twenty-Eight. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Horse Hooves\" chapter states: \"In harmony with non-knowing, one’s virtue does not depart,\" and the \"In the World\" chapter states: \"If one knows it, this is departure from it.\" Only then do *lí* (離) and *wéi* (為) rhyme with *zhī* (知). Jiang Yong’s *Ancient Rhyme Standards*, Level Tone, Second Division, discusses this: \"For example, the *Lesser Minister of Fate* chapter states: 'Sorrow is no sorrow than parting at birth, joy is no joy than new acquaintance.' Gu [Yanwu] misinterprets this, claiming the first line does not rhyme. Yet the *Laozi* rhymes *lí* (離) with *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *cí* (雌), *zhī* (知), and *xī* (溪), and the *Zhuangzi* twice rhymes *lí* (離) with *zhī* (知)—these are clear examples. If Laozi and Zhuangzi both alter the pronunciation of *lí* (離), would Qu Yuan’s use of *lí* (離) necessarily retain the sound *luó* 羅?\" Zhang Geng’s *Rhyming Discoveries*, First Category, cites this and adds: \"Jiang Yong’s example of *lí* (離) rhyming in the *Lesser Minister of Fate* should follow the Chu dialect. Laozi and Zhuangzi were both from Chu, hence their alignment with Chu phonology—all rhymes should be read with such distinctions.\" Deng Tingzhen states: The rhymes in this chapter exhibit considerable variation. *Lí* (離) was anciently read as *luó* 羅. The *Book of Songs*’ \"New Tower\" rhymes with *shī* 施, where *shī* 施 has the ancient pronunciation *tuō* 它; the *Yijing*’s *lí* 離 hexagram, third line, rhymes with *gē* 歌 and *jiē* 嗟, where *jiē* 嗟 has the ancient pronunciation *cuō* 磋. There is no precedent for rhyming with *zhī* 支 or *zhī* 脂 division characters. Yet this chapter rhymes with *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知), where *cī* (疵) and *cí* (雌) share this sound, classified under the *zhī* 脂 rhyme group.\n\nThe *Book of Songs*’ \"New Tower\" rhymes *cǐ* 泚 with *mí* 弥, and \"Chariot Attack\" rhymes *chái* 柴 with *cì* 佽—both *cǐ* 泚 and *chái* 柴 share this sound. Yet this chapter rhymes *lí* 離 with *ér* 兒 and *zhī* 知, where *ér* 兒 and *zhī* 知 both belong to the *zhī* 支 rhyme group. The character *zhī* 知 appears six times in the *Book of Songs*, always rhyming with *zhī* 支, *xī* 觿, *zhī* 枝, *jì* 伎, *chí* 箎, and the like, whereas this chapter rhymes it with *lí* 離, *cī* 疵, and *cí* 雌, all inconsistent with the *Three Hundred Poems*. Only in \"Lesser Grief\" does \"尚求其雌\" rhyme *cí* 雌 with *jì* 伎, *zhī* 枝, and *zhī* 知, already a shift due to phonetic proximity—thus rhyming *cī* 疵, *cí* 雌, and *zhī* 知 may be justified. Furthermore, in \"能无知乎,\" *zhī* 知 appears in one version as *wéi* 為, where *wéi* 為’s ancient pronunciation *é* 訛 aligns precisely with the *lí* 離 rhyme. Hence the version reading *wéi* 為 is correct, while the one with *zhī* 知 may be a scribal error.\n\nAdditionally, Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Rhymes Corrected*, juan fourteen, notes: \"有 has the ancient pronunciation *yǐ* 以.\" He cites the *Laozi*:\n\"Born yet not possessed, acting yet not reliant, growing yet not dominating.\"\n\"Grasping the ancient Dao to steer the present *yǒu* 有—knowing the ancient beginning is called the Dao’s discipline.\"\n\"Once the name is possessed, one must also know restraint; knowing restraint ensures no peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.\"\n\"Rejecting craft and profit, thieves and bandits vanish.\"\n\"When people abound in skill and cunning, rare goods proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and bandits abound.\"\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele version contains sixty-three characters here; the Dunhuang and *Heshang* versions match this count, while the Wang Bi version has sixty-nine, and the Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan versions seventy-two. The *Heshang* version titles this section \"Neng Wei, Chapter Ten,\" the Wang Bi version \"Chapter Ten,\" and the Fan Yingyuan version \"Zai Ying Po, Chapter Ten.\"\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n\"Thirty spokes share one hub—where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\"\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang versions (乙 and 丙), *Jinglong*, and *Guangming* editions all write \"卅\" (thirty). Qian Zhi observes: The *Jinglong* writes \"三十\" (thirty), while the Dunhuang and *Guangming* write \"卅\"—Luo’s collation is incorrect. The *Shitoku* edition also writes \"卅.\" Wu Yun states: \"卅 appears in all other versions as '三十.'\" This is correct. The *Yupian* glosses: \"卅, pronounced *xiān hé*, means thirty.\" Additionally, the character \"辐\" (spoke) may originally have been written as \"輹.\" The *Yi Xiaoxu*’s *Shiwen* notes: \"'辐' was originally written as '輹.'\" The *Shuowen* cites it as \"輹.\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* lists the character \"輹,\" quoting the ancient *Laozi* without the character \"辐.\" Bi Yuan states: All versions punctuate after \"当其无\" (\"where there is nothing\"). However, the *Kaogong Ji* reads: \"For ease of turning, the use lies in having nothing\"—thus, the sentence should end after \"有\" (\"there is\"). The same applies below. Yang Shuda remarks: \"'无有' ('nothing') forms a complete phrase; '车之用' ('the use of the cart') is incomplete. Bi’s interpretation may be considered.\" Qian Den states: The *Kaogong Ji* says: \"A wheel has thirty spokes, symbolizing the sun and moon.\" The sun and moon meet every thirty days, and the number of spokes mirrors this. It also states: \"Where the spokes converge is called the hub.\" The *Laozi* likewise says: \"Thirty spokes share one hub—where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\" The *Heshang Gong* explains: \"'Nothing' refers to the empty space.\" Thus, the *Kaogong Ji* commentary also states: \"For ease of turning, the use lies in having nothing.\" The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines: \"Hub: where the spokes converge.\" This means the hub’s exterior is where the spokes meet, while its hollow center accommodates the axle, enabling its use for turning (see *Che Zhi Kao* in *Qing Jingjie Xubian*, juan 216).\n\n\"Clay is kneaded to form a vessel—where there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\"\n\nJi Yun notes: All versions write \"埏,\" except the *Shiwen*, which gives \"挻.\" Luo Zhenyu states: Modern editions write \"埏,\" but the *Shiwen* includes \"挻,\" indicating Wang Bi’s version originally wrote \"挻.\" This is now corrected accordingly. The *Yuzhu* edition matches this. The *Jinglong* and Dunhuang (丙) versions write \"埏.\" Ma Xulun argues: The *Shuowen* lacks the character \"埏,\" so it should follow Wang Bi’s \"挻.\" Qian Zhi counters: \"埏\" and \"挻\" share the same meaning; no character change is necessary. The *Shuowen* defines: \"挻: to lengthen, from the hand and *yan* (extend).\" The *Zilin* states: \"'挻' means softness; today, it is written as '揉' (to knead).\" Zhu Junsheng explains: \"Any pliable material that can be stretched, shortened, bent, joined, shaped square or round is called *挻*.\" Wang Niansun adds: \"'挻' also means to harmonize. The *Laozi* reads: '挻埴以为器' ('knead clay to make vessels'). The *Heshang Gong* says: \"'挻' means to harmonize; '埴' is clay. To harmonize clay for making vessels for food and drink.\" The *Taixuan Xuanwen* states: \"With yin and yang, it harmonizes their transformations.\" Xiao Gai’s *Hanshu Xuzhuan Yinyi*, citing Shou Zhong’s commentary, says: \"'挻' means to harmonize.\" The *Huainanzi Jing Shen* reads: \"Like a potter kneading clay.\" Xiao Gai cites Xu Shen’s commentary: \"'挻' means to knead.\" The *Qice* records: \"The peach-wood figurine said to the clay effigy: 'You are soil from the west bank, kneaded into human form.'\" Gao You explains: \"'挻' means to shape.\" This meaning aligns with \"harmonize.\" From the above, \"挻\" carries the sense of kneading, but the received text consistently writes \"埏.\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* quotes the ancient *Laozi* as \"埏○,\" while the *Wenxuan Xizheng* and *Changdi Fu* commentaries cite it as \"埏.\" The *Xunzi Xing E* states: \"The potter kneads clay to make vessels,\" and later: \"The potter kneads clay to produce tiles.\" The commentary notes: \"'埏' is pronounced *shān*, meaning to strike; '埴' is sticky clay.\" The *Zhuangzi Ma Ti* reads: \"The potter said: 'I am skilled at working clay.'\" Cui (commentator) explains: \"Clay.\" Sima (commentator) adds: \"Clay suitable for making pottery.\" The meaning aligns with the *Laozi*, so this reading should be retained.\n\n\"Doors and windows are cut to form a room—where there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\"\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Jinglong* stele version concludes the chapter here.\n\n\"Thus, having gives advantage; nothingness gives use.\"\n\nYan Kejun states: All versions include the word \"故\" (\"thus\") at the start of this line. Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, Dunhuang (乙 and 丙) versions all omit \"故.\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang’s *Rhyming Analysis*, contains no rhymes. Gao Benhan: \"辐\" (spoke) and \"毂\" (hub) rhyme. Note from the *Shiwen*: \"'辐' is pronounced *fú*, a cart spoke. '毂' is pronounced *gǔ*, a cart hub.\" Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, lower even tone, *ma* rhyme: \"'车' (cart) was anciently pronounced *jū*. Wang Yinglin states: 'The ancient pronunciation of \"车\" was *jū*; the *Shuowen* first introduced the *chēzhē* reading, which became the standard from the Han onward.' Lu’s *Shiwen*, citing Wei Zhao, claims: 'Anciently, all readings were *chēzhē*; the *jū* pronunciation emerged only in the Later Han.' This is incorrect.\"\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele version of this chapter comprises two lines and forty-eight characters; the Dunhuang version, forty-seven characters; the *Heshang Gong*, Wang Bi, Fu [Yi], and Fan [Zhen] versions, forty-nine characters. The *Heshang Gong* edition titles it \"Uselessness Eleventh,\" the Wang Bi edition \"Chapter Eleven,\" and the Fan edition \"Thirty Spokes Chapter Eleventh.\"\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\nThe five tones deafen the ears;\nThe five flavors ruin the palate;\nRacing and hunting madden the mind;\nRare goods impede conduct.\nThus the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes.\nTherefore, discard that and take this.\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Mouzi Lihuo Lun* cites the first two lines identically, and the *Wen Xuan* commentary on \"Seven Exhortations\" cites the second line likewise. The *Qi Fa* commentary cites: \"The five flavors spoil the palate.\" The *Zuozhuan* commentary on Duke Zhao’s twenty-fifth year reads: \"The five flavors make the mouth foul; the five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears.\" The phrasing differs slightly. The *Zhuangzi*, \"Heaven and Earth,\" states: \"There are five ways to lose one’s nature: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, making them unhearing; third, the five odors choke the nose, congesting the sinuses; fourth, the five flavors muddy the mouth, making it diseased and spoiled; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making the nature flighty. These five are all harms to life.\" The *Huainanzi*, \"Spiritual Training,\" states: \"The five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds deafen the ears, making them unhearing; the five flavors confuse the mouth, making it spoiled and injured; preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making conduct flighty. These four are what the world uses to nourish nature, yet they are all human burdens.\" The meaning of these passages all derives from this chapter.\n\nXi Tong says: The *Guangya*, \"Explanation of Terms III,\" states: \"爽 means ruin.\" The *Chu Ci*, \"Summoning the Soul,\" reads: \"Foul and not spoiled,\" with Wang Yi’s commentary: \"In Chu, spoiled broth is called *爽*.\" Anciently, *爽* was a specific term for oral ailments, as in the *Liezi*, \"Confucius\": \"One whose mouth is about to be spoiled first distinguishes between *zi* and *mian*.\" The *Zhuangzi*, \"Heaven and Earth,\" states: \"The five flavors muddy the mouth, making it diseased and spoiled.\" The *Huainanzi*, \"Spiritual Training,\" states: \"The five flavors confuse the mouth, making it spoiled and injured.\" It is suspected that *爽* is a loan for ○, extending from the sense of loss to ruin and injury.\n\nYu Xingwu says: The characters *爽* and *丧* were anciently interchangeable in sound and meaning. In the *Book of Documents*, \"The Prince of Mi\": \"The king was in Zhou at dawn,\" where *昧* is *丧*, and *昧丧* means *昧爽*. The *Book of Songs*, \"August\": \"Receiving blessings without loss,\" means receiving blessings without *爽*. \"The five flavors make the mouth lose\" means the five flavors cause one to lose the mouth’s natural state. The *Heshang Gong* glosses *丧* as \"loss,\" which aligns perfectly with the meaning.\n\n\"Racing and hunting madden the mind\": Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yongle Dadian* reads *畋* (hunting), while the *Daoist Canon* reads *田* (field). The *Jinglong*, *Jingfu*, Dunhuang (乙 and 丙), and *Imperial Commentary* versions all read *田*. The *Songshu*, Xie Lingyun’s \"Rhapsody on Dwelling in the Mountains,\" and the *Wen Xuan* commentary on \"Seven Exhortations\" cite *田*, matching this stele. *田* is a loan for *畋*. The *Shuowen* commentary by Duan Yucai states: \"*田* is the *畋* character.\" The *Book of Changes*, \"The Army\": \"There are birds in the field,\" and the *Zhouli*, \"Field Steward\": \"For hunting and border patrols,\" with commentary: \"Hunting.\" Luo further notes: The Dunhuang versions both read *獦*, a variant of *猎* (hunting). In Luo’s scroll 乙, it appears as ○, and in 丙 as ○, as mentioned in the *Yanshi Jiaxun*, \"Evidence from Writing\": \"猎 transformed into *獦*.\" Jia Yi’s *Xinshu*, \"Lowly Position\": \"Not hunting fierce beasts but hunting field boars... is what one hunts not too small?\" Here, *獦* is a variant of *猎*.\n\nMa Qichang says: \"*行妨* (impeding conduct) means impeding agricultural affairs.\" From this, it is evident that Laozi was the progenitor of the Chinese agrarian school.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang’s *Rhyming Analysis*: *盲* (blind), *聋* (deaf), *爽* (spoiled), *狂* (mad), and *妨* (impede) rhyme (Yang and Dong rhymes intermingling; *盲* pronounced *máng*, *聋* harmonized as *láng*, *爽* in level tone). *腹* (belly) and *目* (eye) rhyme (You group). Yao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen omitted *聋*, which is incorrect. Moreover, *盲* and *聋* belong to the Dong group, while *爽*, *狂*, and *妨* belong to the Yang group—this is Dong and Yang intermingling rhyme. Yao Wentian states: \"*聋* shifts from Dong.\" Xi Tong says: \"The ancient sounds of the Dong and Yang groups were close.\" Wu Yu’s *Rhyming Supplement*, Yang ten: \"*聋*, *lúhuáng* cut, ear disease. *Yi Lin*: 'Cotton plugs the ears, making the lord dark and deaf.'\" It also cites this chapter of the *Laozi*: \"*盲* pronounced *máng*. *爽* pronounced *shuāng*.\" Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, scroll fifty-two, Geng: \"*盲*, anciently pronounced *wǔláng* cut,\" citing this chapter of the *Laozi* and noting: \"Only *聋* does not rhyme.\" Jiang Yong’s *Ancient Rhyme Standards*, level tone, first group: \"*聋*, *lúhóng* cut. *Stratagems of the Warring States*, Su Qin’s speech: 'Tongue worn, ears deaf, yet no success.' *Lüshi Chunqiu*: 'How does one know they are deaf?'\"\n\n\"Because of the ear’s acuity.’ Now, *lóng* (‘deaf’) is here taken as the standard pronunciation. In the *Laozi*’s four phrases—‘The five colors blind the eye’—*lóng* enters the Yang rhyme group. Gu Yanwu’s claim that *lóng* does not rhyme is incorrect. Even today, some regional pronunciations retain traces of this.\"\n\nWang Niansun states: \"The character *shuǎng* (‘dull’) was anciently read like *shuāng* (‘frost’), precisely rhyming with *míng* (‘bright’), *cōng* (‘acute’), and *yáng* (‘soaring’). Thus, in the *Laozi*’s ‘The five flavors dull the mouth,’ it also rhymes with *máng* (‘blind’), *lóng* (‘deaf’), *kuáng* (‘mad’), and *fáng* (‘obstruct’). The *Zhuangzi*’s ‘Heaven and Earth’ chapter—‘The five colors confuse the eye, making it unclear; the five sounds confuse the ear, making it inacute; the five flavors muddle the mouth, making it dull; preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making the nature flighty’—is the source of the *Huainanzi*’s passage (*Reading Notes*, scroll nine).\"\n\nJiang Yougao says: \"*Shuǎng* is pronounced *shū liǎng* cut. Originally, it was only read in the level tone; not until Cao Zhi’s *Releasing Sorrow*—‘Confusing my emotional *shuǎng*’—did it rhyme with *zhǎng* and *dǎng* in the rising tone. It should be included in the Yang group. In the *Laozi*’s ‘Inspecting Desires’ chapter, ‘The five flavors dull the mouth’ rhymes with *lóng* and *kuáng* (*Tang Rhymes Four Tones Correct*, thirty-six Yang).\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"The Yang and Dong sounds are close, so Yang can rhyme with Dong. In the *Odes*, *gōng* (‘merit’), *jiāng* (‘boundary’), *bāng* (‘state’), and *gōng* (‘achievement’) share rhymes; in the *Laozi*, *lóng* (‘deaf’), *máng* (‘blind’), *shuǎng* (‘dull’), and *kuáng* (‘mad’) share rhymes; in the *Divination* chapter, *cháng* (‘long’), *míng* (‘bright’), and *tōng* (‘penetrating’) share rhymes—this is the interconnection of Dong and Yang (*Shuowen Sound Categories*, lower Yang section).\"\n\nZhang Binglin says: \"Examples of Yang shifting to Dong include the *Laozi*’s rhyming of *máng* (‘blind’), *shuǎng* (‘dull’), and *kuáng* (‘mad’) with *lóng* (‘deaf’) (*National Heritage Critique*, *Philological Records*).\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains forty-nine characters; the Dunhuang, Heshang, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan versions are identical. The Heshang version titles this ‘Inspecting Desires, Twelve’; the Wang Bi version, ‘Chapter Twelve’; and the Fan version, ‘The Five Colors, Twelve.’\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n\"Favor and disgrace are like alarm; value great calamity as you do your body. What is meant by ‘favor and disgrace’? Disgrace is inferior.\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Disgrace is inferior’—Wang Bi and Fu Yi read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is inferior.’\"\n\nLuo Zhenyu says: \"The Heshang, Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, Jingfu, and Dunhuang Bing versions all omit the two characters *ruò jīng* (‘as alarm’). The Jinglong version reads ‘disgrace is inferior’; the Jingfu version reads ‘favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’\"\n\nLi Daochun says: \"‘Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior’—some versions read ‘favor is inferior,’ which contradicts the text’s meaning.\"\n\nYu Yue says: \"The Heshang Gong version reads: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Disgrace is inferior.’ The commentary states: ‘Disgrace is inferior.’ I suspect both versions contain omissions. It should read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’ When Heshang Gong wrote his commentary, the upper phrase was not yet missing, and there must have been a corresponding note. A later copyist lost the upper phrase and thus also lost the commentary.\"\n\nChen Jingyuan and Li Daochun’s versions both read: \"What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.\" This can be used to correct the errors in other versions.\n\nLao Jian says: \"‘Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior’—the Jingfu version reads thus. Fu Yi, Fan Yingyuan, and the Kaiyuan-era Wang Bi versions all read ‘favor is inferior’ as a single phrase; the Jinglong and Heshang versions read ‘disgrace is inferior’ as a single phrase. Comparing these with the Jingfu version reveals that both are incomplete. The *Daoist Canon*, Chen Jingyuan, Li Daochun, and Kou Caizhi versions all follow the Jingfu version, also reading two phrases.\"\n\nChen [Jingyuan] says: \"The Heshang version originally read ‘favor is superior, disgrace is inferior,’ which fully accords with the text’s meaning and avoids circuitousness. Thus, the ancient Heshang version did not originally omit the upper phrase.\"\n\nNow, *chǒng rǔ* (‘favor and disgrace’) refers to the perception of favor and disgrace; *wéi shàng* (‘being superior’) and *wéi xià* (‘being inferior’) are like Chapter Sixty-One’s ‘through its stillness it is inferior’ and ‘the greater should be inferior’—all refer to the perception of inferiority. This means that regarding superiority as favor and inferiority as disgrace, both gain and loss stir the heart, and the alarm is equal. If one follows the incomplete version reading ‘favor is inferior’ and interprets it as the recipient of favor being inferior, thus alarm at gain resembling alarm at loss, this misses the point. The version reading ‘disgrace is inferior’ is even more untenable.\"\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio says: \"The old manuscript Heshang version reads: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’ The various Wang Bi versions read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is inferior.’ However, Lu Deming only notes that ‘the Heshang version omits the two characters *ruò jīng*.’ In the current Wang Bi version, between the characters *chǒng* (‘favor’) and *wéi* (‘is’), three characters—*wéi shàng rǔ* (‘is superior, disgrace’)—are missing. The Heshang version seems to omit *ruò jīng* (‘as alarm’). Originally, the Wang Bi and Heshang versions were identical; later, the Heshang version lost *ruò jīng*, and the Wang Bi version lost *wéi shàng rǔ*. Subsequent collation of these two erroneous versions produced various discrepancies.\"\n\n\"Gain it as alarm, lose it as alarm—this is called favor and disgrace as alarm.\"\n\nXi Jian says: \"Wu Cheng’s version omits the six characters *shì wèi chǒng rǔ ruò jīng* (‘this is called favor and disgrace as alarm’); by the example of the following text, this seems correct.\"\n\nQian Jian notes: \"Lin Xiwen’s version also omits these six characters. Additionally, *jīng* (‘alarm’) is borrowed for *jǐng* (‘vigilance’).\"\n\n\"In the phrase *'shocking a hundred li'* (震驚百里), Zheng's commentary states: *'Jing* (驚) means vigilance and caution.' What does it mean to value great suffering as one values the body? The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body. If I were without a body, what suffering would I have?\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"In *'have great suffering'* (有大患), all versions include the character *zhě* (者) at the end of the sentence; the two *wǒ* (我) characters are written as *wú* (吾) in all versions.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: \"The Jinglong and Dunhuang (Version C) texts both omit *zhě* (者). The two *wú* (吾) characters appear as *wǒ* (我) in the Jinglong and Dunhuang (Versions B and C) texts.\" Qian Jian observes: \"The character *jí* (及) is written as *gǒu* (苟) in the Fu and Fan versions.\" Fan states: \"The character *gǒu* (苟) aligns with the ancient versions of Ying Jifu and Sima Guang.\" *Jí* (及) shares the same meaning as *ruò* (若). Wang Niansun says: \"*Jí* (及) means *ruò* (若)... Laozi states: *'The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body; if I were without a body, what suffering would I have!'* This means *if I were without a body*. It also says: *'To take the world, one always does so through non-action; if there is action, it is insufficient to take the world.'* This means *if there is action*. *Jí* (及) and *ruò* (若) share the same meaning, so *jí* (及) can be glossed as *ruò* (若), and *ruò* (若) can also be glossed as *jí* (及).\" (From *Jingzhuan Shici*) Now, comparing with ancient versions, we see that *jí* (及) and *ruò* (若) are equivalent, and *jí* (及) can also be used interchangeably with *gǒu* (苟). Additionally, in the Muromachi version, a *hū* (乎) character appears after *huàn* (患).\n\nThus, one who values their body above all in the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.\n\nYan Kejun says: \"In *'Thus, value the body for the world'* (故貴身於天下), the Imperial Commentary reads *'Thus, value the body as the world'* (故貴以身為天下), matching Wang Bi’s version, while the Heshang version reads *'Thus, value the body as the world'* (故貴以身為天下者). *'May be entrusted with the world'* (若可托天下) appears as *'may be entrusted to govern the world'* (若可寄天下) in the Imperial Commentary and Wang Bi, as *'then may be entrusted to govern the world'* (則可寄於天下) in the Heshang version, and as *'then may be entrusted to govern the world'* (則可以寄天下) in the *Yongle Dadian*. *'May be entrusted to govern the world'* (若可寄天下) appears as *'then may be entrusted with the world'* (乃可以托於天下) in the Heshang version, as *'may be entrusted with the world'* (若可托天下) in Wang Bi, and as *'then may be entrusted with the world'* (乃可以托天下) in the *Dadian*.\"\n\nLiu Wendian says: \"In the *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter): *'Thus, one who values their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.'* The phrase *'body for the sake of the world'* (身於為天下) is semantically incoherent; the two *yú* (於) characters likely belong after *'entrusted'* (托) and *'govern'* (寄). The *Daodejing* (*Disgrace and Dread*, Chapter 13) reads: *'Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.'* The *Huainanzi* (*Daoist Applications* chapter) quotes Laozi as: *'One who values their body as the world cannot be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world cannot be entrusted to govern it.'* Neither instance includes *yú* (於) after the two *shēn* (身) characters.\"\n\nQian Jian observes: Liu’s argument is incorrect. While the various versions of this passage differ, the *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter) states: *\"Thus, when a noble person must reluctantly govern the world, nothing is better than non-action; through non-action, they may then secure their nature and destiny. Thus, one who values their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.\"* Here, *yú* (於) follows both *shēn* (身) characters, and *'entrusted with the world'* (托天下) precedes *'entrusted to govern the world'* (寄天下), aligning with the Jinglong, Suzhou, and Dunhuang versions. However, the upper sentence includes an extra *wéi* (為) character, and the lower sentence includes an extra *yú* (於) character.\n\nWang Niansun says: The *Zhuangzi* originally read: *\"Thus, one who values their body for the world, one who cherishes their body for the world.\"* Here, *yú* (於) means *wéi* (為). Later readers glossed *wéi* (為) in the *Laozi* and mistakenly inserted it into the main text. The *Laozi* *Shiwen* reads: *\"Wéi (為), pronounced *yúwěi*.\"* This gloss does not include *wéi* (為), which clarifies the matter.\n\nWang Yinzhi says: *Yú* (於) means *wéi* (為) (here, *wéi* is read in the fourth tone). The *Laozi* states: *\"Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.\"* The *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter) reads: *\"Thus, one who values their body for the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the world may be entrusted to govern it.\"* Here, *'for the world'* (於天下) means *'as the world'* (為天下).\n\nQian Jian observes: The two Wangs’ arguments are correct. *Yú* (於) and *wéi* (為) are interchangeable. In the *Zhuangzi*, the upper sentence uses *'for the world'* (於天下), while the lower sentence uses *'as the world'* (為天下), matching the stele version exactly. The Fu and Fan versions read: *\"Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* Fan’s commentary notes *\"ancient version\"* (古本), and Chen Bixu’s citation of Wang Bi’s version aligns with Fu and Fan, suggesting this was also Wang’s ancient version.\n\nIn the *Daoist Canon*, the Song-era compilation *Collected Commentaries of Four Masters on Laozi*, citing Wang Bi, states: *\"Nothing can replace one’s body, hence it is called 'valuing.' Only thus may one be entrusted with the world. Nothing can harm one’s body, hence it is called 'cherishing.' Only thus may one be entrusted to govern the world.\"*\n\nThe sequence *\"entrusted with the world\"* (托天下) also precedes *\"entrusted to govern the world\"* (寄天下). The Suizhou edition reads: *\"Thus, one who values their body over the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body over the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* The two Dunhuang editions read: *\"Thus, one who values their body over the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* Most versions align broadly with the *Zhuangzi*, though the Dunhuang edition is superior and should be adopted for emendation. Furthermore, these two instances of *\"ruo\"* (若) are synonymous with *\"ze\"* (则). Wang Yinzhi states: *\"'Ruo' means 'ze.' Laozi says: 'Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.' In the *Zhuangzi*'s 'In the World of Men' chapter, 'ruo' is uniformly written as 'ze.'\" Today, the Heshang and Dayian editions also use \"ze,\" confirming this point. Additionally, *\"cherishes their body\"* (爱以身) appears in the Guangming and Jingfu editions as *\"cherishes their body to\"* (爱身以). Wu Yun’s *Jinshi Ji of the Two Hundred Orchid Pavilion Studio* erroneously emends the Guangming edition to read *\"cherishes their body and as the world\"* (爱以身与为天下者), aligning with the Jinglong edition. Moreover, *\"as the world\"* (为天下者), Luo Zhenyu’s *Textual Criticism of the Daodejing* mistakenly emends the Jinglong edition’s *\"zhe\"* (者) to *\"yi\"* (矣), and Jiang Xichang perpetuates this error. This single example suffices to illustrate the difficulty of textual collation.\n\nFurthermore, the *Zhuangzi*'s \"Giving Away a Throne\" chapter states: *\"The world is weighty indeed, yet it does not harm one’s life—how much less other things? Only one who does not treat the world as their own may be entrusted with the world.\"* The *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s \"Valuing Impartiality\" chapter likewise says: *\"The world is a weighty thing, yet it does not harm one’s life—how much less other things? Only one who does not harm their life for the world may be entrusted with the world.\"* Both passages derive their meaning from this chapter.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nJiang Yong’s *Rhyming Analysis* finds no rhyme in this chapter. Karlgren pairs *\"shen\"* (身) and *\"huan\"* (患) as rhymes, though this is incorrect. Chen Zhu argues that the five *\"jing\"* (惊) characters, three *\"shen\"* (身) characters, and four *\"xia\"* (下) characters form rhymes. Yang Shuda counters: *\"The preceding text's 'shen' and 'jing' belong to separate sections and need not be forced into rhyme.\"*\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains seventy-eight characters; the Dunhuang edition matches it. The Wang edition has eighty-one characters, the Heshang edition eighty-four, the Fan edition eighty-five, and the Fu edition eighty-eight. The Heshang edition titles this chapter *\"Disdaining Shame, Thirteen\"* (厌耻第十三), the Wang edition *\"Chapter Thirteen\"* (十三章), and the Fan edition *\"The Chapter on Favor and Disgrace\"* (宠辱章第十三).\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n*\"Look at it and it cannot be seen—it is called 'subtle' (夷);\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called 'rare' (希).\"*\nQian notes: The Fan edition writes *\"yi\"* (夷) as *\"ji\"* (几). Fan Yingyuan states: *\"The character 'ji' is found in Sun Deng’s and Wang Bi’s ancient editions. Fu Yi says: 'Ji means hidden and without form.'\"* This citation of Fu confirms that Fu’s edition was later altered; the ancient edition also used *\"ji.\"* The character *\"ji\"* is correct and aligns with the *Yijing*'s meaning. The *Yijing*’s *Appended Judgments* speaks of *\"probing the profound and investigating the subtle\"* (极深研几) and *\"knowing the subtle is divine\"* (知几其神), where *\"ji\"* refers to *\"the incipient movement, the first sign of good fortune\"* (动之微，吉之先见者). Zheng Xuan’s commentary defines *\"ji\"* as *\"subtle\"* (微), matching Fu’s explanation. Ma Xulun argues that the cursive script for *\"ji\"* resembles that for *\"yi,\"* and their pronunciations are close, leading to the corruption of *\"ji\"* into *\"yi.\"*\n\n*\"Grasp it and it cannot be held—it is called 'elusive' (微).\"*\nQian notes: The Wang edition writes *\"tuan\"* (抟) as *\"bo\"* (搏). The *Exegesis* reads: *\"'Bo' is pronounced 'bo'; Jianwen reads it as 'boge.'\" The Suizhou and Dunhuang editions both erroneously write *\"bo.\"* Yi Shunding states: *\"'Bo' is a corruption of 'tuan.' 'Tuan' appears in the *Huainanzi*'s 'Stimulating Reality' chapter as 'tuan yuan gang rou' (抟垸刚柔). The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* cites the *Popular Explanations*: 'To form with the hands is called tuan.' The *Yijing*'s *Ganzou Degree* says: 'Look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; follow it and it cannot be grasped—hence it is called 'Change.'' The *Liezi*'s 'Heaven’s Gifts' chapter mirrors this. 'Grasp it and it cannot be held' (抟之不得) means 'follow it and it cannot be grasped' (循之不得); 'tuan' and 'xun' are phonetically close.\"* Ma Xulun adds: *\"The *Zhuangzi*'s 'Knowledge Wandered North' chapter reads 'grasp it and it cannot be held' (抟之而不得), likely following this passage, and also uses 'tuan.' The *Liezi* writes 'xun' (循), a loan for 'tun' (揗). The original text of the *Laozi* should read 'tun.' The *Shuowen* defines 'tun' as 'to rub.' The *Liji*'s 'Nei Ze' chapter reads 'follow its head' (循其首), also using 'xun' as a loan for 'tun.' Here, 'tuan' is likewise a loan for 'tun.'\"*\n\nQian notes: Yi and Ma’s arguments are sound. The *Huainanzi*'s \"The Dao in Its Original State\" chapter states: *\"Thus, look at it and its form cannot be seen; listen to it and its sound cannot be heard; follow it and its body cannot be grasped. Without form, yet forms arise; without sound, yet the five notes resound; without flavor, yet the five tastes take shape; without color, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and substance emerges from emptiness.\"* This passage directly employs the *Laozi*'s original text. The *Yijing*'s *Ganzou Degree*, the *Liezi*'s \"Heaven’s Gifts\" chapter, and the *Huainanzi*'s \"The Dao in Its Original State\" all pair *\"follow it and it cannot be grasped\"* (循之不得) with *\"look at it and it cannot be seen\"* (视之不见) and *\"listen to it and it cannot be heard\"* (听之不闻), confirming that the *Laozi*'s original text should read *\"xun\"* (循), a loan for *\"tun\"* (揗). The *Hanshu*'s \"Biography of Li Ling\" reads: *\"repeatedly followed his sword’s ring\"* (数数自循其刀环), with the commentary: *\"meaning to rub and stroke.\"*\n\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* states: \"揗 (*tun*), to rub, from the hand radical and the phonetic 盾 (*dun*).\" Zhu Junsheng notes: \"Today, the character 抚揗 (*futun*, to stroke) is written with 循 (*xun*).\" Thus, \"cannot be grasped by grasping\" (抟之不得) is equivalent to \"cannot be grasped by following\" (循之不得), and also to \"cannot be grasped by stroking and rubbing.\" These three expressions defy inquiry and are therefore blended into one.\n\nQian [Zhonglian] notes: The Fu edition includes the characters \"一者\" (*one being*) after \"一\" (*one*). The *Wenxuan* commentary on the \"Stele Inscription of the Toutuo Temple\" similarly cites this. Additionally, the Qingyang and Panxi editions read \"故复混而为一\" (*thus again blended into one*), while Sun Sheng’s *Doubts and Inquiries on the Laozi* cites it as \"混然为一\" (*blended into one*).\n\nAbove, it is not bright; below, it is not obscure.\nQian notes: All editions write \"其\" (*its*) instead of \"在\" (*in*); \"其\" is correct. \"皦\" is written as \"皦\" in the He, Yu, Fu, and Fan editions, and as \"皎\" in the Dunhuang Bing manuscript. Bi Yuan states: \"皦 may also be written as 皦, but the form with 日 is incorrect.\" However, Bi’s claim is mistaken, as discussed under the phrase \"常有，欲以观其徼\" (*constantly existing, desiring to observe its subtleties*) in Chapter One.\n\nVast and boundless, it cannot be named, returning once more to nothingness.\nYan Kejun notes: The *Yongle Dadian* writes \"绳绳\" as \"绳绳兮\" (*vast and boundless*). Qian notes: The Fu and Fan editions concur. The *Fuxing Ji* includes the character \"焉\" (*thereby*) after \"名\" (*named*) and omits \"物\" (*thing*) in \"复归于无\" (*returning to nothingness*). Takeuchi Yoshio states: According to the *Jingdian Shiwen*, only one \"绳\" (*sheng*) character is noted, with the annotation \"the He Shang Gong edition writes 绳.\" This is impossible to interpret. Lu Wenchang’s textual research argues that it should read \"绳绳\" (*shengsheng*), and since the Wang edition already writes \"绳绳,\" the He Shang Gong edition must also have written \"绳绳,\" differing from the Wang edition only in the presence or absence of the particle \"兮.\" The old manuscript of the He Shang Gong edition includes \"兮\" after \"绳绳,\" while the Lu commentary edition appears to have omitted the final \"兮.\"\n\nThis is called the formless form, the imageless image.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang Bing manuscript omits the character \"谓\" (*called*). Qian notes: The Suizhou edition concurs. Additionally, in \"无物之象\" (*the image of nothingness*), the editions of Su Che, Li Daochun, Lin Xiangyan, Wu Cheng, and Dong Sijing all write \"无象之象\" (*the imageless image*), which is superior in meaning. Gao Heng states: \"Writing '无象之象' is semantically stronger. First, '无状之状' (*formless form*) and '无象之象' (*imageless image*) follow the same syntactic structure. Second, the previous phrase already mentions '无物' (*nothingness*), so repeating '无物' here would be redundant.\" Now, considering the *Hanfeizi*’s *Explaining the Laozi*: \"People rarely see a living elephant, but when they obtain the bones of a dead elephant, they examine its diagram to imagine its living form. Thus, what people conceive in their minds is all called *image*. Though the Dao cannot be heard or seen, the sage grasps its manifest effects to perceive its form, hence the phrases *formless form* and *imageless image*.\" This serves as a third piece of evidence. The Suizhou edition writes \"像\" (*likeness*) instead of \"象\" (*image*).\n\nThis is called *huhuang* (flickering and indistinct).\n\nQian’s note: The two characters \"忽恍\" (*huhuang*) accord with the imperial commentary, the *Jingfu* edition, the *Heshang* edition, and Li Daochun’s version. Various Wang editions write \"惚恍\" (*huhuang*), while the Fu and Fan editions write \"芴芒\" (*wumang*). The *Shiwen* lists the character \"怳\" (*huang*), and the versions by Lu Xisheng, Huang Maocai, Chen Jingyuan, and Cao Daochong write \"惚怳\" (*huhuang*), while the Daozang *Heshang* edition writes \"忽怳\" (*huhuang*). In essence, \"怳\" (*huang*) and \"恍\" (*huang*) are the same character. Xi Tong states: \"'忽怳' (*huhuang*) may also be reversed as '怳忽' (*huanghu*), sharing the same meaning as '仿佛' (*faint and indistinct*).\" Jiang Xichang states: \"'惚恍' (*huhuang*) may also appear as '芴芒' (*wumang*) or '惚怳' (*huhuang*), all of which are reduplicative binomes and mutually interchangeable. Such binomes prioritize sound, and as long as the sounds are similar, they may be borrowed for one another. '恍惚' (*huanghu*) is thus equivalent to '仿佛' (*faint and indistinct*)... Yet Laozi deliberately inverts '恍惚' (*huanghu*) to '惚恍' (*huhuang*) because '象' (*image*) and '恍' (*huang*) rhyme.\" One cannot glimpse its head when approaching, nor see its rear when following.\n\nMa Xianzhi notes: In various editions, the character \"之\" (*zhi*) appears above the two \"不\" (*bu*) characters, but the *Yu zhu* edition, Dunhuang *Bing* manuscript, and British Library manuscripts all omit it. The *Guangming* edition and *Shitoku* edition reverse the two phrases, matching the *Wen Xuan*’s \"Toudasi Beiwen.\" Wu Yun states: \"The two characters '其后' (*its rear*) appear above '迎之' (*approaching it*), suggesting the two phrases are inverted.\"\n\nGrasp the ancient Dao to speak of the present’s existence.\nYan Kejun states: \"以语今之有\" (*to speak of the present’s existence*)—various editions write \"御\" (*to govern*). Ma Xianzhi notes: The *Suwen*’s \"Qi Jiaobian Dalun\" (Chapter 69) states: \"I have heard that those who speak well of Heaven must respond to man; those who speak well of the ancient must be verified in the present; those who speak well of qi must manifest in things.\" This chapter of the *Laozi* is precisely one that speaks well of qi. And \"grasp the ancient Dao to speak of the present’s existence\" is to speak of the ancient and be verified in the present. Grasping the ancient to speak of the present reveals that the Grand Scribe was one skilled in the art of history. Liu Shipei states: \"有\" (*existence*) is a loan character for \"域\" (*realm*). \"有\" (*you*) is interchangeable with \"或\" (*huo*), and \"或\" is the ancient form of \"域\" (*realm*). The *Book of Songs*’ \"Liezhu\" in the *Odes of Shang* reads: \"奄有九有\" (*encompassing the nine realms*), with the *Mao Commentary* stating: \"九域 (*nine realms*) refers to the nine provinces.\" Elsewhere, \"正域彼四方\" (*rectifying the realm of the four directions*), the *Mao Commentary* states: \"域 (*realm*) means 有 (*existence*).\" The *Guoyu*’s \"Chu Yu\" reads: \"共工氏之伯九有也\" (*Gonggong’s hegemony over the nine realms*), with Wei Zhao’s note: \"有 (*you*) means 域 (*realm*).\" Here, the character \"有\" is the same as in \"九有.\" \"有\" means \"域,\" and \"域\" is the same \"域\" as in Chapter 25’s \"域中有四大\" (*within the realm are the Four Greats*). \"御今之有\" (*governing the present’s existence*) thus means governing the present’s realm, the world, and the state. The *Book of Rites*’ \"Zhongyong\" reads: \"生乎今之世，反古之道\" (*born in the present age, one reverts to the ancient Dao*). This text’s \"今之有\" (*present’s existence*) is roughly equivalent to that \"今之世\" (*present age*).\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the foundation of the Dao.\nYan Kejun states: \"以知古始\" (*to know the ancient beginning*)—the *Yu zhu* edition and Wang Bi’s edition write \"能知\" (*can know*). Ma Xianzhi notes: All *Heshang Gong* editions, the *Guangming* edition, and the *Jingfu* edition write \"以知\" (*to know*). Wu Yun states: \"以知\" (*to know*)—Fu Yi’s edition writes \"能知\" (*can know*), matching this stone inscription. Ma Xianzhi notes: Fu Yi’s edition differs from the sutra pillar; Wu’s collation is incorrect. Yan Kejun states: \"是谓道已\" (*this is called the Dao’s foundation*)—the *Yu zhu* edition and *Heshang Gong* write \"道纪\" (*Dao’s discipline*), and upon careful examination, Wang Bi’s commentary also uses \"已\" (*foundation*). Ma Xianzhi notes: Writing \"纪\" (*discipline*) is correct. The character \"已\" (*foundation*) lacks meaning. The *Xiao Erya*’s \"Guangyan\" states: \"纪 (*discipline*) means 基 (*foundation*).\" \"纪\" is borrowed for \"基\" (*foundation*), so \"道纪\" (*Dao’s discipline*) means \"道基\" (*Dao’s foundation*).\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang Yong’s reading:\n- *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微), *jie* (诘), *yi* (一), *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme (脂 *zhi* department, *mei* pronounced *mi*);\n- *zhuang* (状), *xiang* (象), *huang* (恍) rhyme (阳 *yang* department, *huang* in departing tone);\n- *shou* (首), *hou* (后) rhyme (幽 *you* and 侯 *hou* departments in harmony);\n- *you* (有), *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme (之 *zhi* department).\n\nMa Xianzhi notes: *Yi* (夷)—Fan Qin’s edition writes \"几\" (*ji*), and in Jiang Yong’s \"Twenty-One Department Phonetic Series,\" *yi* (夷), *xi* (希), and *wei* (微) all belong to the 脂 *zhi* department. *Shou* (首) belongs to the 幽 *you* department, *hou* (后) to the 侯 *hou* department, with 幽 and 侯 in harmony. Yao Wentian: *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微) rhyme (五齐 *wu qi* level tone); *jie* (诘), *yi* (一) rhyme (四入 *si ru* entering tone); *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme (二月 *er yue* entering tone); *zhuang* (状), *xiang* (象), *huang* (恍) rhyme (十六庚 *shi liu geng* departing tone); *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), *you* (有) rhyme (十四○ *shi si ○* rising tone); *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme (四之 *si zhi* rising tone). The character *hou* (后) harmonizes with *hou* (侯), while *you* (有) shifts into the same rhyme. Deng Tingzhen concurs, though he does not mention *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), or *you* (有). *Jie* (诘) is pronounced *ji*, and *jie* (诘) and *yi* (一) are the entering tones of the 至 *zhi* department.\n\nXiao Tong: *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微) rhyme; *jie* (诘), *yi* (一), *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme; *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), *you* (有), *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme. The differing divisions among scholars further demonstrate that the original text was highly harmonious. For instance, *shou* (首) and *hou* (后) rhyme, yet Gu Yanwu doubted that \"后 (*rear*) in antiquity never rhymed with 首 (*head*), and *Laozi*’s '迎之不见其首，随之不见其后' (*approaching it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its rear*) is prose, not rhymed verse\" (*Tang Yun Zheng*, Volume 14, *Hou*). This shows his ignorance of the 幽 *you* and 侯 *hou* departments’ harmony, obscuring the true face of *Laozi*’s philosophical poetry.\n\nKong Guangsen’s *Shisheng Lei* (8, *Zhi* category) states: \"In antiquity, there was no distinction between departing and entering tones.\" As corroborating evidence, he cites the *Laozi*: \"其上不皦 (*its above is not bright*), 其下不昧 (*its below is not dark*). 绳绳不可名 (*endlessly unnameable*), 复归于无物 (*returning to nothingness*).\" Jiang Yougao’s *Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng* (8, *Wu*) states: \"*Wu* (物) is pronounced *wenfu* cut. According to ancient departing tones, it should be grouped with the 未 *wei* department. The *Laozi*’s 'Zan Xuan' chapter rhymes '复归于无物' (*returning to nothingness*) with '昧' (*dark*).\" Deng Tingzhen states: \"*Mei* (昧) and *wu* (物) rhyme; characters from the 未 *wei* and 勿 *wu* series share the same ancient pronunciation. The *Shuowen* lists *hu* (曶) and *mei* (昧) consecutively. *Hu* (曶) means 'profound darkness,' while *mei* (昧) means '昧爽 (*meishuang*), dawn’s light.' Their sounds are similar, and their meanings close, hence their characters appear in sequence. Sima Xiangru’s *Fu* reads '曶爽暗昧' (*profound darkness and obscurity*), with Wei Zhao reading *hu* (曶) as *mei kui* cut—all evidence that 未 *wei* and 勿 *wu* sounds belong to the same department.\"\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele edition contains ninety-two characters on the right; the Dunhuang annotated edition notes ninety (actually ninety-one); the He and Wang editions, ninety-four; the Fu edition, one hundred; and the Fan edition, ninety-five.\n\nThe He Shang Gong edition titles this chapter \"Zan Xuan (In Praise of the Mysterious) Fourteenth,\" the Wang edition titles it \"Chapter Fourteen,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Chapter on 'Invisible When Seen' Fourteenth.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThose of old who were adept in the Way—\nYu Yue states: He Shang Gong’s commentary reads, \"This refers to a ruler who has attained the Dao.\" Thus, \"adept in the *shi* (士)\" should be \"adept in the *shang* (上),\" hence his explanation as a ruler who has attained the Dao. The error arises from the similarity in form between *shang* (上) and *shi* (士).\nQian Zhi notes: Yu Yue’s interpretation is incorrect. According to He Shang Gong’s commentary, \"adept in the *shi* (士)\" should be \"adept in the *Dao* (道).\" The Fu Yi edition writes *Dao* (道) for *shi* (士), which serves as evidence.\nBi Yuan states: \"*Dao* (道) is written as *shi* (士) in the He Shang Gong and Wang Bi editions.\" However, *Dao* (道) is correct; the Gao Biao edition also writes *Dao* (道).\nMa Xulun states: The *Hou Han Shu*’s \"Biographies of the Disenfranchised\" quotes this as *Dao* (道). According to He Shang Gong’s commentary, it seems he also wrote *Dao* (道)... The *Shiwen* confirms that *Dao* (道) is correct. The current Wang Bi edition’s *shi* (士) likely derives from the text of Chapter Sixty-Eight. Further, this sentence shares the same meaning as Chapter Sixty-Five’s \"Those of old who were adept in the Dao,\" and it also resonates with the later phrase \"those who preserve this Dao.\"\n\nSubtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable.\nOnly because it is unknowable is one compelled to describe it:\nJiang Xichang states: The *Shiji*’s \"Biography of Laozi\" records Laozi as saying, \"...A good merchant hides his wealth as if empty; a noble person of great virtue appears foolish.\" This aligns with the meaning of \"subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable.\"\nYi Shunding states: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Zhang Zai’s *Fu on the Wei Capital* quotes Laozi: \"Those of old were subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable. Only because they were unknowable was one compelled to praise them.\" The character *song* (颂, \"praise\") is the ancient form, while *rong* (容, \"describe\") is the modern form... \"Compelled to describe it\" means \"compelled to depict it.\"\nChen Zhu states: The seal script form of *song* (颂) is \"○,\" so *rong* (容) is also an ancient loan character; no emendation is necessary.\nQian Zhi notes: \"Unknowable\" is written as \"unfathomable\" in the Fan edition, with a note stating, \"ancient edition.\"\n\nCautious, as if fording a river in winter;\nYan Kejun states: He Shang Gong writes *yu* (豫) as \"与兮,\" while Wang Bi writes \"豫焉.\"\nLuo Zhenyu states: The *Shiwen* notes that *yu* (豫) is sometimes written as *ao* (懊). The character *yan* (焉) appears as *xi* (兮) in the Jingfu edition. The Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and Dunhuang Bing editions omit *yan* (焉).\nLi Daochun states: \"Cautious, as if fording a river in winter\" is sometimes written as \"与兮,\" but versions omitting *xi* (兮) in the following six or three phrases are incorrect.\n\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;\nYan Kejun states: *You* (犹) is written as \"犹兮\" in the He Shang Gong and Wang Bi editions.\nWang Chang states: All editions include *xi* (兮) after *you* (犹); the Lu Xisheng to Yuan editions match this for both phrases.\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong and Imperial Commentary editions both omit *xi* (兮).\nQian Zhi notes: Ye Mengde’s *Yanxia Fangyan* (Part One) states: \"To be cautious before an event is called *yu* (豫); to be cautious after an event is called *you* (犹). *You* and *yu* are originally the names of two animals. Ancient language often borrowed from things to convey meaning, but later generations, familiar only with the meaning and not the original referents, arbitrarily fabricated explanations, leading to errors.\" Now, according to the *Erya*’s \"Explanation of Beasts,\" \"*You* resembles a muntjac and is skilled at climbing trees.\" The *Shiwen* cites the *Shizi*: \"*You* is a five-chi-tall dog.\" The *Shuowen*’s \"Dog\" section states: \"*You* belongs to the *jue* (玃) category. Another saying: In Longxi, a puppy is called *you* (猷).\" The *Yanshi Jiaxun*’s \"Evidence from Writing\" chapter states: \"*You* is the name of an animal. Upon hearing human sounds, it cautiously climbs trees, moving up and down in this manner, hence the term *youyu* (犹豫).\" The *Han Shu*’s \"Annals of Empress Gao\" reads, \"The plan was *youyu* (犹豫) and not yet decided,\" with Yan Shigu commenting: \"*You* is the name of an animal. The *Erya* states, '*You* resembles ○ and is skilled at climbing trees.' This animal is by nature suspicious and often dwells in mountains. Upon suddenly hearing a sound, it fears someone is coming to harm it, so it cautiously climbs a tree. After a long time with no one appearing, it dares to descend, only to climb again shortly after—repeating this behavior, hence indecision is called *youyu*. Another saying: In Longxi, a puppy is called *you*. Dogs follow people, often cautiously moving ahead, waiting for their owner. If the owner does not arrive, they return to greet them, hence the term *youyu*.\" *Youyu* is also written as *youyu* (犹与). The *Shiji*’s \"Annals of Empress Lü\" reads, \"*Youyu* (犹与) and not yet decided,\" with the *Suoyin* stating: \"*You* resembles an ape, with an upturned nose and long tail, and is by nature suspicious.\" The *Han Shu*’s \"Biography of Huo Guang\" reads, \"unable to bear *youyu* (犹与),\" with a note stating: \"*Youyu* means indecision.\" It is also written as *yin yu* (冘豫). The *Hou Han Shu*’s commentary on the \"Biography of Dou Wu\" states: \"*Yin yu* means unsettled.\" Gao You’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes it as *you yu* (由与).\nWang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi* (Volume Four, Part One) states: \"*Youyu* is a double-voiced word, akin to the *Chu Ci*’s *yiyou* (夷犹), and does not refer to an animal fearing humans and cautiously climbing trees, nor to a puppy cautiously moving ahead of its owner.\"\n\nBoth interpretations are plausible, though Wang’s is superior.\n\nHere it speaks of one who treads winter streams as if fearing the cold, who regards the four neighbors as if dreading enemies—*you* and *yu*, hesitating and not advancing—all to depict the demeanor shaped by circumstance.\n\n\"Solemn as a guest\":\nYan Kejun notes that the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions include the characters *xi qi* (兮其) after *yan* (俨). Wang Chang states that *Heshang Gong* reads *yan xi qi ruo ke* (俨兮其若客), while Wang Bi has *yan xi qi ruo rong* (俨兮其若容). Upon examination, *ke* (客, \"guest\") rhymes with the four characters *shi* (释), *pu* (朴), *gu* (谷), and *zhuo* (浊) below; the reading *rong* (容, \"demeanor\") is incorrect. Chen Zhu states that Wang Bi’s version writes *rong* (容) for *ke* (客). Luo Zhenyu observes that the *Jingfu* edition reads *ke* (客), while the *Jinglong*, *Yinglun*, and *Yuzhu* editions all read *yan ruo ke* (俨若客). Chen Zhu further notes that Fu Yi’s edition also reads *yan ruo ke* (俨若客); the reading *ke* (客) is correct. *Ke* (客) and *shi* (释) form a rhyme. The reading *rong* (容) arises from a misreading of the preceding phrase *qiang wei zhi rong* (强为之容, \"forced demeanor\").\n\n\"Melting like ice about to dissolve\":\nYan Kejun notes that *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi read *huan xi ruo bing zhi jiang shi* (涣兮若冰之将释), with *xi* (兮) appearing in the next three phrases. Luo Zhenyu states that the *Jinglong*, *Yinglun*, and *Yuzhu* editions all read *huan ruo bing jiang shi* (涣若冰将释). Takeuchi Yoshio notes that the Dunhuang manuscript writes *zhuo* (汋) for *shi* (释). Qian Zhixi observes that the Suizhou edition also writes *zhuo* (汋). Liu Shipei states that the *Wenzi*’s \"Shang Ren\" chapter reads *huan xi qi ruo bing zhi ye* (涣兮其若冰之液). It is suspected that the *Daodejing*’s ancient text read *ye* (液, \"fluid\"). The phrase *jiang shi* (将释, \"about to dissolve\") appears to be a later gloss, which editors incorporated into the main text. Yi Shunding notes that the *Kaogong Ji*’s \"Gong Ren\" commentary reads *ye* (液) as *shi* (醳). The *Shanhaijing*’s \"Beishan Jing\" states, \"*Ye* (液) is pronounced like *yi* (悦) in *yiyi* (悦怿).\" *Shi* (醳) and *yi* (怿) both interchange with *shi* (释)... The *Gu Ming*’s \"Wang bu yi\" (王不怿) is written as *wang bu shi* (王不释) in Ma Rong’s version, serving as evidence. *Ye* (液) shares the same pronunciation and meaning as *shi* (释), hence their interchangeability. Jiang Xichang states that the *Shuowen* defines *shi* (释) as \"to dissolve\" and *ye* (液) as \"water exhausted.\" Ice may be said to dissolve but not to be \"water exhausted,\" so *shi* (释) is contextually superior. However, *shi* (释) was also borrowed as *ye* (液) in antiquity. The *Liji*’s \"Yue Ling\" reads *bing dong xiao shi* (冰冻消释), with the *Shiwen* noting, \"*Shi* (释) is originally written as *ye* (液).\" This is an example. The *Wenzi*’s *ye* (液) is a loan character, while the *Daodejing*’s *shi* (释) is the original.\n\n\"Uncarved as raw wood, turbid as muddy water, vast as a valley.\"\nYan Kejun notes that the *Yuzhu* edition reads *kuang ruo gu, hun ruo zhuo* (旷若谷，浑若浊), while *Heshang Gong* reads *kuang xi qi ruo gu, hun xi qi ruo zhuo* (旷兮其若谷，浑兮其若浊). Wang Bi’s version matches *Heshang Gong*’s, with *hun* (混) for *hun* (浑). Wang Chang states that the Xingzhou edition reads *hun ruo pu, kuang ruo gu, hun ruo zhuo* (混若朴，旷若谷，混若浊), matching this passage’s syntax; the Dunhuang edition’s *hun* (混) may be an error influenced by the following text. Wei Jiasun notes that in *zhen zhi pu* (镇之朴), the *Yuzhu* edition writes *pu* (朴), while the others write *pu* (扑). Yan Kejun’s collation of *pu* (朴), *pu sui xiao* (朴虽小), and *zhi pu* (之朴) omits the *pu* (扑) variant. He observes that wood-radical clerical script often borrows the hand radical, and Tang-era rhyme schemes were inconsistent; this final instance may be disregarded in later collations. Qian Zhixi notes that *hun* (混) and *hun* (浑) are interchangeable. The *Yuzhu*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panxi, Lou Zheng, Shitang, *Heshang Gong*, Gu Huan, Li Daochun, and Fan Yingyuan editions all write *hun* (浑). Wang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi* (Volume Nine) states, \"*Hun* (混) and *hun* (浑) were homophonous in antiquity.\"\n\nCan the turbid be stilled through serenity?\n\nWei Jiasun states: Stele inscriptions uniformly use *shu* (孰) for *shu* (熟). The *Yuzhu* edition writes *shu* (熟) in \"ripen it to maturity,\" while I write *shu* (孰); Yan’s collation is incomplete.\n\nQian Zhixi notes: The character *shu* (熟) did not exist in antiquity. The *Shuowen* defines *shu* (孰) as \"food cooked to doneness.\" The *Liji Liyun* reads: \"Then they ate raw flesh and chewed *shu* (孰) grain.\" The *Hanshu Yan An zhuan* states: \"The five grains flourished and *shu* (孰).\" *Shu* (孰) and *shu* (熟) are interchangeable; the fire radical was a later addition. The *Gongyang Commentary* to *Yin 1* asks: \"Whom does the *wangzhe* (王者) refer to?\" The *Lunyu* states: \"What cannot be endured?\" The commentary explains: \"Who.\" *Shui* (谁) and *shu* (孰) are phonetic shifts of the same word. Bi Yuan notes: The *Heshang Gong* edition reads: \"Who can still the turbid through serenity, slowly clarifying?\" Some versions write *zhi* (止) for *yi* (以), rhyming with the following *jiu* (久); this is likely correct.\n\nHow can it be stirred into motion? Slowly arising.\n\nYan Kejun states: The *Yuzhu* edition writes \"how can it endure for long,\" while the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions read \"who can endure for long.\" The *Dayian* omits the character *jiu* (久). Takeuchi Yoshio notes: The Dunhuang, Jing, and Sui manuscripts all lack the two instances of *shu neng* (孰能).\n\nQian Zhixi notes: These two lines differ across editions. The Fu edition reads: \"Who can still the turbid to clarity, slowly clarifying? Who can endure in stillness to stir motion, slowly arising?\" The Fan edition omits *cheng* (澄) in the first line but matches the second. The *Guangming* edition reads: \"Who can still the turbid, stirring it to slow clarity? Who can endure for long, stirring it to □□ (the characters *xu sheng* (徐生) are effaced)?\" The character *xu* (徐) carries the meaning of leisurely, unhurried, or gradual. The *Shuowen* defines *xu* (徐) as \"slow.\" The *Erya* *Shitian* Li commentary states: \"*Xu* (徐) means leisurely.\" The *Erya* *Shidi* Li commentary explains: \"Between the Huai and the sea, the *qi* is expansive and unhurried, the temperament calm and gradual, hence the name *Xu* (徐).\" \"Still the turbid, slowly clarifying\" parallels \"endure in stillness, slowly arising.\" Wu Cheng states: \"The turbid is the moment of motion; when followed by stillness, it gradually clarifies. Stillness is the moment of rest; when stillness is followed by motion, it gradually arises.\"\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\n\nBi Yuan states: Gao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* notes, \"The character *bao* (保) is sometimes written as *fu* (服).\" Ma Xulun remarks: \"According to the Zhuang edition of the *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun*, *bao* (保) is written as *fu* (复); the Wang edition concurs. The *Wenzi* *Shou Ruo* chapter writes it as *fu* (服). I contend that *bao* (保), *fu* (复), and *fu* (服) are interchangeable through the *zhi* and *you* rhyme groups.\" Jiang Xichang argues: \"Though *bao* (保), *fu* (复), and *fu* (服) may be interchangeable, the Zhuang edition of the *Huainanzi* should be followed, using *fu* (复). The *Shuowen* defines *fu* (复) as 'to go and come.' Duan Yucai’s commentary on the radical states: '*Fan* (返) means to return; *huan* (还) means to revert.' Both denote going and then coming back, so *fu* (复) shares the same meaning as *fan* (返) and *huan* (还). In Chapter 40, 'Reversion is the movement of the Dao'—*fan* (反) is *fan* (返). Thus, 'One who reverts to this Dao does not desire fullness' is akin to saying 'One who returns to this Dao does not desire fullness.' Only by not being full can one remain worn yet whole.\"\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"The *Yu zhu* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能弊不新成); the *Heshang Gong* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能蔽不新成); the *Dayian* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能敝不新成). Wang Bi’s commentary explains *bi* (蔽) as 'to cover,' aligning with the *Heshang Gong* edition.\" Hong Yixuan observes: \"'The character *bi* (蔽) contrasts with *xin* (新); here, *bi* (蔽) is interchangeable with *bi* (敝). Below, 'Worn, then renewed'—the *Shiwen* writes *bi* (弊) as *bi* (蔽). In the *Analects* *Zihan*, 'worn-out quilted robe'—the *Shiwen* notes: '*Bi* (弊) is originally written as *bi* (敝).' In the *Zhuangzi* *Xiaoyaoyou*, 'Who would weary themselves thus?'—the *Shiwen* states: 'Sima Biao’s edition writes *bi* (蔽).' These characters were interchangeable in ancient script.\" Yu Yue asserts: \"*Bi* (蔽) is a loan for *bi* (敝). The Tang *Jinglong* stele writes *bi* (弊), also a loan for *bi* (敝). The *Yongle Dadian* correctly writes *bi* (敝). The three characters *bu xin cheng* (不新成) appear as *fu cheng* (复成) in the *Jinglong* stele. However, the *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun* quotes the *Laozi* as saying, 'One who adheres to this Dao does not desire fullness, thus can be worn yet not newly whole.' This matches the ancient text, though the modern edition omits the character *er* (而), leaving the meaning incomplete.\"\n\nYi Shunding proposes: \"It likely should read *gu neng bi er xin cheng* (故能蔽而新成). *Bi* (蔽) is a loan for *bi* (敝); *bu* (不) is a scribal error for *er* (而). *Bi* (敝) contrasts with *xin* (新); 'can be worn yet newly whole' echoes Chapter 22’s 'Worn, then renewed,' paralleling the earlier 'can be turbid yet clear, can be still yet arise.'\" The *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun* reads *gu neng bi er bu xin cheng* (故能蔽而不新成), confirming the ancient text included *er* (而), while *bu* (不) was likely a later interpolation. The *Wenzi* *Shi Shou* chapter reads *shi yi bi bu xin cheng* (是以蔽不新成), also a later alteration. Some editions read *er bu cheng* (而不成) or *fu cheng* (复成), but these distort the meaning. Emendations based on conjecture are less reliable than cross-referencing the text itself.\n\nQian Jibo’s case: Qian Daxin states, \"'Thus can be covered yet not newly whole'—the stone inscription reads *neng bi fu cheng* (能弊复成), far superior to other editions.\" This is correct. The Fu edition reads *shi yi neng bi er bu cheng* (是以能敝而不成), omitting *xin* (新) and contradicting the *Laozi*’s meaning. Yi’s argument, using \"Worn, then renewed\" to support *gu neng bi er xin cheng* (故能蔽而新成), is stronger than Yu Yue’s interpretation of \"preferring wear over freshness.\" Chen Jiru’s *Laozi Jun* claims, \"To be worn yet not newly whole means unchanging, like a single day spanning a hundred years\"—utterly pedantic. In the *Zhengyi* commentary, *neng bi fu cheng* (能蔽复成) corresponds to the earlier line \"One who reverts to this Dao does not desire fullness.\" Thus, *bi er xin cheng* (蔽而新成) is less fitting than the *Jinglong*, *Suizhou*, Li Rong, and Sima Guang editions’ *bi er fu cheng* (蔽而复成), which align more closely with the *Laozi*’s meaning.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme groups, per Jiang Yong’s reading:\n- *tong*, *rong* (東部);\n- *chuan*, *lin* (文、真通韻, *chuan* rhymes with *chun*);\n- *ke*, *shi* (魚部, *shi* in *shurusheng*);\n- *pu*, *gu*, *zhuo* (侯部, *pu* as *pangmu* 旁木反, *zhuo* as *zhaimu* 宅木反).\n\nThe *qing*, *sheng*, *ying*, *ying*, and *cheng* rhyme in the *Geng* group.\n\nMoreover, Xi Dong and Karlgren both treat *ke*, *shi*, *pu*, *gu*, and *zhuo* as a single rhyme, while Yao Wentian groups *ke* and *shi* as one rhyme (the entering tone of *wuxi*) and *pu*, *gu*, and *zhuo* as another (the entering tone of *liuwu*). Karlgren renders *yu xi* (豫兮) as *ao xi* (懊兮), with *ao* rhyming with *you* (犹), *yan* (俨) with *huan* (涣), and *dun* (敦) with *hun* (混). In reality, *yan* and *huan* do not rhyme.\n\nThe character *ke* (客) is also written as *rong* (容), while *shi* (释) appears alternatively as *zhuo* (汋) or *ye* (液), all of which maintain the rhyme. Furthermore, in the line *\"shu neng zhuo yi jing zhi, xu qing\"* (孰能浊以静之，徐清), the character *jing* (静) is preceded by *zhi* (止) in some versions, with *zhi* rhyming with the subsequent *jiu* (久), while *cheng* (澄) rhymes with the following *qing* (清) as well as *sheng*, *ying*, and *cheng*.\n\nAdditionally, it is noted that in stele versions of this chapter, the particle *xi* (兮) is omitted, thereby losing the melodic beauty of the Chu dialect in the *Five Thousand Words*. This should be corrected according to other editions. Tan Xian’s *Futang Diary* (Volume 5) states: *\"The stone inscriptions from Yizhou use the fewest particles, leading some to consider them closer to antiquity. Fu Yi’s definitive edition, predating the stone versions, contains the most particles, yet both extremes likely deviate from the original—too much is as flawed as too little.\"* This precisely refers to such cases.\n\nGu Yanwu’s *Rectification of Tang Rhymes* (Volume 52, *Geng* group) states: *\"Sheng\" (生) is pronounced *suo geng*, and should be written as *suo zheng*.* It cites the *Laozi*:\n\n*\"Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other.\"*\n\n*\"Who can still the turbid to gradually attain clarity?\nWho can stir the tranquil to gradually bring forth life?\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nOnly by not being full can one remain unspoiled and not newly completed.\"*\n\n*\"Of old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe spirits attained the One and became efficacious,\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life,\nThe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version contains eighty characters; the Dunhuang manuscript notes eighty (in fact, seventy-nine); the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions, ninety-seven; the Fu Yi version, ninety-eight; and the Fan Yingyuan version, ninety-nine. The *Heshang Gong* version titles this chapter *\"Manifesting Virtue, Fifteen\"*; the Wang Bi version, *\"Chapter Fifteen\"*; and the Fan Yingyuan version, *\"The Chapter on the Ancient Masters of the Dao, Fifteen.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nAttain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness.\nQian’s note: The character *\"zhi\"* (致) is written as *\"zhi\"* (至) in the *Jingfu* and *Heshang Gong* versions. The character *\"du\"* (笃) appears as *\"○\"* in the *Jinglong*, *Jingfu*, Zhao Mengfu, and other versions. The *Character Dictionary* states: *\"Du* (笃), from the *Shuowen*: ‘A horse’s gait slows and falters; from *ma* (马) and phonetic *zhu* (竹).’ Commonly written as *○*.\" Additionally, the *Shitoku* version includes the particle *\"ye\"* (也) after *\"ji\"* (极) and *\"du\"* (笃).\n\nQian’s note: The *Laozi* mentions *\"xu\"* (虚, emptiness) five times, but only in Chapter Five (*\"xu er bu qu\"* 虚而不屈, \"empty yet unexhausted\") and this chapter (*\"zhi xu ji\"* 致虚极, \"attain utmost emptiness\") does it seem to carry the meaning of *\"xuwu\"* (虚无, emptiness and nothingness). The *Guangya* (*Explanations of Terms*, Volume 3) defines *\"xu\"* as *\"kong\"* (空, void). The *Western Capital Rhapsody* states: *\"There was one called the Master of Emptiness,\"* with the commentary: *\"Xu* means *wu* (无, nothingness).\" *Xu* also implies an empty cavity, hence its gloss as void or nothingness. However, the doctrine of emptiness and nothingness is a later misinterpretation derived from *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*; the *Laozi* contains no such notion. *\"Empty yet unexhausted, moving yet ever emerging\"* reflects the *Laozi*’s grasp of the *Yijing*’s principles of change, expansion, and contraction. As Shao Yong said, *\"Laozi grasped the essence of the *Yi*,\"* precisely referring to this. *\"Attaining utmost emptiness\"* aligns with holding fast to the essential and embracing the root, maintaining clarity and emptiness—akin to the *Analects*’ *\"cultivating oneself to bring peace to the people.\"* Wang Tong’s remark, *\"When clarity and emptiness prevailed, the Jin court fell into chaos—this was not Laozi’s fault,\"* refers to this very principle.\n\nAll things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\nYan Kejun notes: The Wang Bi version omits the character *\"qi\"* (其). Ji Yun states: The *Heshang Gong* commentary and other versions all include *\"qi\"* after *\"guan\"* (观). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, *Jingfu*, and British Library versions all include *\"qi\"* after *\"guan.\"* Jiang Xichang states: The *Huainanzi* (*Daoying* chapter) reads, *\"I thereby observe their return,\"* and the *Wenzi* (*Daoyuan* chapter) also includes *\"qi.\"* The Wang Bi version omits it and should be corrected accordingly. Wang Bi’s commentary—*\"observing their reversion through emptiness and stillness\"*—serves as evidence.\n\nThe teeming things,\nEach returns to its root.\nQian’s note: *\"Yun yun\"* (云云) appears as *\"yun yun\"* (芸芸) in the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions, and as *\"fan wu ○○\"* (凡物○○) in the Fu and Fan versions. The *Zhuangzi* (*Zai You* chapter), the commentary to Jiang Yan’s *\"Miscellaneous Imitations\"* in the *Wen Xuan*, and the Suizhou stele version all render it as *\"yun yun.\"* The original likely read *\"yun yun.\"* The characters *\"○\"* and *\"yun\"* are interchangeable. Gu Yewang’s *Jade Chapters* (*Yun* section) cites the *Laozi*: *\"All things teeming, returning to their root.\"* Here, *\"yun\"* denotes restlessness. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: *\"Clouds drift westward, teeming without cease through winter and summer,\"* and the *Han History* reads: *\"Those who expound teem endlessly,\"* both employing the same sense. Alternatively, *\"○\"* (from the *Jade Chapters*) is pronounced *yun* or *yun*, meaning *\"the disorder of things.\"* The *Shuowen* defines it as *\"the chaotic disorder of things,\"* which also fits. Another theory holds that *\"yun yun\"* is an abbreviation of *\"○○,\"* with Fu Yi using the original character.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to destiny;\nReturning to destiny is called constancy;\nKnowing constancy is called enlightenment.\nQian’s note: *\"Stillness is called returning to destiny\"* appears identically in the *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xun, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Wang Xizhi, Gao Bi, Zhao Mengfu, Fu, and Fan versions, as well as this stele. The *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions read *\"This is called returning to destiny.\"*\n\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nYan Kejun states: *\"Forgetting action brings misfortune\"* appears in other versions as *\"reckless action brings misfortune.\"* The *Heshang Gong* version occasionally writes *\"wei\"* (萎), which is erroneous.\nQian’s note: *\"Wang\"* (忘, forgetting) and *\"wang\"* (妄, recklessness) were interchangeable in antiquity. Han Fei’s *Explaining the Laozi* reads: *\"Those with foresight lack cause and forget their intentions,\"* with Wang Xianshen’s commentary: *\"Wang* is interchangeable with *wang* (妄).\" The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xiang, Year 27) commentary states: *\"Speaking of the Duke’s frequent forgetfulness,\"* with the *Exegesis* noting: *\"Wang* is also written as *wang* (妄).\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Robber Zhi\" chapter states: *\"Thus, to uphold the upright without forgetting,\"* with the *Exegesis* noting: *\"‘Forgetting’ is sometimes written as ‘recklessness.’\"* This further confirms the ancient interchangeability of *wang* (忘) and *wang* (妄). Thus, *\"reckless action brings misfortune\"* is equivalent to *\"forgetting action brings misfortune.\"*\n\nHere, *\"returning to destiny is called constancy\"* and *\"not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune\"* align with the *Yijing*’s meaning. The *Xugua Zhuan* states: *\"Returning precludes recklessness, hence it is followed by ‘Wuwang’ (No Recklessness).\"*\n\nKnowing constancy brings tolerance,\ntolerance brings impartiality,\nimpartiality brings kingship,\nkingship brings heaven,\nheaven brings the Dao,\nthe Dao brings enduringness.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Tolerance brings impartiality\"*—the *Yu zhu*, *Heshang Gong*, and Wang Bi versions write *\"nai\"* (乃) instead of *\"neng\"* (能), and the same applies to the following four lines. Additionally, *\"impartiality brings kingship\"* and the subsequent four lines appear in the Xingzhou edition as *\"impartiality brings life, life brings heaven.\"*\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio observes: The phrase *\"knowing constancy\"* is followed by a *\"yue\"* (曰) in the old manuscript of the *Heshang Gong* version and the *Guangming Chuang*, though most versions omit it. ... According to the commentary’s meaning, Wang Bi’s edition also includes *\"yue.\"*\n\n*\"Impartiality brings life\"*—in most Wang Bi editions, *\"sheng\"* (生, life) is written as *\"wang\"* (王, kingship). This has been corrected based on the Dunhuang unannotated version and the *Daozang*’s *Cijie* edition.\n\nLao Jian remarks: *\"Knowing constancy brings tolerance, tolerance brings impartiality\"*—*\"tolerance\"* (容) and *\"impartiality\"* (公) form a rhyme. *\"Heaven brings the Dao, the Dao brings enduringness\"*—*\"Dao\"* (道) and *\"enduringness\"* (久) form a rhyme. However, the two lines *\"impartiality brings kingship, kingship brings heaven\"* lack a close rhyme. The character *\"wang\"* (王, kingship) is inherently dubious. Wang Bi’s commentary on these two lines states: *\"Utterly impartial, one reaches all-pervading universality; all-pervading universality then attains unity with heaven.\"* Yet *\"all-pervading universality\"* clearly does not explicate *\"kingship.\"* The *Daozang*’s *Longxing Stele* edition reads *\"impartiality brings life, life brings heaven,\"* but *\"life\"* (生) is even more inexplicable.\n\nUpon examination, the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Heaven and Earth\" chapter states: *\"Those who grasp the Dao attain complete virtue; those with complete virtue attain complete form; those with complete form attain complete spirit; those with complete spirit embody the sage’s Dao.\"* The character *\"wang\"* (王) in these two lines is likely a corruption of *\"quan\"* (全, complete). Thus, *\"impartiality brings completeness, completeness brings heaven\"*—*\"completeness\"* (全) and *\"heaven\"* (天) form a rhyme. Wang Bi’s commentary on *\"all-pervading universality\"* is apt. Furthermore, the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Bensheng\" chapter states: *\"The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve heaven’s completeness,\"* with Gao You’s commentary: *\"‘Complete’ means ‘accordant.’\"* This supplements Wang Bi’s incomplete exegesis. The modern *\"wang\"* (王) and the stele’s *\"sheng\"* (生) are both corrupted forms of *\"quan\"* (全), with *\"sheng\"* (生) being particularly graphically similar to *\"quan\"* (全), serving as evidence of textual evolution.\n\nOne’s body does not perish in danger.\n\nQian’s note: The *Yu zhu* edition writes *\"mo\"* (殁) instead of *\"mei\"* (没), and the Fu and Fan editions also use *\"mo.\"* Lao Jian’s *Ancient Textual Study* mistakenly follows the Fu edition in writing *\"mei.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhymes, according to Jiang Yong:\n- *du* (笃) and *fu* (复) rhyme (幽 rhyme group),\n- *yun* (芸) and *gen* (根) rhyme (文 rhyme group),\n- *jing* (静) and *ming* (命) rhyme (耕 rhyme group),\n- *chang* (常), *ming* (明), *chang* (常), *xiong* (凶), *rong* (容), *gong* (公), and *wang* (王) rhyme (阳 and 东 rhyme groups in harmonized rhyme; *ming* reads *mang*, *xiong* rhymes with *xuwang*, *rong* rhymes with *wang*, *gong* rhymes with *guang*).\n\n*Dao* (道), *jiu* (久), and *dai* (殆) rhyme (之 and 幽 rhyme groups in harmonized rhyme; *dao* rhymes with *tuyi*, *jiu* reads *yi*, *dai* rhymes with *tuyi*).\n\nQian’s note: *Chang* (常), *ming* (明), and *wang* (王) belong to the 阳 rhyme group; *xiong* (凶), *rong* (容), and *gong* (公) belong to the 东 rhyme group, with 阳 and 东 in harmonized rhyme. Additionally, *dai* (殆) belongs to the 之 rhyme group, while *dao* (道) and *jiu* (久) span the 之 and 幽 rhyme groups, with 之 and 幽 in harmonized rhyme.\n\nYao Wentian groups *chang* (常) and *ming* (明) as one rhyme (十六庚, level tone) and *xiong* (凶), *rong* (容), and *gong* (公) as another (一东, level tone). Deng Tingzhen concurs.\n\nGu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, fascicle 52 (庚):\n*\"Ming* (明) was anciently pronounced *molang*; by phonetic principles, it should be *milang.\"* Citing the *Laozi*:\n- *\"Returning to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination.\"*\n- *\"Not seeing oneself is illumination; not asserting oneself is clarity.\"*\n- *\"Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand; those who stride cannot walk. Those who see themselves are not illuminated; those who assert themselves are not clear.\"*\n- *\"Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is illumination. Overcoming others requires strength; overcoming oneself is power.\"*\n- *\"This is called subtle illumination: the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong.\"*\n- *\"Seeing the small is illumination; preserving softness is power. Using its light, returning to its illumination, leaving no harm to the body—this is called practicing constancy.\"*\n- *\"Knowing harmony is constancy; knowing constancy is illumination.

By the eighth month, there will be misfortune, for decline does not endure.\"*\n- *Qian* hexagram commentary: *\"The dragon soars with regret—fullness cannot endure. The nine in the fifth place: Heaven’s virtue cannot be primary.\"*\n- *Daguo* hexagram commentary: *\"The withered poplar blooms—how can this endure? The old woman and the young man—how shameful!\"*\n- *Li* hexagram commentary: *\"Treading cautiously to avoid blame; yellow and radiant—attaining the central Dao.\"*\n\nHere the *Li* hexagram commentary concludes: *\"The sun declining from its zenith—how can this endure?\"*\n\nThe *Jiji* hexagram commentary rhymes *bèi* (惫), *yí* (疑), *shí* (时), and *lái* (来), while the *Zagua* rhymes *zhǐ* (止), thus preserving both *jǐ* and *jiǔ* pronunciations in the transmitted *Yijing* texts.\n\nLaozi states: *\"One who does not lose their place endures; one who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\"* Now, Laozi and Confucius were contemporaries, and in Laozi’s text, the character *jiǔ* (久) appears three times—once rhyming with *dài* (殆), once with *mǔ* (母), and once with *shòu* (寿).\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele version contains sixty-seven characters; the Dunhuang version, sixty-six; the Heshang version, sixty-eight; and the Wang, Fu, and Fan versions, sixty-seven. The Heshang version titles this \"Returning to the Root, Sixteen\"; the Wang version, \"Chapter Sixteen\"; and the Fan version, \"Attaining the Utmost of Emptiness, Sixteen.\"\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nIn the highest antiquity, the people merely knew their rulers existed.\n*Qian’s note:* The *Liji·Quli* states, *\"In the highest antiquity, virtue was prized; next, reciprocity was practiced.\"* Zheng Xuan annotates: *\"The highest antiquity refers to the age of emperors and kings, when the people gave without expecting return.\"* What Laozi describes is precisely the perfect governance of remote antiquity, where the Dao pervaded and nurtured all under heaven, yet no active governance was imposed. The people, immersed in non-action, forgot their rulers’ existence.\n\n*\"The people merely knew their rulers existed\"*—Ji Yun notes: *\"The Yongle Encyclopedia has ‘不’ (not) instead of ‘下’ (merely); Wu Cheng’s edition also reads ‘不’.\"* Now, Jiao Hong’s *Laozi Yi* follows Wu Cheng’s version. Additionally, Wang Bi’s old annotated edition, appended with Sun Kuang’s textual corrections, states: *\"Modern editions read ‘不’ instead of ‘下’.\"* The reading *\"did not know\"* also yields a profound meaning.\n\nNext, they were cherished and praised.\nYan Kejun notes: The imperial commentary and Heshang versions read *\"cherished and praised them,\"* while Wang Bi’s reads *\"cherished and praised them.\"* *Qian’s note:* Fu Yi’s edition reads *\"next, they were cherished; next, they were praised.\"*\n\nNext, they were awed and scorned.\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang version includes *\"next\"* after *\"awed them.\"* Li Daochun states: *\"Next, they were awed; next, they were scorned\"*—those who read *\"awed and scorned them\"* are incorrect. Yu Shengwu notes: He’s collated edition omits the second *\"next.\"* Ji Yun observes that the *Yongle Encyclopedia* lacks *\"next\"* before *\"scorned them.\"* The correct reading is *\"next, they were awed; next, they were scorned.\"* The preceding line reads *\"next, they were cherished and praised,\"* and the Heshang version correctly uses *\"之\"* (them) instead of *\"而\"* (and). All stone inscriptions concur (the *Jinglong* stele writes *\"豫\"* for *\"誉,\"* as the two were interchangeable in antiquity). The two lines form a parallel structure.\n\n*\"Awed\"* should be read as *\"威\"* (authority), as the two were interchangeable in antiquity, requiring no further proof. The *Guangya·Shigu* defines *\"侮\"* (scorn) as *\"轻\"* (disdain). *\"Authority\"* and *\"scorn\"* are semantically linked, just as *\"cherished\"* and *\"praised\"* in the preceding line are mutually reinforcing.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises!\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang and Wang Bi versions include *\"焉\"* (thus) after *\"insufficient.\"* Wang Bi’s version also adds *\"焉\"* after *\"distrust.\"* Wang Niansun states: The version without *\"焉\"* is correct. *\"Trust is insufficient\"* forms one phrase; *\"thus distrust arises\"* forms another. *\"焉\"* means *\"thereupon\"*—when trust is insufficient, distrust follows. The *Lüshi Chunqiu·Jichun* commentary states: *\"焉* means *thereupon.*\"* The *Pinli* records: *\"At the feast, qi was emitted, thus filling the vessel.\"* That is, qi was emitted, *thereupon* filling the vessel. The *Zuozhuan·Jin Yu* states: *\"焉 began issuing decrees,\"* meaning *thereupon* decrees were issued.\n\nThus the *Questions of Three Years* states: \"Therefore, the former kings *thereupon* established moderation and regulation.\" That is, the former kings *thereupon* established moderation and regulation for them. The *Guanzi·Kuidu* states: \"When the people’s wealth is sufficient, the ruler’s levies *thereupon* know no end.\" That is, the levies *thereupon* know no end.\n\nLater scholars, failing to grasp the meaning of *\"焉\"* (thereupon), mistakenly treated *\"信不足焉\"* (\"trust is insufficient, thereupon\") as a single phrase. Thus, they added another *\"焉\"* at the end of the following line to create parallelism, unaware of their error.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Wang’s interpretation is correct. However, while Wang recognized that the *\"焉\"* in the second line was superfluous, he did not suspect that the *\"焉\"* in the first line might also be an interpolation. The versions of the *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Gu Huan, Gao Di, and others all omit *\"焉\"* in both lines, matching this stele.\n\n*\"By its esteemed words.\"*\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* writes *\"由\"* (\"by\") as *\"犹\"* (\"still\"), the *Heshang Gong* version as *\"犹兮\"* (\"still, ah\"), and Wang Bi’s as *\"悠兮\"* (\"leisurely, ah\"). Lu Deming states: *\"悠\"* (\"leisurely\") is written as *\"由\"* (\"by\") in the versions of Sun Deng, Zhang Ping, and Du Bi, with one variant reading *\"犹\"* (\"still\").\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panxi, Lou Zheng, Shichō, Gu Huan, Gao Di, Peng Si, and Fan Yingyuan all write *\"犹\"* (\"still\"). *\"由\"* (\"by\") and *\"犹\"* (\"still\") are interchangeable. The *Xunzi·Fuguo* states: *\"由* (still) will not suffice to encourage them,\" with the commentary: \"Interchangeable with *犹* (still).\" The *Chuci* reads: *\"尚由由而进之\"* (\"still hesitantly advancing\"), with the commentary: \"Meaning *犹豫* (hesitant).\" In Chapter 15 of the *Laozi*, *\"犹兮若畏四邻\"* (\"still, as if fearing the four neighbors\") aligns in meaning with the *\"由\"* (\"by\") in *\"由其贵言\"* (\"by its esteemed words\"), both conveying a sense of leisurely contemplation. Thus, writing it as *\"悠\"* (\"leisurely\") is also semantically valid.\n\n*\"Success achieved, affairs completed, the hundred clans say: ‘We are naturally thus.’\"*\nYan Kejun notes: Most versions read *\"功成\"* (\"success achieved\"), but the *Jingfu* and *Dunhuang Jia* versions read *\"成功遂事\"* (\"success achieved, affairs completed\"), which is preferable.\n\n*\"The hundred clans say: ‘We are naturally thus.’\"* The *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions include *\"皆\"* (\"all\") before *\"谓\"* (\"say\"). Fan Yingyuan’s version reads: *\"百姓皆曰我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\"). The *Zhuangzi·Gengsang Chu*, in Guo Xiang’s commentary, cites it as *\"而百姓皆谓我自尔\"* (\"and the hundred clans all say: ‘We are thus of ourselves’\"). The *Jingxun Tang* version of Fu reads: *\"百姓皆曰我不然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are not thus’\"). The *Book of Jin·Wang Tanzhi* in *\"On Abolishing Zhuangzi\"* states: *\"成功遂事，百姓皆曰我自然\"* (\"success achieved, affairs completed, the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\"), matching the text of *Kaizen’s Exegesis of the Laozi* and the *Book of Jin*.\n\nSong Xiangfeng notes: *\"百姓皆谓我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\")—the *Baihutong·Haotian* states: \"The Yellow Emperor ruled the world under the title *Ziran* (Naturally). *Ziran* means ‘solely vast and great virtue.’\" Here, *\"百姓皆谓我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\") directly quotes the Yellow Emperor’s words. The following line, *\"希言自然\"* (\"sparse words are natural\"), further elaborates on *ziran* (naturalness), stating: *\"Thus, those who act in accordance with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who embody virtue are one with virtue.\"* This is the meaning of \"vast and great virtue.\" Other texts mistakenly write *\"有熊\"* (\"Youxiong\"), likely a graphical error, as *Youxiong* lacks the connotation of \"vast and great virtue.\" Moreover, the *Liezi* records the Yellow Emperor’s journey to the land of Huaxu, repeatedly stating *\"自然而已\"* (\"merely natural\"), confirming that *Ziran* (Naturally) was the Yellow Emperor’s title for ruling the world.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Song’s interpretation may not be definitive. However, since ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi have been paired, as in the *Lunheng·Ziran*: *\"Huang refers to the Yellow Emperor; Lao refers to Laozi.\"* Both the Yellow Emperor and Laozi revered *ziran* (naturalness). The *Lunheng* cites the *\"Song of Striking the Earth\"*:\n*\"The sun rises, and I work;\nThe sun sets, and I rest.\nI dig a well to drink,\nI till the fields to eat—\nWhat power does the emperor hold over me?\"*\nThis is the essence of *ziran* (naturalness), which Laozi upheld. In Chapter 25: *\"Man models himself on earth, earth on heaven, heaven on the Dao, and the Dao on ziran (naturalness).\"* In Chapter 51: *\"Nothing commands it, yet it is constantly ziran (natural).\"* In Chapter 23: *\"Sparse words are ziran (natural).\"* In Chapter 64: *\"To assist the self-transformation of the myriad things without daring to act.\"* From these passages, it is clear that Laozi’s teachings ultimately culminate in *ziran* (naturalness). Thus, the *Lunheng·Hantian* states: *\"The Dao of heaven is ziran (natural); ziran (naturalness) is non-action.\"* The *Qian’gao* states: *\"The schools of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi discuss the Dao of heaven and grasp its essence.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang’s *Rhyme Readings* groups:\n- *誉* (praise) and *侮* (disdain) as rhymes (the *yu* and *yu* rhymes intermingle; *誉* is a rising tone, *侮* rhymes with *武*),\n- *焉* (thereupon), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes (the *yuan* rhyme group).\n\nQian Zhi notes: *誉* belongs to the *yu* rhyme group, *侮* to the *yu* group, with *yu* and *yu* intermingling. Karlgren groups *信* (trust), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes. Chen Zhu groups the four *\"之\"* as rhymes, and *有* (have), *誉* (praise), *畏* (fear), *侮* (disdain) as rhymes, with *焉* (thereupon), *焉* (thereupon), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes. *誉* is phonetically linked to *与* (with), and *与* and *以* (by) were anciently interchangeable. *侮* is linked to *每* (each), and *每* to *母* (mother).\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version contains 38 characters; the *Dunhuang* version matches it. The *Heshang Gong* version has 40 characters, Wang Bi’s and Fan Yingyuan’s 44, and Fu’s 47. The *Heshang Gong* titles this chapter *\"Pure Wind, Seventeenth,\"* Wang Bi’s *\"Chapter Seventeen,\"* and Fan Yingyuan’s *\"The Supreme, Chapter Seventeenth.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the great Dao declines, *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) arise.\nWhen *zhi* (wisdom) and *hui* (discernment) emerge, great falsity appears.\n\nYan Kejun notes: Most versions read *\"仁义\"* (\"benevolence and righteousness\"), while Wang Bi writes *\"智慧\"* (\"wisdom and discernment\"), with some variants as *\"慧知\"* (\"discernment and knowledge\"), which is incorrect.\n\nYan Hongxuan states: *\"When* zhi *and* hui *emerge, great falsity appears\"*—Hongxuan notes that *\"hui\"* should be written as *\"hui\"* (discernment). The *Shiwen* edition reads *\"zhihui\"* (knowledge and discernment). The *Shuowen* states: *\"Hui* (惠) means benevolence, composed of 'heart' and '○'.\"* *\"Hui* (慧) means cleverness, composed of 'heart' and phonetic *hui* (彗).\"* *\"Hui\"* (惠) and *\"hui\"* (慧) are not the same. In the *Analects*, *Wei Ling Gong* chapter, *\"fond of practicing petty cleverness,\"* the *Shiwen* notes: *\"The Lu pronunciation reads* hui *as* hui.\" This is a case of loan characters.\n\nJi Yun remarks: *\"Hui* (慧) and *hui* (惠) were interchangeable in antiquity.\" Qian Zhi notes: *\"Fei* (癈) should be written as *fei* (废).\" The *Jinglong* and *Guangming* editions both write *\"fei\"* (癈). The *Zijian* states: *\"Fei* (废), pronounced *fang fei*, means 'a collapsed house' in the *Shuowen*, distinct from the character for disability.\" Also, *\"ren yi\"* (人义) should follow other editions as *\"ren yi\"* (仁义). The *Zhuangzi*, *Ma Ti* chapter, states: *\"When the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why seek benevolence and righteousness?\"*—this is derived from here.\n\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony, filial piety and compassion arise.\n\nYan Kejun states: *\"Xiao ci\"* (孝慈), the *Dayian* edition writes *\"xiao zi\"* (孝子). Luo Zhenyu remarks: In these three phrases—after *\"fei\"* (废), *\"chu\"* (出), and *\"he\"* (和)—the *Guangming* edition includes the character *\"yan\"* (焉). Below, *\"When the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear,\"* after *\"luan\"* (乱), there must also have been a *\"yan\"* (焉), though the stone is too worn to confirm. Qian Zhi notes: The *Shichu* edition includes *\"yan\"* (焉), matching the *Guangming*, and also has *\"yan\"* (焉) after *\"luan\"* (乱).\n\n*\"Six relations\"*—Wang Bi’s commentary: *\"Father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife.\"* The *Lüshi Chunqiu*, *Lun Ren* chapter, asks: *\"What are the six kin?\"* and answers: *\"Father and mother, elder and younger brothers, wife and children.\"* The interpretation of *\"xiao ci\"* (孝慈) as two characters is correct. The *Zuozhuan*, *Zhao* 25th year, *Zhengyi*, and the *Shijing*, *Xiaoya Caiqi*, *Kong Yingda Zhengyi*, cite the *Laozi* with added and misordered characters, but the two characters *\"xiao ci\"* (孝慈) match this stele.\n\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying Xun*, cites this phrase identically. The Fan edition reads *\"loyal and steadfast ministers\"* with the character *\"zhen\"* (贞), matching Wang Bi’s edition. Minagawa Kien’s edition writes *\"loyal and trustworthy\"* (忠信), pairing it with the above *\"filial piety and compassion\"* (孝慈). Also, the character *\"hun\"* (昏): the Song-printed *Heshang Gong* edition, Zhao Mengfu’s edition, and Lou Zheng’s edition write it as *\"𣅔\"*, while the *Dunhuang*, *Suichuan*, various Wang editions, Fu, and Fan editions all write *\"hun\"* (昏). The *Shuowen* states: *\"Hun* (昏) means 'darkness at dusk,' composed of 'sun' and a reduced *di* (氐); one says it is phonetic *min* (民).\"* Duan Yucai’s *Kuangmiu* cites Dai Tong’s *Liu Shu Gu*: *\"The Tang edition of the* Shuowen *uses a reduced* min *(民), while Xu’s edition uses a reduced* shi *(氏). Chao Yuezhi said this was because the Tang tabooed* min *and changed it to* shi. *Thus, the original* Shuowen *wrote* 𣅔*, composed of 'sun' and phonetic* min *(民). The Tang edition, to avoid the taboo, reduced one stroke, hence 'composed of a reduced* min'.\"* Ding Zhongyou states: *\"Examining Han steles,* 𣅔 *is the standard character,* hun *a variant. ... The* Old Tang Book*, *Gaozong Ji*, records that in the twelfth month of Xianqing 2, the character* 𣅔 *was changed to* hun *(昏). From this, we know* 𣅔 *was altered to the variant* hun *to avoid the temple name taboo. Observing pre-Xianqing Wei steles, all* 𣅔 *use* min *(民), while post-Xianqing Tang steles, to avoid the taboo, all write* hun *(昏).\"* (*Shuowen Jiezi Gulin*, *Chen Ji*, *Ri* section)\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du*, has no rhyme. Yao Wentian: *\"Yi* (义) and *wei* (伪) rhyme (eleven *ma* departing tone).\" Deng Tingzhen: *\"Fei* (废) and *chu* (出) also rhyme.\" Deng states: *\"Chu* (出) in ancient pronunciation reads like *Yi Ding*’s *Chu Liu* (鼎颠趾, 利出否) *chu* (出). *Wei* (伪) in ancient pronunciation reads like *e* (讹). The* Shangshu*, *Yao Dian*, reads *ping zhe nan e* (平秩南讹), while the* Hanshu*, *Wang Mang Zhuan*, writes *nan wei* (南伪).\" Gao Buhan: *\"Fei* (废), *yi* (义), *chu* (出), and *wei* (伪) rhyme in alternating lines; *luan* (乱) and *chen* (臣) rhyme.\" Qian Zhi notes: *\"Yi* (义) in antiquity was universally pronounced *e* (俄). The* Hong Fan *reads *wu pian wu po, zun wang zhi yi* (无偏无颇，遵王之义), and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang changed *po* (颇) to *bei* (陂). His edict briefly states: *'I have pondered this phrase thrice and always found it grounded. According to the following text, all rhyme, except for* po *(颇), which truly disrupts the harmony. It should be changed to* bei *(陂).'* Wu Yu states: *'The ancient character* yi *(义) was universally pronounced* e *(俄). The* Zhouli *commentary also reads* e *(俄). Thus, the ancient* Shangshu *wrote* wu pian wu po, zun wang zhi yi *(无偏无颇，遵王之义) to rhyme with* e *(俄). Emperor Ming of Tang, taking* yi *(义) in modern pronunciation as* yi *(乂), changed* po *(颇) to* bei *(陂) to conform to modern pronunciation, and the ancient pronunciation was thus lost.' Now, evidence from the* Yi*: *'The cauldron’s handle is altered, losing its* yi *(义); the duke’s gruel is overturned—how trustworthy is that?' The* Zhongyong *states: *'Ren* (仁) *is humanity;* yi *(义) is appropriateness.' From this, we know that in this chapter of the* Laozi*,* yi *(义) should also be pronounced* e *(俄). As for* wei *(伪), the* Zhuangzi*, *Zhi Beiyou*, states: *'Ren* (仁) *can be enacted,* yi *(义) can be diminished, and ritual is mutual falsity.'* Wei *(伪) also belongs to the* ge *rhyme group, rhyming with* wei *(为) and* kui *(亏). Gu Yanwu states: *'The* Shijing *reads* min zhi e yan *(民之讹言), while the Stone Classics write* wei yan *(伪言). The* Hanshu*, *Wang Mang Zhuan*, reads* yi nan wei *(以劝南伪), and Yan Shigu notes: 'Read as* e *(讹).' Guo Pu’s* Fangyan *commentary reads* wei yan e *(伪言讹).' From this, we know* yi *(义) and* wei *(伪) rhyme. Ma Xulun’s* Maoshi Zhengyun Houxu *states: *'In this chapter,* da *(大),* zhi *(智),* liu *(六), and* guo *(国) rhyme at the beginning of the upper lines, while* fei *(废),* chu *(出),* he *(和), and* luan *(乱) rhyme at the end of the upper lines.'\"\n\nMoreover, it is not merely that *yi* (义) and *wei* (伪) serve as rhymes at the ends of lines.\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains twenty-six characters; the Dunhuang, He [Shangong], and Wang [Bi] versions are the same. The Fu [Yi] version has twenty-eight characters, and the Fan [Yingyuan] version thirty. The He Shangong version titles this \"Vulgar Shallowness, Chapter Eighteen,\" the Wang [Bi] version \"Chapter Eighteen,\" and the Fan [Yingyuan] version \"The Chapter on the Abandonment of the Great Dao, Eighteen.\"\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold;\nJi Yun notes: The *Yongle Dadian* places the two lines \"Abandon sagacity\" after the two lines \"Abandon benevolence.\"\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Suizhou version writes *min* (民) as *ren* (人), likely to avoid the Tang taboo.\nWei Jiasun notes: In the imperial commentary, \"wisdom\" (*zhi*, 智) is written as \"knowledge\" (*zhi*, 知) for the phrase \"Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom.\"\nQian [Zhi] observes: The Suizhou, Fu [Yi], and Fan [Yingyuan] versions also write \"knowledge\" (*zhi*, 知); the Fan version writes \"discard\" (*qi*, 弃) as *qi* (弃), and the next two lines follow suit. The *Zhuangzi*, *Qu Qie* chapter, reads: \"Thus, abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and great thieves will cease\"; the *Zai You* chapter reads: \"Abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and the world will be greatly ordered\"—both write \"knowledge\" (*zhi*, 知). The *Huainanzi*, *Dao Ying Xun*, cites the *Laozi* as writing \"wisdom\" (*zhi*, 智).\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion;\nAbandon skill, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will be no more.\nYan Kejun states: \"Abandon benevolence\" (*jue ren*, 绝仁) appears as \"abandon the people\" (*jue min*, 绝民) in all other versions.\nQian [Zhi] observes: The character *min* (民) is an error arising from the repetition of *min* in the surrounding text.\nThese three, being insufficient as cultural adornments, thus necessitate attachment to something else.\nWei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary includes the character *yi* (以) before \"being\" (*wei*, 为).\nLuo Zhenyu states: Neither the Jinglong nor Jingfu versions include the character *yi* (以).\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Suizhou version reads \"These three sayings are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san zhe yan wei*, 此三者言为), the Jing version \"These three are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san zhe wei*, 此三者为), and the Dunhuang version \"These three sayings are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san yan wei*, 此三言为).\nQian [Zhi] observes: The Fan version omits the character *ci* (此); the Fu version writes \"insufficient\" (*bu zu*, 不足) as \"not yet\" (*wei zu*, 未足); the Fu and Fan versions include the character *ye* (也) after \"sufficient\" (*zu*, 足). Furthermore, the *Qunshu Zhiyao*, Volume 34, cites the line \"thieves and bandits will be no more\" and immediately follows with \"as cultural adornments are insufficient, manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" omitting the eight characters \"these three\" (*ci san zhe*, 此三者) and \"thus necessitate attachment to something else\" (*gu ling you suo shu*, 故令有所属). It is suspected that these were marginal notes mistakenly incorporated into the main text.\nYu Xingwu states: Now, *wei* (为) and *wei* (伪) were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Book of Documents*, *Yao Dian*, reads \"to regulate the southern *wei* (伪)\"; the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Annals of the Five Emperors*, writes \"southern *wei* (为).\" The *Record of Rites*, *Monthly Ordinances*, reads \"do not create excessive skill,\" with a note: \"In the current *Monthly Ordinances*, 'create' (*zuo wei*, 作为) is written as 'deceitful *wei*' (*zha wei*, 诈伪).\" \"Cultural adornment\" (*wen*, 文) should be read as in the *Xunzi*, *Ruxiao*: \"select what is correct and adorn it\" (*qu shi er wen zhi ye*, 取是而文之也)—*wen* means \"to embellish.\" \"These three\" refers to sagacity and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness, skill and profit. \"With deceit, embellish what is insufficient\" (*yi wei wen bu zu*, 以伪文不足) means to use deceit to embellish what is lacking. The following lines, \"thus necessitate attachment to something else, manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" all indicate that one should not engage in deceitful embellishment. Abandon it there and attach it here—this is the original meaning of the *Laozi*.\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires.\nQian [Zhi] observes: The character *pu* (朴) in the He Shangong, Gu [Yanwu], and Fan [Yingyuan] versions matches this stele. The Wang Bi and Fu Yi versions write *pu* (朴), while the imperial commentary writes *pu* (扑).\nBi Yuan states: \"*Pu* (朴) is sometimes written as *pu* (朴)—both are the same.\"\nLiu Shipei states: Now, *si* (私) should be written as *si* (思). The *Hanfeizi*, *Jie Lao* chapter, reads: \"All virtue is gathered through non-action, completed through desirelessness, stabilized through non-thinking, and solidified through non-use.\" \"Thinking\" (*si*, 思) and \"desire\" (*yu*, 欲) are mentioned together. Furthermore, the *Wen Xuan*, Li Shan’s commentary on Xie Lingyun’s *Fangshan* poem, cites the *Laozi*: \"Reduce thinking, diminish desires.\" This is evidence that the ancient text wrote *si* (思), which explains \"reduce thinking\" here.\nQian [Zhi] observes: *Si* (私) was originally written as *si* (思). The Tang-era *Wang Zhen Lun Bing Yao Yi Shu*, the *Qiang Si Qi* version, the Song-era Chen Xianggu version, and the Yuan-era *Da De San Nian* stele at the Panxi Palace in Baoji County, Shaanxi, all write *si* (思) instead of *si* (私)—this is the evidence. Only the *Zhuangzi*, *Shan Mu* chapter, reads: \"Their people are foolish and simple, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" matching this stele. The He Shangong commentary on \"reduce selfishness\" states: \"Truly without selfishness,\" which aligns with the meaning of Chapter Seven of the *Laozi*: \"Is it not because they are without selfishness that they can perfect their selfishness?\" Interpreting the *Laozi* with the *Laozi* itself, we know that Liu’s theory, while plausible, cannot be taken as definitive.\n\n**Phonology**\nFor this chapter, Jiang [Yong]’s *Rhyming Readings* groups the rhymes as follows: *bei* (倍), *ci* (慈), and *you* (有) (in the *zhi* 部, with *bei* pronounced as *pi*, and *ci* in the falling tone). *Zu* (足), *shu* (属), *pu* (朴), and *yu* (欲) rhyme (in the *hou* 部). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur. Gao Heng argues that the line \"Abandon learning and have no worries\" should belong to this chapter, rhyming *zu* (足), *shu* (属), *pu* (朴), *yu* (欲), and *you* (忧). Now, *you* (忧) belongs to the *you* 部, which harmonizes with the *hou* 部. Deng Tingzhen states: *Bei* (倍), *ci* (慈), and *you* (有) form a rhyme. Characters with the sounds *sheng* (声), *zi* (兹), and *you* (有) were classified under the *zhi* 部 in ancient phonology. The *Shijing*, *Zhan Ang*, reads: \"Like a merchant’s threefold profit,\" rhyming with \"women have no public affairs.\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains forty-four characters; the Dunhuang version is the same. The He [Shangong], Wang [Bi], and Fan [Yingyuan] versions have forty-five characters, while the Fu [Yi] version has forty-seven. The He Shangong version titles this \"Returning to Simplicity,\" the Wang [Bi] version \"Chapter Nineteen,\" and the Fan [Yingyuan] version \"The Chapter on Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom, Nineteen.\"\n\nChapter Twenty: Abandon Learning and Be Without Care\n\nYi Shunding states: The *Wenzi* cites \"Abandon learning and be without care\" above \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom,\" suggesting the ancient text was thus arranged. This aligns with the three instances of \"abandon\" sharing the same meaning. Yet in the present version, it appears above the line \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery',\" where its meaning seems misplaced.\n\nMa Xulun says: The line \"Abandon learning and be without care\" should belong to the preceding chapter. He further notes: Chao Gongwu’s *Dushu Ji* cites the Minghuang edition, which also appends \"Abandon learning and be without care\" to the end of the former Chapter Nineteen.\n\nJiang Xichang argues: Judging by the text’s logic, this line should belong to the preceding chapter, serving as the conclusion to the passage \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom, abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, abandon cunning and discard profit.\"\n\nChao Gongwu’s *Junzhai Dushu Zhi* records that the Tang-era Zhang Junxiang’s *Thirty Commentaries on the Laozi* attaches \"Abandon learning and be without care\" to the end of the \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom\" chapter, treating \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery'\" as a separate chapter—a division differing from other versions, yet one that should be followed. Later, Gui Youguang and Yao Nai also assigned this chapter to the preceding one, which is correct.\n\nLi Dafang states: The line \"Abandon learning and be without care\" cannot be severed and assigned to the following chapter. For the three lines—\"Manifest plainness and embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness and diminish desire, abandon learning and be without care\"—follow the preceding sentence \"These three, as literary expressions, are insufficient, hence they are given something to belong to.\" \"Manifest plainness and embrace simplicity\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning benevolence\"; \"reduce selfishness and diminish desire\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning cunning\"; and \"abandon learning and be without care\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning sagacity.\" The line \"These three, as literary expressions, are insufficient\" summarizes the preceding text, while \"hence they are given something to belong to\" introduces what follows. The structure is clear, leaving no room for doubt.\n\nOnly \"yes\" and \"flattery\"—how far apart are they?\nGoodness and evil—how distant are they?\n\nWu Cheng says: Both \"yes\" (*wei*) and \"flattery\" (*a*) are responsive sounds—*wei* is upright and compliant, while *a* is devious and obsequious. \"How far apart\" (*jihe*) means they are not far removed from each other.\n\nLiu Shipei argues: *A* should be written as *he* (呵). The *Shuowen* states: \"He: to speak loudly in anger.\" The *Guangya Shigu* defines *he* as \"anger.\" The vulgar form of *he* is *he* (呵). The *Hanshu Shihuo Zhi* reads: \"Bound yet not rebuked,\" with Yan Shigu’s note: \"To reproach in anger.\" Thus, *wei* is an affirmative response, while *he* is a word of reproach. Human anger arises from what one rejects, so Laozi, to rhyme with *he* below, substitutes *he* for *fou* (否). \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery'\" thus means \"compliance and opposition.\"\n\nWu Nei Yixiong states: The Dunhuang and Suizhou versions write \"good\" (*shan*) as \"beauty\" (*mei*).\n\nYi Shunding says: The Wang Bi edition reads \"beauty and evil—how distant are they,\" matching the Fu Yi version. The commentary notes: \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery,' beauty and evil—how distant are they,\" confirming this. The current text’s \"how distant\" (*ruohe*) is not the original Wang Bi reading.\n\nJiang Xichang says: Gu Huan’s *Chengshi* commentary glosses \"compliance as beauty, opposition as evil,\" indicating Cheng wrote *mei* (beauty). In Chapter Two, \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, this is evil,\" both instances pair beauty and evil. The Fu Yi version writes *shan* (good) as *mei* (beauty), which should be followed. Here, *a*, *he*, *e* (evil), and *ruo* (distant) form a rhyme; the received texts’ \"how distant\" (*ruohe*) should be amended to \"distant how\" (*he ruo*), which should also be adopted.\n\nYan Kejun says: \"How distant are they\" (*xiang qu he ruo*)—Wang Bi may have written \"distant how\" (*ruo he*), which is incorrect.\n\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared.\n\nSun Kuang’s *Gu Jin Ben Kao Zheng* notes: \"Cannot\" (*bu ke*) is also written as \"dare not\" (*bu gan*).\n\nQian Zhi observes: The *Huainanzi Dao Ying Xun* cites the preceding two lines, matching this stele.\n\nVast and boundless, its end not yet reached!\n\nWei Jiasun says: Between \"vast\" (*mang*) and \"its\" (*qi*), the original has a blank space—either awaiting carving, an error in chapter division, or a strict adherence to line spacing. Later, between the two \"pure\" (*chun*) characters, there is also a gap, following the example of the first line on the stele’s reverse. It is suspected that due to a flaw in the stone, the text was written continuously, and the space after *mang* was left intact.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The blank after *mang* is neither a damaged character nor a chapter division but likely an uncarved *xi* (兮).\n\nYan Kejun says: The *Yu Zhu* edition writes \"vast\" (*huang*) as *mang*. The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include *xi* (兮) after *huang* and *zai* (哉) at the end of the sentence.\n\nWu Yun says: The Xing edition writes *huang* (荒) as *mang* (莽).\n\nWang Lanquan suspects it is a corruption of *huang*.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Guangming and Muromachi editions write *huang*, while the stele writes *mang*. *Mang* is interchangeable with *mang* (茫), actually *mang* (芒), borrowed for *huang* (荒), the modern *mang* (茫). The *Shijing Chang Fa* reads: \"The great waters, vast and boundless,\" and the *Xuan Niao* reads: \"Dwelling in the Yin lands, vast and boundless,\" with the *Zhuan* glossing it as \"a great appearance.\" The *Zuozhuan Xiang Si* reads: \"The distant traces of Yu, vast and boundless,\" with the note: \"A distant appearance.\" The *Huainanzi Chu Zhen* reads: \"Its Dao, vast and obscure,\" with the note: \"A broad and great appearance.\" The *Tan Shi Fu* reads: \"Why gaze at the heavens, so vast and boundless,\" with the note: \"Like *mengmeng* (梦梦).\" The *Zhuangzi Da Zong Shi* reads: \"Vast and wandering beyond the dust and grime,\" with the *Shiwen* glossing it as \"a boundless appearance.\" The Suizhou stele writes *mang* (莽), likely because \"grass grows deep\" is called *mang*, sharing with *mang* the sense of vast, boundless, and distant.\n\nThe *Xiao Er Ya Guang Yu* states: \"Mang (莽) means great.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu Zhi Jie* reads: \"Why is it so *mangmang* (莽莽)?\" with the note: \"An appearance of great length.\" The *Zhuangzi Xiaoyaoyou* reads: \"Those who travel to the *mangcang* (莽苍),\" with Cui’s annotation: \"The color of the wild grasslands.\" The meanings of *mang* (忙), *mang* (莽), and *huang* (荒) are closely related.\n\n\"All people bustle joyfully, as if partaking in a grand feast.\" Ma Xulun notes: \"*Xi* (熙) is a loan character for *xi* (媐).\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Xi* (媐) means joyful delight.\" Qian Zhi observes: \"*Xixi* (熙熙) here shares the same meaning as *xi* (熙) in the *Zhuangzi Ma Ti* chapter: 'chewing their food and *xi* (熙),' and in the *Liezi Yang Zhu* chapter: '*xixi* (熙熙) while awaiting death.'\" *Xixi* (熙熙) is equivalent to *xixi* (嘻嘻). The *Shu Chao* (Vol. 15) cites the *Zhuangzi* with *xi* (熙) written as *xi* (嘻), while the *Chuxue Ji* (Vol. 9) and *Shiwen Leiju* (Posterior Collection, Vol. 20) both write it as *xi* (嬉). The *Yanzi Chunqiu* (Vol. 6) originally reads: \"The sage is not one to *xi* (嬉) with.\" *Xi* (熙), *xi* (嘻), and *xi* (嬉) share the same meaning; thus, \"all people *xixi* (熙熙)\" is to say all people *xixi* (嘻嘻).\n\nYan Kejun states: \"'As if partaking in a grand feast'—*lao* () is a variant character.\" The imperial commentary writes \"as if feasting (*ru xiang* 如享),\" while the *Shiwen* writes \"as if boiling (*ruo heng* 若亨),\" citing the *Heshang Gong* version as \"as if offering (*xiang* 飨).\" Qian Zhi notes: The Suizhou edition mistakenly writes \"grand minister (*da zai* 大宰)\" instead of \"grand feast (*tai lao* 太牢).\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (Vol. 3) cites the *Heshang Gong* version as \"as if feasting (*ruo xiang* 若享),\" while the *Yuzhu Baodian* (Vol. 3) cites it as \"and feasting (*er xiang* 而飨).\" Takeuchi Yoshio states: \"As if boiling a grand feast (*ruo heng tai lao* 若亨太牢)\"—the Wang Bi edition writes *heng* (亨), which Lu Deming reads as \"boiling (*peng* 烹).\" The *Heshang Gong* reads it as \"feasting (*xiang* 享)\" and further alters *heng* (亨) to *xiang* (飨). Current editions of the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions both write \"feasting (*xiang* 享).\" The *Yuzhu Baodian* (Vol. 3) cites this passage as \"feasting (*xiang* 飨),\" aligning with Lu’s citation of the *Heshang Gong* version. Thus, the single character *heng* (亨) has been variously interpreted, leading to divergent versions of the text.\n\n\"Like ascending a terrace in spring.\" Yan Kejun states: The imperial commentary and Wang Bi edition write \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台),\" while the *Heshang Gong* writes \"like ascending a spring terrace (*ru deng chun tai* 如登春台).\" Bi Yuan notes: \"Like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台)\"—the Wang Bi and Gu Huan editions both concur, as do the Tang *Minghuang* edition and the Yizhou stone inscriptions. The *Daozang* edition published in the tenth year of the Zhengtong reign (1445) of the Ming dynasty first erroneously writes \"ascending a spring terrace (*deng chun tai* 登春台),\" followed by the Lu Xisheng and Wang Zhen editions, and now all popular editions replicate this error. Additionally, Li Shan’s commentary on the *Xianju Fu* also errs in this regard.\n\nYu Yue states: The phrase \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台)\" follows the same structure as the fifteenth chapter’s \"like fording a river in winter (*ruo dong she chuan* 若冬涉川).\" The *Heshang Gong* version, \"like ascending a spring terrace (*ru deng chun tai* 如登春台),\" is incorrect. However, its commentary states: \"In spring, Yin and Yang interact, and the myriad things are stirred; ascending a terrace to observe them, one’s will is deeply moved.\" This suggests that the commentary did not originally treat \"spring terrace\" as a single phrase. The edition it relied upon must have read \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台),\" and the present transmission has merely inverted the characters.\n\nJiang Xichang states: The *Daode Zhenjing Xuande Zuan Shu* by Tang scholar Qiang Siqui cites the *Heshang Gong* version of the text as \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台),\" which precisely matches the Song *Heshang Gong* edition. Yu Yue’s assertion that the *Heshang Gong* edition must have originally read \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台)\" is correct. The *Cheng* commentary in the Gu edition states: \"And like ascending a terrace in spring (*you ru chun ri deng tai* 又如春日登台),\" indicating that Cheng also wrote \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台).\" ...The Wang Bi edition, *Heshang Gong* edition, and various stone inscriptions all write \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台).\" This appears to be the ancient version, and it seems unwarranted to arbitrarily alter it based on later editions.\n\nThe character \"like\" (*ru* 如) should follow the stele edition’s \"as if\" (*ruo* 若) to maintain parallelism with the preceding sentence. The *Shiwen* writes \"as if\" (*ruo* 若) in the previous sentence, and this should be consistent.\n\nMy *po* unmanifested—\n\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* reads \"I alone fear its unmanifestation\" (*wo du pa qi wei zhao* 我獨怕其未兆), while the *Heshang Gong* edition has \"I alone fear, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du pa xi qi wei zhao* 我獨怕兮其未兆). The *Shiwen* writes \"vast\" (*kuo* 廓), citing *Heshang Gong* as \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊). Fu Yi’s edition reads \"My *po* alone, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du po xi qi wei zhao* 我獨魄兮其未兆), and the *Dayian* edition has \"I, tranquil, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo bo xi qi wei zhao* 我泊兮其未兆). Wang’s edition, citing the Xingzhou version, matches this. Lu Wenchang states: The modern text reads \"I alone, tranquil, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du bo xi qi wei zhao* 我獨泊兮其未兆), while Wang Bi’s edition writes \"vast\" (*kuo* 廓) for \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), and the Zang edition has \"fear\" (*pa* 怕). The *Shuowen* states: \"Fear (*pa* 怕) means non-action.\" The Zang edition is correct. Now Wang Bi’s edition writes \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), while the ancient editions have \"*po*\" (*po* 魄). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jingfu* and *Yinglun* editions both read \"fear\" (*pa* 怕). Hong Yixuan comments: \"I alone fear, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du pa xi qi wei zhao* 我獨怕兮其未兆), with *Heshang Gong*’s annotation: \"I alone am fearfully still, without the manifest signs of quiet desires.\" Yixuan observes: The *Shuowen* defines \"fear\" (*pa* 怕) as \"non-action, from the heart, pronounced *bai*,\" its meaning derived from this. Vulgar editions write the character \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), which is incorrect. Qian Zhi notes: The modern text’s \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊) and \"*po*\" (*po* 魄) share a phonetic gloss. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the biography of Li Yiji, writes \"fallen and *po*\" (*luo po* 落魄) as \"fallen and tranquil\" (*luo bo* 落泊). Similarly, \"tiger *po*\" (*hu po* 虎魄) is written as \"amber\" (*hu po* 珀). The *Guoyu*, in the *Jin Yu*, states: \"Its *po* is manifest among the people,\" with Wei Zhao’s annotation: \"Manifest (*zhao* 兆) means visible.\" Here, \"my *po* unmanifested\" (*wo po wei zhao* 我魄未兆) conveys the meaning of fear in non-action. Like an infant yet to laugh.\n\nYan Kejun states: All editions read \"like an infant yet to laugh\" (*ru ying er zhi wei hai* 如嬰兒之未孩). Bi Yuan notes: *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi write \"like\" (*ru* 如) as \"as if\" (*ruo* 若). The character \"laugh\" (*hai* 咳) is written as \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) in *Heshang Gong*. The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: \"Laugh (*hai* 咳) is the seal script form of infant (*hai* 孩).\" The ancient scripts are identical. Lao Jian comments: \"Like an infant yet to laugh\" (*ru ying er zhi wei ke* 如嬰兒之未咳), the character \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) appears as \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) in the *Jinglong* and *Kaiyuan* editions. Fu, Fan, and *Jingfu* editions, along with the *Shiwen*, all write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). Fan’s annotation: \"Laugh (*ke* 咳), pronounced *he lai*. Zhang Xuanjing’s edition matches the ancient version.\" The *Jiyun* universally writes \"infant\" (*hai* 孩). Note that \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) is the ancient form of \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). Qian Zhi notes: The *Shuowen*’s section on \"child\" lacks the character \"infant\" (*hai* 孩), which appears under the \"mouth\" section for \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). The *Guangyun* defines \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) as \"a newborn child\" and \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) as \"a child’s laughter,\" both pronounced *hu lai*. The *Leipian* states: \"Infant (*hai* 孩) and laugh (*ke* 咳) are the same, meaning a child’s laughter.\" \"Infant\" (*hai* 孩) and \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) were originally one character. Fu and Fan’s editions write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳), with identical pronunciation and meaning. The *Shiwen* includes the character \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳), indicating Wang’s edition wrote \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). The *Jingfu* and *Shimachō* editions also write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳).\n\nAdrift, as if with no place to return!\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* includes the characters \"ah, like\" (*xi ruo* 兮若) after \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘). Wang Bi’s edition reads \"weary, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi ruo wu suo gui* 儽儽兮若無所歸). Qian Zhi notes: Fu Yi’s edition reads \"weary, ah, its insufficiency, with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi qi bu zu yi wu suo gui* 儡儡兮其不足以無所歸), while Fan’s edition has \"weary, ah, as if insufficient, seemingly with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi qi ruo bu zu si wu suo gui* 儽儽兮其若不足似無所歸). The Suzhou and Gu Huan editions read \"stalwart, with no place to return\" (*kui wu suo gui* 魁無所歸). The *Jingfu*, *Louzheng*, *Xingxuan*, *Panxi*, and *Yinglun* editions all write \"adrift, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*cheng cheng xi ruo wu suo gui* 乘乘兮若無所歸). Zhu Junsheng states: In the *Shuowen*, \"weary\" (*lei* 儽) means \"a drooping appearance. Also said to mean lazy and slack, from *ren* 人 and *lei* 累 phonetic.\" It differs slightly from \"weary\" (*lei* 儡). The character is also written as \"weary\" (*lei* 儽), and is mistakenly written as \"○.\" The *Guangya*, in *Shigu* 2, states: \"○ means labor.\" The *Shi Xun* reads: \"○○ means fatigue.\" In the *Laozi*, \"○○, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*○○兮若無所歸*), the *Shiwen* annotates: \"Defeated, also scattered.\" *Heshang Gong*’s edition writes \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘), an error for \"drooping\" (*chui chui* 垂垂). Takeuchi Yoshio states: Wang’s edition reads \"weary, ah\" (*lei lei xi* 儽儽兮), while the old manuscript *Heshang Gong* has \"weary, ah\" (*lei lei xi* 儡儡兮), and the *Jinglong* stele writes \"adrift, ah\" (*cheng cheng xi* 乘乘兮). Since \"weary\" (*lei* 儽) and \"weary\" (*lei* 儡) share the same sound, and the *Shuowen* defines \"weary, weary\" (*lei lei* 儽儽) as \"a drooping appearance,\" it does not align with \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘) in sound or meaning. I suspect \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘) is a corruption of \"drooping\" (*chui chui* 垂垂). If so, *Heshang Gong*’s edition originally wrote \"weary, weary\" (*lei lei* 儡儡), and its gloss interprets it as the character \"droop\" (*chui* 垂).\n\nAll people have abundance; I alone seem lacking.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* includes the character \"yet\" (*er* 而) before \"I\" (*wo* 我). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong* and *Imperial Commentary* editions both omit \"yet\" (*er* 而). Xi Tong states: \"Lacking\" (*yi* 遺) is borrowed for \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱), meaning inadequacy. The *Liji*, in the *Ji Yi*, reads \"and in old age, not lacking\" (*er qiong lao bu yi* 而窮老不遺), with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Lacking (*yi* 遺) is written as insufficient (*kui* 匱),\" which serves as evidence. Yu Xingwu states: \"Lacking\" (*yi* 遺) should be read as \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱). Both characters rhyme with *gui* 貴, and their sounds are close, making them interchangeable. ...The *Guangya*, in *Shigu*, states: \"Insufficient (*kui* 匱) means increase.\" Wang Niansun argues that \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱) should be \"lacking\" (*yi* 遺), as \"lacking\" has the sense of increase, while \"insufficient\" does not. The *Liji*, in the *Yue Ji*, reads \"its resources insufficient\" (*qi cai kui* 其財匱), with the *Shiwen* annotating: \"Insufficient (*kui* 匱) means lacking.\" \"All people have abundance, yet I alone seem insufficient\" (*zhong ren jie you yu er wo du ruo kui* 衆人皆有餘而我獨若匱) contrasts \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱) with \"abundance\" (*yu* 餘) as parallel phrases. Previous interpreters have all read \"lacking\" (*yi* 遺) literally, forcing an explanation of loss.\n\nMy heart is that of a fool—so muddled.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi include the characters \"also, alas\" (*ye zai* 也哉) after \"heart\" (*xin* 心). For \"muddled\" (*chun chun* 純純), *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi write \"chaotic, ah\" (*dun dun xi* 沌沌兮), with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Chaotic (*dun* 沌) is also written as *tun* 忳.\"\n\nBì Yuǎn states: Wang Bi follows *Heshang Gong* in writing \"pure\" (*chún* 纯), and the text of Sū Língzhī also reads \"pure.\" The reading \"pure\" is correct. Lù Démíng notes: \"Originally also written as *tún* 忳.\" Yet both \"chaotic\" (*dùn* 沌) and *tún* 忳 are incorrect.\n\nQiān Zhī observes: The reading \"pure\" (*chún* 纯) is correct. The *Yi Jing*'s *Wen Yan* states, \"Pure and refined is essence\" (*chún cuì jīng yě* 纯粹精也), with Cuī Jìn’s commentary: \"Unmixed is called pure\" (*bù zá yuē chún* 不杂曰纯). The *Huainanzi*'s *Yaolüe* reads, \"Not cleaved or divided, pure and uncarved\" (*bù pōu pàn chún pǔ* 不剖判纯朴), with the annotation: \"Pure and uncarved is primordial simplicity\" (*chún pǔ tài sù yě* 纯朴，太素也). The stele edition writes \"pure, pure\" (*chún chún* 纯纯), while the Muromachi edition has \"chaotic, chaotic\" (*dùn dùn* 沌沌), though the meaning is the same. The *Zhuangzi*'s *Shan Mu* chapter states: \"Pure and constant, one is likened to madness\" (*chún chún cháng cháng nǎi bǐ yú kuáng* 纯纯常常，乃比于狂). Its *Zai You* chapter reads: \"Chaotic and undifferentiated, never departing for a lifetime\" (*hún hún dùn dùn zhōng shēn bù lí* 浑浑沌沌，终身不离). Thus, *chún chún* 纯纯 is the same as *dùn dùn* 沌沌. Péng Sǒng’s *Shiwen* notes: \"Lǐ reads *chún chún* 纯纯 literally, as a term for simplicity and desirelessness.\" His interpretation is sound.\n\nThe common people are bright and clear; I alone seem dim.\n\nYan Kejun states: Wang Bi writes \"I alone am dim-dim\" (*wú dú hūn hūn* 我独昏昏). Xi Di says: \"*Hūn hūn* 昏昏\" appears in all other editions as \"*ruò hūn* 若昏,\" but the syntax is discordant; here we follow Wang Bi’s version. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Zai You* chapter reads: \"The utmost extremity of the supreme Dao is dim and silent\" (*zhì dào zhī jí, hūn hūn mò mò* 至道之极，昏昏默默). Jiang Xichang says: Judging by the meaning of the text, the version with *hūn hūn* 昏昏 is correct. Below, Wang Bi’s commentary—\"without desire to act, muddled and unclear, as if knowing nothing\"—confirms that the ancient text of the *Laozi* read *hūn hūn* 昏昏, not *ruò hūn* 若昏. *Hūn hūn* 昏昏 is the opposite of *zhāo zhāo* 昭昭.\n\nThe common people are sharp and discerning; I alone am muddled and dull.\nJiao Hong says: \"*Zhāo zhāo* 昭昭\" and \"*chá chá* 察察\" originally appeared in the ancient text as \"*jiē zhāo zhāo* 皆昭昭\" and \"*jiē xiāo xiāo* 皆嚣嚣.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Fu [Yi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions read thus. Fan [Yingyuan] comments: \"Wang Bi’s version matches the ancient text, though later editions omit the character *jiē* 皆.\" This confirms that Wang Bi’s original text included *jiē* 皆. Furthermore, \"*mèn mèn* 闷闷\" appears in the Fu and Fan editions as \"*mǐn mǐn* 闵闵,\" with the character *ruò* 若 preceding both. Fan Yingyuan says: He Shangong and all other commentators write \"*mèn mèn* 闷闷,\" which is phonetically identical. Han Yu’s *Ancient Rhapsody* contains the line: \"Alone and sorrowful, when will it end? I rely on my writings to express myself\" (*dú mǐn mǐn qí hé yǐ xī, píng wén zhāng yǐ zì xuān* 独闵闵其曷已兮，凭文章以自宣). Examining the character *mǐn mǐn* 闵闵 here, the annotation notes: \"One version writes *mèn mèn* 闷闷,\" which precisely matches this passage. We now follow the ancient text.\n\nVast like the sea,\nYan Kejun says: The *Imperial Commentary* writes \"*hū ruò huì* 忽若晦,\" He Shangong writes \"*hū xī ruò hǎi* 忽兮若海,\" Wang Bi writes \"*dàn xī qí ruò hǎi* 澹兮其若海,\" and the *Great Encyclopedia* writes \"*piāo hū* 漂乎,\" with another version reading \"*hū xī* 忽兮.\" Qian Zhi notes: Yan Zun’s edition writes \"*hū xī ruò huì* 忽兮若晦,\" the Fu [Yi] edition writes \"*dàn xī qí ruò hǎi* 淡兮其若海,\" the Fan [Yingyuan] edition writes \"*dàn xī ruò hǎi* 澹兮若海,\" the *Imperial Commentary* and the British Library edition both write \"*hū ruò huì* 忽若晦,\" while the Guangming, Jingfu, and Muromachi editions write \"*hū xī qí ruò hǎi* 忽兮其若海.\" Li Daochun says: \"'Vague like darkness' (*hū hū ruò huì* 忽乎若晦) or 'serene like the sea' (*dàn hū qí ruò hǎi* 淡乎其若海) are incorrect.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Wang [Bi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions correctly use the character *dàn* 澹. Wang Xizhi’s edition also writes *dàn* 澹, though the stele edition mistakenly writes *dàn* 淡. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Dàn* 澹 means water swaying; it is composed of the water radical and the phonetic *zhān* 詹.\" It is entirely distinct from *dàn* 淡. \"*Hǎi* 海\" sometimes appears as \"*huì* 晦,\" a loan character for *hǎi* 海. The *Kaoling Yao* of the *Book of Documents* states: \"The word *hǎi* 海 signifies dimness and obscurity, with nothing to be seen.\" The *Shiming*’s *Explanation of Water* says: \"*Hǎi* 海 means *huì* 晦: it receives filth and turbidity, its color black and obscure.\" *Hǎi* 海 and *huì* 晦 share the same meaning. This describes the boundless, unfathomable vastness of the sea.\n\nDrifting without end.\nYan Kejun says: The *Imperial Commentary* writes \"*jì xī sì wú suǒ zhǐ* 寂兮似无所止,\" He Shangong writes \"*piāo xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 漂兮若无所止,\" the *Shiwen* cites He Shangong as writing \"*yuān xī* 渊兮,\" Wang Bi writes \"*liù xī ruò wú zhǐ* 飂兮若无止,\" and Liang Jianwen and Fu Yi write \"*piāo xī* 飘兮.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Muromachi edition concurs. He Shangong and Wang Xizhi’s editions write \"*liù xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 飂兮若无所止,\" the Guangming edition writes \"*xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 兮若无所止,\" the Fan edition writes \"*piāo xī sì wú suǒ zhǐ* 飘兮似无所止,\" the Imperial Library edition writes \"*jì wú suǒ yǐ* 寂无所以,\" and the British Library edition matches the *Imperial Commentary*. Sun Kuang’s *Ancient and Modern Textual Collation* states: \"'Drifting like without end' (*liù xī ruò wú zhǐ* 飂兮若无止) appears in one version as '*piāo xī ruò wú zhǐ* 漂兮若无止,' another as '*jiāo xī sì wú zhǐ* 胶兮似无止,' and another as '*jì ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 寂若无所止.'\" The version \"*jiāo xī sì wú zhǐ* 胶兮似无止\" is unattested in any known edition; it is likely a misprint of the character *○*. Takeuchi Yoshio says: The *Tianwen Chao*’s He Shangong edition writes \"*○ xī* ○兮,\" the Guangming stele writes \"*xī* 兮,\" and the Takikawa and Shidetang editions write \"*piāo xī* 漂兮.\" The characters *○* and *○* are variant forms of *piāo* 漂, while *piāo* 漂 and *liù* 飂 are phonetically close. Wu Yun says: Wang Lanquan cites He Shangong’s edition as writing *yuān* 渊, with the note: \"The current He Shangong edition writes *piāo* 漂.\" This stele writes *○*, a character frequently found in Northern steles. Bi Yuan says: The *Zhuangzi*’s line \"deep and boundless like the sea\" (*yuān yuān hū qí ruò hǎi* 渊渊乎其若海) draws from this passage. Qian Zhi notes: \"*Piāo wú suǒ zhǐ* 漂无所止\" is the most comprehensive interpretation. Drifting like the endless wind coursing through the great void, it shares the same meaning as *liù* 飂. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Liù* 飂 means a high wind.\" The character also appears as *○*, as in the *Wu Capital Rhapsody*: \"Riding the soaring winds of *sī fēng* ○○.\" It also appears as *○*, with the *Yupian* defining it as \"the appearance of a high wind.\"\n\nAll people have their purposes; I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nYan Kejun says: \"*Yǒu yǐ* 有以\" appears in all other editions as \"*yǒu yǐ* 有已.\" \"*Wǒ dú wán* 我独顽\" in He Shangong and Wang Bi’s editions includes the character *ér* 而 before *wǒ* 我. Takeuchi Yoshio says: The Dunhuang and Jingfu editions write *yǐ* 以 as *yǐ* 已. Qian Zhi notes: \"*Yǒu yǐ* 有已\" is equivalent to \"*yǒu yǐ* 有以.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Yǐ* 已 means 'to use.'\" In clerical script, it also appears as *○*, written as *yǐ* 以. The *Guangya*’s *Explanation of Words* says: \"*Yǐ* 已 means *yě* 也.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Artificers’ Record* notes: \"*Yǐ* 已 may also be written as *yǐ* 以.\" His commentary on the *Tan Gong* chapter says: \"*Yǐ* 以 and *yǐ* 已 are originally the same character.\" The *Xunzi*’s *Fei Xiang* chapter reads: \"What is the purpose?\" (*hé yǐ yě* 何已也), with the annotation: \"Same as *yǐ* 以.\" Thus, \"*jiē yǒu yǐ* 皆有已\" here means \"*jiē yǒu yǐ* 皆有以,\" as in the *Zhuangzi*’s phrase \"there must be a reason\" (*qí bì yǒu yǐ* 其必有以).\n\nI alone differ from others, and value the nourishment of the Mother.\n\nTao Hongqing states: The Fu Yi edition includes the character *yu* 欲 (\"desire\") after \"*wo du* 我独\" (\"I alone\"). According to Wang Bi’s commentary, \"*Wo du yu yi yu ren* 我独欲异于人\" (\"I alone desire to differ from others\"), the version Wang saw also contained *yu* 欲, which was later omitted in transcription. Laozi describes the essential subtleties of the Dao with fragmented and elusive expressions, often using words like *ruo* 若 (\"as if\"), *ru* 如 (\"like\"), *si* 似 (\"resembling\"), *jiang* 将 (\"about to\"), and *yu* 欲 (\"desiring\")—all conveying this same intent. Thus, the version with *yu* 欲 is superior.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Dunhuang and Suizhou editions write *du* 独 (\"alone\") as *yu* 欲 (\"desire\"). Yan Kejun states: \"*Er gui shi mu* 而贵食母\" (\"and value the nourishment of the Mother\") appears in the imperial commentary as \"*er gui qiu shi yu mu* 而贵求食于母\" (\"and value seeking nourishment from the Mother\"). Li Daochun says: \"*Er gui shi mu* 而贵食母\" is sometimes rendered as \"*er gui qiu shi yu mu* 儿贵求食于母\" (\"the child values seeking nourishment from the Mother\"), which is incorrect. Lao Jian remarks: The two characters \"*shi mu* 食母\" in the Fan edition were mistakenly altered following Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s interpolation, becoming \"*qiu shi yu mu* 求食于母.\" Xuanzong’s own note states, \"The original lacked the characters *qiu* 求 ('seek') and *yu* 于 ('from'); these are my additions,\" making it clear this was not the ancient version, yet Fan failed to correct it.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Most interpretations of this line by various scholars are erroneous; only Su Che grasped its meaning, saying: \"It is like an infant, taking no mixed nourishment, feeding only from the Mother.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Dechongfu* chapter reads, \"*Tunzi shi yu qi si mu* 豚子食于其死母\" (\"the piglet feeds from its dead mother\"), with Guo Xiang’s commentary: \"Feeding on milk.\" Thus, \"*shi mu* 食母\" here means \"feeding on milk from the Mother.\" Additionally, the Wang Xizhi edition includes *qiu* 求 (\"seek\") after *gui* 贵 (\"value\"), confirming this inscription was composed after Emperor Ming’s interpolations.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis reads:\n*E* 阿 and *he* 何 rhyme (歌 *ge* department);\n*wu* 恶 and *ruo* 若 rhyme (鱼 *yu* department; *wu* 恶 is a *wu*-entering tone, *ruo* 若 an entering tone);\n*wei* 畏 and *wei* 畏 rhyme (脂 *zhi* department);\n*zai* 哉, *xi* 熙, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme (之 *zhi* department; *zai* 哉 pronounced *zi*, *tai* 台 as *tuqi* 徒其反, *hai* 孩 as *huqi* 胡其反);\n*gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 rhyme (脂 *zhi* department);\n*hun* 昏 and *men* 闷 rhyme (文 *wen* department; *men* 闷 is level tone);\n*hai* 海, *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 rhyme (之 *zhi* department; *hai* 海 pronounced *xi* 喜).\n\nXi Diao’s analysis:\n*E* 阿, *he* 何, *wu* 恶, and *ruo* 若 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme;\n*gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 rhyme;\n*dun* 沌, *hun* 昏, and *men* 闷 rhyme;\n*hui* 晦, *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 rhyme.\n\nChen Zhu’s analysis:\n*You* 忧, *e* 阿, *he* 何, *wu* 恶, and *ruo* 若 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, *hai* 孩, *gui* 归, *yi* 遗, and *zai* 哉 rhyme.\nThe rest aligns with Xi Diao.\n\nGao Benhan’s analysis:\n*Huang* 荒 (variant *mang* 芒) and *yang* 央 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, *zhao* 兆, *hai* 孩, *gui* 归, *yi* 遗, and *zai* 哉 form one rhyme group, while *gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 also rhyme independently.\nAdditionally, *hun* 昏, *men* 闷 (variant *min* 闵), *hai* 海 (variant *hui* 晦), *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 form another rhyme group.\n\nYang Shuda states: Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis is correct; Xi, Chen, and Gao all err.\n\nDeng Tingzhen notes: *Wu* 恶 and *ruo* 若 rhyme. In ancient pronunciation, both *shanwu* 善恶 (\"good and evil\") and *haowu* 好恶 (\"likes and dislikes\") used the departing tone for *wu* 恶; later generations forcibly distinguished *wu* 恶 in *shanwu* 善恶 as an entering tone. The character *ruo* 若 rhymes with *fu* 赋 in the *Shijing*’s *Zheng Min*, and with *shuo* 硕 in *Da Tian* and *Bi Gong*; *shuo* 硕 in ancient pronunciation rhymed with *zhe* 柘. In *Sheng Min*, *zhe* 柘 rhymes with *lu* 路, while in the *Daxue*, *shuo* 硕 rhymes with *wu* 恶. In *Bi Gong*, *ruo* 若 further rhymes with *zuo* 作, and *zuo* 作 in ancient pronunciation aligned with *zuo* 祚 and *zuo* 胙. Cross-referencing these, *ruo* 若 broadly belongs to the departing tone of the *yu* 鱼 and *yu* 虞 departments, though its modern pronunciation has shifted from the departing tone.\n\nJiang Yougao states: *Men* 闷 is pronounced *mokun* 莫困切. However, in ancient times, it had a level tone and should be grouped with the *hun* 魂 department. In Laozi’s *Yi Su* chapter, \"*Wo du menmen* 我独闷闷\" (\"I alone am content\") rhymes with *hun* 昏. In the *Shun Hua* chapter, \"*Qi zheng menmen* 其政闷闷\" (\"its governance is unadorned\") rhymes with *chun* 醇 (see *Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng*, volume 26, *hun* 慁).\n\nAnother theory from Jiang Yougao holds that *lao* 牢 is not part of the rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi notes: *Lao* 牢 in ancient pronunciation was read as *li* 厘. Jiang Yong’s *Guyun Biaozhun* (Level Tone, Section 11) states: \"*Lao* 牢 is pronounced *langhou* 郎侯切. According to ancient pronunciation, *lao* 牢 was thus, as the *Shiming* explains: '*Liu* 留 means *lao* 牢.' Laozi’s line, '*Zhongren xixi, ru lao tai lao, ru deng chuntai* 众人熙熙，如○太牢，如登春台' ('The multitude are merry, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace'), and Zhuang Xin’s citation of the proverb, '*Wang yang er bu lao, wei wei chi ye* 亡羊而补牢，未为迟也' ('Losing a sheep and mending the pen is not too late'), both read *lao* 牢 as *li* 厘—likely a dialectal variation.\"\n\nAdditionally, *tai* 台 was anciently read as *chi* 持. The *Shiming* states: \"*Tai* 台 means *chi* 持.\" The character *tai* 台 derives from the phonetic *ㄓ*, hence its proximity to *chi* 持. *Hai* 孩 is pronounced *huli* 户黎切, so *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 form a rhyme, as do *lao* 牢 and *zhao* 兆.\n\nMa Xulun states: \"*Xi* 熙, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme at the ends of lines, a point previous scholars have clarified. As for *lao* 牢 and *zhao* 兆, they also harmonize at line ends, constituting an internal rhyme in poetry.\" (*Xiuci Shilun*)\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains 116 characters; the Dunhuang edition, 115; the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions, 132; the Fu Yi edition, 137; and the Fan edition, 141. The Heshang Gong edition titles this chapter \"Yi Su Di Ershi\" 异俗第二十 (\"Different Customs, Twenty\"), the Wang Bi edition \"Ershi Zhang\" 二十章 (\"Chapter Twenty\"), and the Fan edition \"Jue Xue Wu You Zhang Di Ershi\" 绝学无忧章第二十 (\"Cutting Off Learning Brings No Sorrow, Chapter Twenty\").\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nThe demeanor of Kong De follows only the Dao.\nWei Jiasun states: In the imperial commentary, *de* 得 (\"attains\") is written as *de* 德 (\"virtue\").\nYan Kejun notes: \"*Shi cong* 是从\" (\"follows only\") in the *Dayian* edition appears as \"*zhi cong* 之从.\"\n\nQian's note: The character *wei* 唯 appears as *wei* 惟 in various Wang Bi editions, and as *wei* 唯 in the Daozang Wang Bi edition. *Kong* 孔 means \"intense\" or \"great.\" The *Book of Documents* reads *liu fu kong xiu* 六府孔修 (\"the six treasuries are greatly cultivated\"), while the *Records of the Grand Historian* renders it *shen xiu* 甚修 (\"intensely cultivated\"). *Shen* 甚 carries the sense of \"abundant,\" so *kong de* 孔德 may be understood as *sheng de* 盛德 (\"abundant virtue\"). Thus, this line speaks of the demeanor of abundant virtue, which follows only the embodiment of the Dao.\n\nAs a thing, the Dao is only dim and indistinct. Within the dim and indistinct, there are images; within the indistinct and dim, there are things.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The line *hu huang zhong you xiang, huang hu zhong you wu* 忽恍中有象，恍忽中有物 (\"within the indistinct and dim, there are images; within the dim and indistinct, there are things\") is identical in Gu Huan's edition. The imperial commentary reads: *Hu xi huang, qi zhong you ○; huang xi hu, qi zhong you wu* 忽兮恍，其中有○；恍兮忽，其中有物 (\"Dim, ah indistinct—within it, there is ○; indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"). The Heshang Gong edition reads: *Hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang; huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu* 忽兮恍兮，其中有像；怳兮忽兮，其中有物 (\"Dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images; indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"). Some versions invert these two lines. Wang Bi's edition matches the Heshang Gong, with *hu* 忽 written as *hu* 惚. Qian's note: In the Daozang Wang Bi edition, both instances of *hu xi* 惚兮 are written as *hu xi* 忽兮. The *Shiwen* glosses the character *huang* 怳, indicating that the Wang Bi edition originally wrote *huang* 怳. The commentary on the *Toutuo Temple Stele* cites the *Laozi* as writing *huang* 怳, and Wang Bi's commentary also uses *huang* 怳. The *Baopuzi*, in its \"Dizhen\" chapter, quotes the \"Old Master\" in a manner identical to the Heshang Gong edition. The British Library manuscript matches the imperial commentary. Additionally, the Dunhuang edition writes *wei huang* 惟恍 as *wei huang* 惟慌. The *Guangya* (*Shigu* 2) defines ○ as *hu* 忽 (\"sudden\"). The preface to the *Shennü Fu* reads *jingshen huanghu* 精神怳惚 (\"spirit dim and indistinct\"), with the commentary: \"the sense of being unaware of oneself.\" The *Xu Yiqie Jing Yinyi* cites the *Zilin*: *huanghu* 恍惚 means \"the mind is unclear.\" In the Fu Yi and Fan editions, these two characters are written as *mangwu* 芒芴, which were interchangeable in ancient times. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Zhile\") also reads: *Mang hu wu hu, er wu cong chu hu? Wu hu mang hu, er wu you xiang hu?* 芒乎芴乎，而无从出乎？芴乎芒乎，而无有象乎？ (\"Dim, ah indistinct—how can one emerge from it? Indistinct, ah dim—how can there be images within it?\") and *za hu mangwu zhi jian* 杂乎芒芴之间 (\"intermingled within the dim and indistinct\"). These phrases all derive from this passage. Chu Boshi states: *Mangwu* 芒芴 is read identically to *huanghu* 恍惚. The *Guang Hongming Ji* (13), in Shi Falin's *Bianzheng Lun Jiuzhen Pian*, cites *mangwu* 芒芴 as correctly written *huanghu* 恍惚. Yu Yue remarks: The two lines *hu xi huang xi* 惚兮恍兮 and *huang xi hu xi* 恍兮惚兮 should follow the two lines *huang xi hu xi* 恍兮惚兮. This is because they continue the preceding *wei huang wei hu* 惟恍惟惚 (\"only dim and indistinct\"), so one should first say *huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu* 恍兮惚兮，其中有物 (\"indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"), rhyming with the four lines above: *Dao zhi wei wu, wei huang wei hu* 道之为物，惟恍惟惚 (\"As a thing, the Dao is only dim and indistinct\"). The subsequent line, *hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang* 惚兮恍兮，其中有象 (\"dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images\"), then shifts the rhyme. Wang Bi's commentary reads: \"The myriad things begin and are completed, yet one does not know how this occurs. Thus it is said: indistinct, ah dim—dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images.\" The commentary likely quotes the entire passage but omits the four characters *qi zhong you wu* 其中有物 (\"within it, there are things\"). Nevertheless, this demonstrates that the version Wang Bi saw had not yet inverted the lines.\n\nJiang Xichang remarks: According to the *Qiang Ben Cheng Shu*, the quoted passage reads: *Huanghu zhong you xiang, huhuang zhong you wu* 恍惚中有象，惚恍中有物 (\"within the indistinct and dim, there are images; within the dim and indistinct, there are things\"). The Daozang Heshang Gong edition reads: *Huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu; hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang* 怳兮忽兮，其中有物；忽兮怳兮，其中有像 (\"indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things; dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images\"), which aligns with Yu Yue's proposal.\n\nWithin the profound darkness, there is essence; this essence is most true, and within it, there is reliability.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The line *○ ming zhong you jing* ○冥中有精 (\"within the profound darkness, there is essence\") is identical in Gu Huan's edition. The imperial commentary reads *○ xi ming, qi zhong you jing* ○兮冥，其中有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"), while the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions read *○ xi ming xi, qi zhong you jing* ○兮冥兮，其中有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). Luo Zhenyu notes: In the imperial commentary, *zhen* 真 is written as ○, a variant character for *zhen* 真. Qian's note: The *Huainanzi* (\"Daoying Xun\") cites these four lines identically to the Wang Bi edition. The *Wen Xuan* (commentary on Shen Yue's \"Zhongshan Shi\") cites *○ xi ming, zhong qi you jing* ○兮冥，中其有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The Lou Zheng and Panxi editions read *yao xi ming, qi zhong you jing* 杳兮冥，其中有精 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The Guancang edition reads *○ ming zhong you jing* ○冥中有精 (\"within the profound darkness, there is essence\"). The Fu Yi edition reads *you xi ming xi, qi zhong you jing* 幽兮冥兮，其中有精 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"), and the Fan edition reads *you xi ming xi, zhong you jing xi* 幽兮冥兮，中有精兮 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The characters ○, *you* 幽, and *yao* 杳 are phonetically close and interchangeable. Additionally, the line *qi jing shen zhen* 其精甚真 (\"this essence is most true\") appears in Wang Xizhi's edition as *you jing shen zhen* 有精甚真 (\"there is essence, most true\"). This line is absent in the Suizhou edition.\n\nQian's note: The *Guanzi* (\"Neiye\") states: \"Essence is the utmost of *qi*; essence is the purest of *qi*. In all human life, Heaven bestows its essence.\" This aligns with the meaning of *jing* 精 (\"essence\") in this chapter. *Jing* reflects an ancient, naive materialist conception, as discussed in detail in Feng Youlan's essay \"The Material Nature of the Dao in Pre-Qin Daoism.\" The *Zhuangzi* (\"Dechong Fu\") reads *fu Dao you qing you xin, wu wei wu xing, ke zhuan er bu ke shou, ke de er bu ke jian* 夫道有情有信，无为无形，可传而不可受，可得而不可见 (\"The Dao has *qing* and reliability, is without action and formless, can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen\"). Here, *qing* 情 should be *jing* 精 (\"essence\"), so *you qing you xin* 有情有信 (\"has *qing* and reliability\") corresponds to *qi zhong you jing, qi zhong you xin* 其中有精，其中有信 (\"within it, there is essence; within it, there is reliability\").\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.\n\nWu Yun states: The Fu Yi edition reads *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古 (\"from the present to ancient times\"), and the Wang Bi edition matches this stele. Fan Yingyuan remarks: The line *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古 (\"from the present to ancient times\") is identical in the editions of Yan Zun and Wang Bi. Ma Xulun notes: Most editions read *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 (\"from ancient times to the present\"), which is incorrect. *Gu* 古, *qu* 去, and *fu* 甫 rhyme. Fan claims \"Wang Bi matches the ancient edition,\" yet in Wang Bi's commentary, both instances read *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 (\"from ancient times to the present\"). This is likely because later editors altered the text based on other editions, affecting both the base text and Wang Bi's commentary.\n\nJiang Xichang states: According to the *Collected Commentaries on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue* (including annotations by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Wang Pang), Wang Bi’s commentary reads: “Thus it is said, ‘From the present to ancient times, its name does not depart.’” This precisely aligns with Fan Yingyuan’s version of Wang Bi’s text, sufficiently proving that the current edition has been altered by later hands—Ma Xulun’s argument is correct.\n\n\"To encompass the many progenitors.\"\n\"How do I know the nature of the many progenitors? By this.\"\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Dunhuang, Jing, and Sui editions write *zhong* 众 (\"many\") as *zhong* 终 (\"end\"), as *zhong* and *zhong* were homophonous in ancient pronunciation.\nQian Zhi notes: The Jinglong edition writes *zhong* 众 and not *zhong* 终—this is an erroneous collation. The Palace Library edition also writes *zhong* 终. However, *zhong* 终 is incorrect.\n\nThe character *yue* 阅 in ancient texts glosses as \"to gather\" or \"to total.\" Ōta Seiken cites the *Liezi* (\"Zhongni\" chapter): \"He gathered forty disciples to travel together.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Yuandao Xun\") states: \"The totality of the myriad things all passes through one aperture; the roots of the hundred affairs all emerge from one gate.\" The *Chuzhen Xun* reads: \"What heaven covers, what earth bears, what the six directions enclose, what yin and yang exhale, what rain and dew moisten, what the Dao and virtue sustain—all these are born of one father and mother and encompassed in one harmony.\" Gao You’s commentary: \"*Yue* 阅 means ‘to total.’\" Only Ōta argues that *zhongfu* 众甫 refers to \"many fathers,\" citing the *Zhuangzi* (\"Tiandi\" chapter), where Nie Que states: \"There are clans and ancestors; one may be a father to many, but not the father of fathers.\" He claims that in ancient texts, *fu* 甫 and *fu* 父 were interchangeable. Though his view aligns with Yu Yue’s, it is highly forced.\n\nExamining classical texts, *fu* 甫 consistently glosses as \"great.\" Derivative characters from *fu* all carry the meaning of \"great.\" For instance, the *Xunzi* (\"Rongru\" chapter) annotates *bo* 薄 as \"broad and great in appearance\"; the *Han Shi Waizhuan* (\"Changwu\") glosses *fu* 敷 as \"great\"; the *Shuowen* defines *bo* 博 as \"greatly penetrating\"; the *Book of Songs* (\"Beishan\") annotates *pu* 溥 (via Mao’s commentary) as \"great\"; the *Book of Songs* (\"Chegong\") annotates *pu* 圃 (via Mao’s commentary) as \"broad\"; the *Shuowen* defines *pu* 酺 as \"the king’s virtue spreading widely in grand feasting\" and *pu* 誧 as \"grand speech\" (see Dai Zongxiang’s *Shi Fu*). From this, *zhongfu* 众甫 clearly means \"the many great ones.\" Within the realm, there are the Four Greats—\"to encompass the many progenitors\" thus means to total the Four Greats.\n\nYan Kejun states: The phrase *zhi ran* 之然 appears in the imperial commentary and the modern Heshang Gong edition as *zhi ran zai* 之然哉, while Wang Bi’s edition reads *zhi zhuang zai* 之状哉. The *Shiwen* notes: \"One version of Heshang Gong’s text simply reads, ‘How do I know?’\"\nWu Yun states: The phrase *wu he yi zhi* 吾何以知 appears in the Fu Yi edition as *xi yi zhi* 奚以知.\nFan Yingyuan states: The character *xi* 奚 is from the ancient edition.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, per Jiang Yong’s analysis:\n- *Rong* 容 rhymes with *cong* 从 (East Division).\n- *Wu* 物 rhymes with *hu* 惚 (Zhi Division; *hu*, pronounced *hujie*).\n- *Huang* 恍 rhymes with *xiang* 象 (Yang Division).\n- *Hu* 忽 rhymes with *wu* 物 (Zhi Division).\n- *Ming* 冥 rhymes with *jing* 精 (Geng Division).\n- *Zhen* 真 rhymes with *xin* 信 (Zhen Division; *xin*, level tone).\n- *Qu* 去 rhymes with *fu* 甫 (Yu Division).\n\nYao Wentian, Deng Tingzhen, and Xi Tong concur. Bernhard Karlgren reads *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 as *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古, rhyming *gu* 古, *qu* 去, and *fu* 甫. Additionally, *ming* 冥, *jing* 精, *zhen* 真, and *xin* 信 form a paired rhyme. Wei Jiangong notes that these four lines should be examined for their potential rhyme, just as *ming* 名 rhymes with *men* 门 and *ying* 盈 rhymes with *chen* 尘 (see *Studies on Ancient Phonological Systems*).\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains sixty-one characters, matching the Dunhuang edition. The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan editions contain seventy-one characters. Heshang Gong titles this chapter \"Emptying the Heart, Twenty-One,\" Wang Bi titles it \"Chapter Twenty-One,\" and Fan Yingyuan titles it \"The Countenance of the Power of Emptiness, Twenty-One.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n\"Bent, then whole; crooked, then upright.\"\nYan Kejun states: The phrase *wang ze zheng* 枉则正 appears identically in the Fu Yi edition, while other editions read *ze zhi* 则直.\nQian Zhi notes: The Sui Prefecture, Palace Library, and Fan Yingyuan editions all read *zheng* 正. Fan states: \"The character *zheng* 正 aligns with Wang Bi’s ancient edition; one version reads *zhi* 直.\"\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Jing and Sui editions write *zhi* 直 as *zheng* 正, matching the *Huainanzi* (\"Daoying Xun\"). However, the *Daoying Xun* actually cites the two lines as *zhi* 直—Takeuchi’s collation is incorrect.\n\nMoreover, \"bent, then whole\" echoes the *Zhuangzi* (\"Tianxia\" chapter), which describes Lao Dan’s Dao: \"All seek fortune, yet he alone bends to preserve wholeness.\" The *Hongfan* states, \"Wood is said to be bent and straight\"—this also uses wood as a metaphor. \"Bent\" refers to what the *Zhuangzi* (\"Xiaoyaoyou\" chapter) calls \"curled and not fitting the compass or square,\" and what the *Renjianshi* chapter calls \"clenched and unfit for beams or pillars.\" As the saying goes, \"Straight trees are felled first; sweet wells run dry first,\" and \"I walk in curves, sparing my feet\"—this embodies the meaning of \"bent, then whole.\"\n\n\"Crooked, then upright\": *Wang* 枉, per the *Shuowen*, means \"twisted and bent, from *mu* 木 and *qu* ○ phonetic.\" The *Guangya* (\"Shigu\" 1) glosses *qu* ○ as \"bent,\" meaning \"contorted and bowed\"—essentially \"yielding.\" *Zheng* 正 in other editions reads *zhi* 直; *wang* 枉 and *zhi* 直 form a parallel. \"Crooked, then straight\" means \"great straightness appears bent.\" The *Analects* states, \"Elevate the straight and set them above the crooked.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Benjing Xun\") reads, \"Correct the crooked to make it straight.\" The stele text reads *zheng* 正, which also means \"straight.\"\n\nThe *Mo Pian* of the *Guiguzi* states, \"That which is *zheng* 正 is *zhi* 直.\" The *Guangya* (\"Shigu\" 1) reads, \"*Zhi* 直 is *zheng* 正.\" The *Wenyan* commentary to the *Yijing* says, \"*Zhi* 直 is its *zheng* 正.\" *Zhi* 直 and *zheng* 正 may be mutually defined.\n\nThat which is hollow becomes full; that which is worn becomes new. Yan Kejun notes, \"‘Worn, then new’—the *Shiwen* writes it as *bi* 蔽; Fu Yi and the present Wang Bi edition write *bi* 敝.\" Qian’s annotation: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition writes *bi* 弊; the Imperial Commentary edition, the Palace Library edition, the Suizhou edition, the Heshang edition, and all stone inscriptions write *bi* 弊; the *Taiping Yulan* (159) also writes *bi* 弊.\n\nAs for the character *wa* 洼, the Daoist Canon’s Heshang edition writes *wa* 窊. *Wa* 洼 and *wa* 窊 are the same character, both meaning \"sunken and low-lying.\" *Wa* 窊 is the ancient form of *wa* 洼. The *Shuowen* states, \"*Wa* 窊 means ‘filthy and slanted downward.’\" The *Guangya* (\"Shigu\") reads, \"*Wa* 窊 means ‘low.’\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* (2) cites the *Ancient Laozi* as writing *wa* 窊○. Peng Qi’s *Shiwen* notes, \"*Wa* 洼 is pronounced *li wu gua*; it means ‘hollow.’ Where the earth is hollow, water fills it—this illustrates how the virtue of humility is ever full.\"\n\nThat which is little is gained; that which is much may be lost.\n\nThus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"Some editions write *huo* 惑 instead of *huo* 或.\"\nQian’s commentary: The Suizhou edition and the Palace Library edition agree with this stone inscription. Moreover, the *Outer Chapters of the Shenzi* cites seven sentences from \"Laozi says,\" omitting only the two characters *shi yi* 是以, matching Fu Yi’s version. Here, *de* 得 refers to the \"attainment of the One\" as spoken of in Chapter 39. *Huo* 或 should be read as *huo* 惑, meaning \"sometimes this, sometimes that,\" contrasting with the meaning of \"attaining the One.\"\n\nNot displaying oneself, thus one is illuminated;\nNot asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished;\nNot boasting, thus one achieves merit;\nNot priding oneself, thus one endures.\n\nQian’s commentary: In the stele edition, the character *zhang* 彰 is damaged and unclear, and the following *bu* 不 is effaced; these should be supplemented according to other editions. Furthermore, in the Suizhou and Palace Library editions, the phrase \"Not displaying oneself, thus one is illuminated\" appears after \"Not asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished\"; in Tang Li Yue’s edition, \"Not boasting, thus one achieves merit\" appears after \"Not priding oneself, thus one endures.\" Additionally, the *Zhuangzi* (\"Shanmu\") states: \"I have heard the Perfect Person say, 'Those who boast achieve no merit; those who complete merit fall; those who complete fame are diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the multitude?'\" This echoes Chapter 9 of the *Laozi*—\"Having achieved merit, withdraw the self; this is the Dao of heaven\"—and the present chapter’s teaching, \"Not boasting, thus one achieves merit.\"\n\nOnly by not contending does nothing under heaven contend with him.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang edition omits the character *neng* 能.\nQian’s commentary: The *Huainanzi* (\"Yuandao\") states, \"Because he does not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with him,\" which is drawn from this chapter. Wang Niansun says: \"'None dare' originally read 'none can'; later scholars altered it following the *Wenzi* (\"Daoyuan\"). Only by not contending with the myriad things can none contend with him—this is what is meant by 'the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.' If it read 'none dare,' it would miss the point. Below, it says, 'Great merit, firm and unyielding, none can contend with it.' The *Laozi* states, 'Only by not contending does nothing under heaven contend with him,' and again, 'Because he does not contend, nothing under heaven can contend with him.' All these serve as evidence.\" Wei Zheng’s *Qunshu Zhiyao* cites this sentence as \"none can contend with him.\"\n\nWhat the ancients called \"the crooked is preserved whole\"—was this an empty saying?\nThus it is preserved whole and returned.\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"Was this an empty saying\" in other editions reads \"Was this an empty saying indeed?\" \"Thus preserved whole\" in other editions reads \"truly preserved whole,\" without the character *gu* 故.\nWei Jiasun notes: The Imperial Commentary includes a *zhe* 者 after *quan* 全, and the following sentence reads \"Was this empty speech indeed?\" Yan cites the *zai* 哉 but overlooks the *zhe* 者 and *yan* 言.\nQian’s commentary: The Suizhou edition matches this stone inscription. *Cheng* 成 should be *cheng* 誠. Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* (2) cites the *Ancient Laozi*, where *cheng* 成 appears as ○, and *cheng* 誠 appears as ○. In the received text, *cheng* 成 appears seventeen times, while *cheng* 誠 appears only here. Moreover, \"the crooked is preserved whole\" is an ancient saying; the *Sunzi* (\"Jiudi\") states, \"Those skilled in the Dao preserve themselves through crookedness,\" which clearly attests to this. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Tianxia\") discusses the *Laozi*, saying, \"While others seek fortune, he alone preserves himself through crookedness, saying, 'May I merely avoid blame?'\" This is drawn from the present chapter.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang’s reading:\n*Ying* 盈 and *xin* 新 rhyme (Zhen and Geng in harmonious rhyme; these two lines originally appeared below \"the crooked becomes straight,\" but have been moved here according to rhyme).\n*Zhi* 直, *de* 得, *huo* 惑, and *shi* 式 rhyme (Zhi group; *huo* 惑 read as *hu bi*).\n*Ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, *gong* 功, and *zhang* 长 rhyme (Yang and Dong in harmonious rhyme; *gong* 功 rhymes as *guang*).\n*Zheng* 争 and *zheng* 争 rhyme (Geng group).\n\nQian’s commentary: *Ying* 盈 belongs to the Geng group, *xin* 新 to the Zhen group—these are Zhen and Geng in harmonious rhyme. *Ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, and *zhang* 长 belong to the Yang group; *gong* 功 to the Dong group—these are Yang and Dong in harmonious rhyme. The character *zhi* 直 in the Jing, Suizhou, and Palace Library editions is written as *zheng* 正, which belongs to the Geng group. Xi Diao takes *quan* 全, *zheng* 正, *ying* 盈, and *xin* 新 as rhyming, saying: \"Rhyme *quan* 全 and *xin* 新 with *zheng* 正 and *ying* 盈—this is a case of sound variation, like the rhyming of *qing* 清, *ren* 人, *xin* 新, *nian* 年, *sheng* 生, *lian* 怜, *sheng* 声, *ming* 鸣, *zheng* 征, and *cheng* 成 in the *Jiu Bian*.\" Gao Benhan agrees with Xi, though he treats *zheng* 正 and *ying* 盈 as internal rhyme. He also takes *de* 得 and *huo* 惑 as rhyming, *yi* 一 and *shi* 式 as rhyming, and *ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, *gong* 功, *zhang* 长, *zheng* 争, and *zheng* 争 as a single rhyme. The various theories are divergent; only Jiang’s rearrangement of the text to fit the rhyme seems unsatisfactory. This chapter actually employs two alternating rhymes: *quan* 全, *ying* 盈, and *xin* 新 form one rhyme; *zhi* 直, *de* 得, *huo* 惑, and *shi* 式 form another. Chen Zhu takes *zai* 哉 and *zhi* 之 as rhyming. *Zai* 哉 and *zhi* 之 both belong to the Zhi group. Yao Nai treats \"What the ancients called 'the crooked is preserved whole'—was this an empty saying? Truly preserved whole and returned\" as a single section with the following chapter, \"Sparse speech is natural,\" arguing: \"*Yan* 言, *quan* 全, and *ran* 然 rhyme. 'Still as if valuing speech, merit achieved and affairs completed, the hundred clans all say, \"We are naturally thus\"—this explains the present passage.'\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains seventy-seven characters; the Palace Library edition, seventy-four; the Heshang, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions, seventy-eight.\n\nThe Heshang Gong edition titles this \"Benefiting Through Humility, Twenty-Second,\" the Wang Bi edition titles it \"Chapter Twenty-Two,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Crooked Is Preserved Whole, Chapter Twenty-Two.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nSparse speech is natural.\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning,\nFierce rains do not last the day.\nWho brings these about?\nHeaven and Earth.\n\nYan Zun notes: \"Below 雨, the character 不 is effaced; it should be restored according to other editions.\"\n\"希\" is consistent across all editions; the Fu edition writes it as \"稀.\"\n\"终\" is written as \"崇\" in both the Fu and Fan editions.\nAbove \"飘风,\" the Wang, Fu, and Fan editions include the character \"故.\"\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong, Guangming, Jingfu, and British Library editions all omit \"故.\"\nAdditionally, the Palace Library edition writes \"骤\" as \"○,\" while the Fan edition writes it as \"暴.\"\nMa Xulun states: \"崇\" and \"终\" are ancient loan characters. In the *Book of Documents*, \"其終出于不祥,\" the Ma edition writes \"終\" as \"崇,\" serving as evidence.\nHe further states: In the Palace Library edition, \"骤\" is written as \"趨,\" as \"趨\" and \"骤\" were also ancient loan characters.\nWho is responsible for these?\nHeaven and Earth.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth above cannot endure long—how much less can man?\n\nYan Kejun states: The Heshang and Wang Bi editions include the character *zhe* 者 after *ci* 此. *Shang bu* 尚不 in all other editions appears as *shang bu* 上不, and *yu ren* 于人 at the end of the sentence in all other editions includes the particle *hu* 乎.\nQian Zhi notes: The Palace Library and Suizhou editions omit *hu* 乎. The *Zuozhuan* *Zhaogong* 28th year *Zhengyi* commentary cites: 'Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure forever—how much less man *hu* 乎,' and the *Mouzi Lihuo Lun* also cites: 'Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long—how much less man *hu* 乎,' both including *hu* 乎.\n\nThus, those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way;\nthose who align with virtue/power are embraced by virtue/power;\nthose who align with loss are met with loss.\n\nYan Kejun states: The ancient characters *de* 得 and *de* 德 were interchangeable; *dezhi* 德之 thus means *dezhi* 得之.\nThe Heshang edition reads: 'Thus, those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way; those devoted to virtue/power align with virtue/power; those devoted to loss align with loss. Those who align with the Way, the Way delights in attaining them; those who align with virtue/power, virtue/power delights in attaining them; those who align with loss, loss delights in attaining them.'\nThe Imperial Commentary and Wang Bi editions omit the three *le* 乐 characters; the rest follows the Heshang edition.\nYu Yue states: The two characters *dao zhe* 道者 in the Wang edition are superfluous. The original text reads: 'Those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way,' and the following *dezhe* 德者 and *shizhe* 失者 elliptically follow the preceding *congshi* 从事, as if to say: 'Those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way; those who devote themselves to virtue/power align with virtue/power; those who devote themselves to loss align with loss.' The *Huainanzi Dao Ying* chapter cites Laozi: 'Those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way,' proving that the ancient edition did not repeat *dao zhe* 道者.\nWang Bi’s commentary states: 'Thus, those who devote themselves to the Way... therefore it is said they align with the Way,' showing that the edition Wang relied on indeed read: 'Thus, those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way.'\nJi Yun states: The *Yongle Dadian* omits *le* 乐, and the following two sentences are the same.\nYi Shunding states: Wang Bing’s commentary on the *Suwen Si Qi Tiao Shen Da Lun* chapter cites this passage, also omitting *le* 乐.\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Imperial Commentary and British Library editions omit *le* 乐.\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan editions also omit *le* 乐. The two *dezhi* 德之 should read *dezhi* 得之. Though *de* 德 and *de* 得 were anciently interchangeable, here it should be *de* 得. The Suizhou and Palace Library editions both read *dao dezhi* 道得之 and *de dezhi* 德得之; the Fu and Fan editions also read *de* 得, as this *de* 得 pairs with the following *shi* 失 to form parallel structure.\n\nThe trust that is insufficient gives rise to distrust.\n\nYan Kejun states: The Heshang and Wang Bi editions read: 'Trust is insufficient *yan* 焉, and so there is distrust *yan* 焉.'\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong and British Library editions omit both *yan* 焉; the Jingfu edition omits the second *yan* 焉.\nQian Zhi notes: The Suizhou, Palace Library, and Wang Xizhi editions also omit both *yan* 焉; the Fu and Muromachi editions omit the second *yan* 焉. Omitting the second *yan* 焉 is correct, as explained in Wang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi Yubian* (Part 1).\nThese two sentences also appear in Chapter Seventeen and may be a misplaced repetition.\n\n[Phonology]\nThis chapter, according to Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du*, has no rhyme.\nChen Zhu: The three *de* 德 and *zhi* 之 characters rhyme.\nGao Benhan: *Yan* 言 and *ran* 然 rhyme.\nQian Zhi notes: *Yan* 言 and *ran* 然 both belong to the *yuan* 元 rhyme group. Moreover, *tian* 天 and *di* 地 form a rhyming couplet; the six *tong* 同 characters rhyme across alternating lines; the two *xin* 信 characters rhyme at the beginning and end. This exemplifies the free-rhyming style used in the *Laozi*.\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains fifty-eight characters; the Palace Library edition is the same. The Heshang edition has eighty-seven characters; the Wang edition, eighty-eight; the Fu edition, ninety-two; and the Fan edition, eighty-three. The Heshang edition titles this chapter 'Emptiness and Nothingness Twenty-Third'; the Wang edition, 'Chapter Twenty-Three'; and the Fan edition, 'Sparse Speech and Naturalness Chapter Twenty-Third.'\n\nChapter Twenty-Four\nThose who stand on tiptoe do not endure...\"\n\nYan Kejun states: The *Yuzhu* and Heshang editions read \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not endure,\" while Wang Bi’s edition has \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 企) do not endure.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Shiwen* glosses, \"The Heshang edition has *chi* 豉.\" It appears that *chi* is likely a corruption of *qi* 跂. The *Yuzhu* and *Guangming* editions also read *qi* 跂. The *Guangming* edition includes the line \"Those who pant do not endure\" above this. Wu Yun, in *Erbai Lantingzhai Jinshi Ji*, collating the *Guangming* edition, states: \"All other editions lack the four characters 'Those who pant do not endure.'\" Wei Jiasun remarks: Few characters remain on this stele, but among them, the line \"Those who pant do not endure\" (Yan Qian’s note: \"文\" is a misprint for \"久\") is absent from all transmitted block-printed editions and other stone inscriptions. Yan Qian notes: The Palace Library and Suizhou editions both correctly read \"Those who pant do not endure.\" The *Shuowen* defines *chuan* 喘 as \"rapid breathing.\" Moreover, *qi* 企 and *qi* 跂 were used interchangeably in antiquity. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Autumn Floods\" chapter reads, \"to pick up without standing on tiptoe (*qi* 跂),\" and the *Shiwen* notes, \"*Qi* 跂 is written as *qi* 企 in one version.\" In the \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, \"men see him standing on tiptoe (*qi* 跂),\" the ancient manuscript scroll reads *qi* 企. The *Wen Xuan*’s *Jiang Fu* commentary by Li Shan also states, \"企 and 跂 are the same.\" Thus, the Heshang edition’s *qi* 跂 is equivalent to *qi* 企. The *Hanshu*’s \"Annals of Emperor Gaozu,\" in Yan Shigu’s commentary, defines *qi* 企 as \"to lift the heels and stretch the body.\" The *Yupian* states: \"*Qi* 跂, pronounced *chi* 豉. There is a country of those who walk on tiptoes, whose people walk without their heels touching the ground.\" The *Zilin* defines *qi* 企 as \"to lift the heels.\" The meanings of the two characters are also identical.\n\n○者不行.\nYan Kejun states: \"○者\" appears as \"○者\" in all editions. I believe it should be \"○者.\" Wei Jiasun remarks: In the original engraving, \"○\" is offset to the right, suggesting the left half of \"○\" was omitted. Yan’s emendation to \"○\" as \"○\" is incorrect. Yan Qian notes: \"○\" is equivalent to *kua* 跨. The *Yupian*’s section on \"○\" provides two pronunciations: *kou hua* and *kou wa*, both meaning \"to take a stride,\" identical to *kua* 跨. The *Shuowen* defines *kua* 跨 as \"to step over,\" and Duan Yucai comments: \"To widen the space between the legs in order to cross something.\" The Muromachi edition reads the first two lines as \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not endure; those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not walk,\" but the repetition of *qi* 跂 is erroneous.\n\nThose who rely on their own vision are not enlightened; those who assert their own correctness are not illustrious; those who boast achieve no merit; those who are self-conceited do not endure. Yan Kejun states: The Heshang and Wang Bi editions include the particle *zhe* 者 after \"rely on their own vision,\" and the same applies to the following four lines. Wei Jiasun remarks: The *Yuzhu* edition includes *zhe* 者 after \"vision,\" but omits it in the next three lines. Yan Qian notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the \"Indictment of Wang Yuan\" omits both instances of *zhe* 者. Additionally, the Palace Library and Suizhou editions read \"boast\" (*zi rao* 自饶) instead of \"self-assertion\" (*zi fa* 自伐).\n\nIn the Way, these are called surplus food and superfluous conduct. Yan Kejun states: \"In the Way\" (*qi zai Dao* 其在道) appears as \"in the Way, too\" (*qi zai Dao ye* 其在道也) in Wang Bi’s edition, and as \"in relation to the Way\" (*qi yu Dao* 其于道也) in the *Yuzhu* and Heshang editions. Yan Qian notes: The character *zhui* 赘 in the Palace Library and Suizhou editions appears as *chuo* 啜, which is incorrect. The *Fangyan* defines *chuo* 啜 as \"to offer food,\" and the *Zilin* defines it as \"to pour wine as an offering, to sacrifice.\" The phrase *chuo xing* 啜行 is meaningless, likely a phonetic corruption. Wang Dao states: \"Conduct\" (*xing* 行) should be \"form\" (*xing* 形). \"Superfluous form\" refers to forms that are appendages, such as webbed toes. Yi Shunding remarks: \"Conduct\" (*xing* 行) may be interchangeable with \"form\" (*xing* 形). \"Superfluous form\" aligns with Wang Bi’s commentary on \"superfluity.\" Superfluity can refer to form but not to conduct. The *Liezi*’s \"Tang’s Questions\" chapter reads, \"Taihang and Wangwu, the two mountains,\" and Zhang Zhan’s commentary notes, \"行 should be 形.\" This confirms that *xing* 行 and *xing* 形 were used interchangeably in ancient texts. Zhuang Xichang states: According to Li Yue’s *Daode Zhenjing Xinzhu* from the Tang dynasty: \"Like leftover food, like excess flesh on the body.\" Lin Xi’s *Daode Zhenjing Kouyi* from the Song dynasty states: \"Leftover food is discarded; superfluous growths on the body are detested.\" Chen Jingyuan’s *Daode Zhenjing Cangshi Zuanwei* from the Song dynasty states: \"Like discarded leftovers, which people detest; like attached growths, which people find ugly.\" All three texts interpret *xing* 行 as *xing* 形. Yan Qian notes: Reading *xing* 行 as *xing* 形 is correct. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Webbed Toes\" chapter states: \"Attached growths and hanging wens emerge from the body and exceed one’s nature.\" The *Guangya* defines *zhui* 赘 as \"a wen.\" The *Shiming* explains it as \"a piece of flesh growing horizontally, attached to the body,\" or \"a tumor.\" The character *xuan* 县 in \"attached growths and hanging wens\" is written as *xuan* 悬 in the *Yiqiejing Yinyi* and the *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Chen Kongzhang’s \"Proclamation to Yuzhou on Behalf of Yuan Shao.\" Since attached growths and hanging wens emerge from the body, they are called \"superfluous forms.\" *Zhui xing* 赘行 should be read as *zhui xing* 赘形, as the characters were interchangeable in ancient texts. Gao Heng states: I suspect \"conduct\" (*xing* 行) should be \"clothing\" (*yi* 衣). In ancient script, *yi* 衣 was written as ○, and *xing* 行 as ○, leading to confusion due to their similarity. The *Fayan*’s \"Inquiring into the Way\" chapter states, \"Whether using or not using intelligence, whether benefiting or not benefiting, there is no superfluity or deficiency,\" and Sima Guang’s commentary notes: \"Excess is called superfluity; insufficiency is called deficiency.\" Thus, superfluity is also surplus. \"Surplus food and superfluous clothing\" is akin to \"surplus food and surplus clothing.\" When food is in surplus, the hungry detest it; when clothing is in surplus, the cold detest it. Hence, it is said, \"Some beings may detest them,\" which aligns with the modern proverb, \"One family’s warmth and fullness invite a thousand families’ resentment.\"\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nZhu Qian’s note: Gao’s argument is highly discerning, yet emending the text to explain the *Classic* makes it difficult to inspire confidence. Moreover, the phrase \"superfluous clothing\" (*zhuì yī* 赘衣) does not simply mean \"surplus clothing\" (*yú yī* 余衣). The *Guangyun*, under the *ji* 霁 rhyme for *zhuì* 赘, states: \"*Zhuì yī* is an official title.\" It is thus abundantly clear that it cannot form a parallel with \"surplus food\" (*yú shí* 余食). \"Some beings may detest them,\" and therefore the man of the Way does not dwell in such a state.\n\nYan Kejun says: In the phrase \"some beings may detest them\" (*wù huò è zhī* 物或恶之), all versions lack the character *you* 有 (\"may\"). In the phrase \"therefore the man of the Way does not dwell\" (*gù yǒu dào bù chǔ* 故有道不处), the *Yu zhu* 御注 and Wang Bi’s editions include the particle *zhe* 者 after *Dao* 道, while the *Heshang Gong* 河上公 edition includes *zhe* 者 and ends the sentence with *ye* 也. Zhu Qian’s note: In the phrase \"some (*huò* 或) may detest them,\" all versions lack the character *you* 有. The *Guan* 馆 edition and *Suizhou* 遂州 edition omit the character *huò* 或 after *you* 有. The *Guangya*, in its first chapter on glosses, states: \"*Huò* 或 means *you* 有.\" This shows that *huò* 或 and *you* 有 were interchangeable in antiquity, and one of them must be superfluous. I suspect that this *you* 有 is a phonetic shift from *chǒu* 丑 (\"repulsive\"). Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun*, in its fifth fascicle, cites an ancient *Laozi* that includes the character *chǒu* 丑, written as ○. Further note: Sima Guang’s commentary states: \"These are all cases of external striving and internal depletion. Just as discarded surplus food provokes disgust, so an attached superfluous form provokes revulsion.\" Here, *chǒu* 丑 (\"repulsive\") and *è* 恶 (\"detest\") form a parallel. I suspect that the version Sima Guang saw originally read: \"some beings find them repulsive and detest them\" (*wù huò chǒu è zhī* 物或丑恶之).\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Sheng’s *Yun Du* 韵读 groups the rhymes as follows: *xíng* 行, *míng* 明, *zhāng* 彰, *gōng* 功, *cháng* 长, and *xíng* 行 (the *yang* 阳 and *dong* 东 rhymes intermingle, with *gōng* 功 rhyming as *guāng* 光); *è* 恶 and *chǔ* 处 rhyme (both in the *yu* 鱼 rhyme group, with *chǔ* 处 in the departing tone). Yao Wentian agrees, though Deng Tingzhen does not include *gōng* 功. Note: *xíng* 行, *míng* 明, *zhāng* 彰, and *cháng* 长 belong to the *yang* 阳 rhyme group, while *gōng* 功 belongs to the *dong* 东 group—this is an instance of *yang* and *dong* rhymes intermingling.\n\nThe *Jinglong* 景龙 stele edition contains forty-two characters. The *Guan* 馆 edition’s note mistakenly records \"thirty-one characters\" (卅 is an error for ○). The *Heshang Gong* 河上公, *Fu* 傅, and Wang [Bi] editions contain forty-eight characters; the Wang [Bi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions contain forty-seven. The *Heshang Gong* edition titles this chapter \"Bitter Kindness\" (*Kǔ ēn* 苦恩, twenty-fourth), while the Wang edition titles it \"Chapter Twenty-Four\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Chapter on One Who Stands on Tiptoe Does Not Endure\" (*Qǐ zhě bù lì zhāng dì èrshísì* 跂者不立章第二十四).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and void!\nIt stands alone and does not change,\ncircling everywhere without peril,\nand may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it the *Dao*.\nForced to name it, I call it *great*.\n\n---\n\nZhu Qian’s note: In the stele edition, the phrase \"I force a name upon it, calling it\" (*wú qiǎng wéi zhī míng yuē* 吾强为之名曰) is followed by a character that is indistinct due to erosion; it should be supplemented as *dà* 大 (\"great\") based on other editions. Furthermore, all editions lack the second *wú* 吾 (\"I\") in this sentence, which is likely superfluous. The Fan edition includes the characters *gù qiǎng* 故强 (\"therefore forced\") before *zì* 字 (\"style\"), while the Fu edition writes *qiǎng* 强 as *qiáng* 強. Fan Yingyuan says: \"Wang Bi’s edition matches the ancient version. The *Heshang Gong* edition lacks the character ○, and I follow the ancient version.\" Liu Shipei says: According to the *Han Feizi*’s *Jie Lao* 解老 chapter, \"The sage observes its profound emptiness, employs its all-pervading circulation, and forcibly styles it the *Dao*,\" the character *qiǎng* 强 (\"forced\") should precede *zì* 字 (\"style\"), aligning with the phrase below, \"forced to name it, I call it *great*\" (*qiǎng wéi zhī míng yuē dà* 强为之名曰大). The present text is missing this character.\n\nYu Shunding says: According to the *Zhouyi Jijie* (Collected Explications of the *Book of Changes*), volume seventeen, Gan Bao quotes: \"Laozi says, *'I do not know its name; forcibly styling it, I call it the Dao.'*\" The character *qiǎng* 强 (\"forced\") precedes *zì* 字 (\"style\"), matching the version cited in the *Mouzi*. Zhuang Xichang says: Fan [Yingyuan] states that \"Wang Bi’s edition matches the ancient version,\" which implies that Wang’s text also includes *qiǎng* 强 before *zì* 字. In the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Zeyang\" chapter, Guo Xiang’s commentary reads, \"and forcibly styles it the Dao,\" indicating that Guo’s edition likewise includes *qiǎng* 强. Reasoning from principle, if *great* is a forced name, then *Dao* must also be a forced style—thus, the version with *qiǎng* 强 before *zì* 字 is correct.\n\n□□ passes away; passing away is called *far*; far is called *return*.\nQian Zhi notes: The stele edition includes the characters *dà yuē* 大曰 (\"great is called\") before *shì* 逝 (\"passes away\"), though the inscription is blurred and unclear; these should be restored according to other editions. Yan Kejun says: For *\"far is called return,\"* the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions write *fǎn* 反 (\"return\"). Wu Yun says: The Fu and Yizhou editions both write *fǎn* 返 (\"return\") instead of *fǎn* 反. Qian Zhi notes: The Panxi, Louzheng, Gu Huan, and Zhao Mengfu editions also write *fǎn* 返, matching this stele. *Return* means that all things, in their multiplicity, each revert to their root. To describe the body of the Dao: *great* does not suffice to encompass it, so it is named *passing away*. The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* section states: *\"Passing away* 逝 means *to proceed* 行.\" The *Analects* says, *\"The passing away is like this!\"* and Huang Kan’s commentary explains: \"An expression of departure.\" Yet *passing away* still does not suffice, so it is further named *far*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Far* 远 means *distant* 辽.\" The *Erya*’s *Shigu* section says: *\"Far* 远 means *remote* 遐.\" The *Guoyu* commentary explains: \"Referring to what lies beyond the reach of ear and eye.\" However, where there is departure, there must be return, so it is also called *return*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Return* 返 means *to come back* 还.\" The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* section says: *\"Return* 返 means *to revert* 归.\" In returning, the Dao circulates without cease.\n\nThe Dao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; the king is great.\nYan Kejun says: In all editions, the character *gù* 故 (\"thus\") precedes *\"the Dao is great.\"* For *\"the king is great,\"* all editions include *yì* 亦 (\"also\") after *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). Qian Zhi notes: The Fu edition omits *gù* 故, the Suzhou edition omits *yì* 亦, and the Palace Library edition omits both *gù* 故 and *yì* 亦. Additionally, the Fu and Fan editions write *rén* 人 (\"human\") instead of *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). Fan Yingyuan says: The character *rén* 人 (\"human\") in Fu Yi’s edition matches the ancient version, while the *Heshang Gong* edition writes *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). From the perspective of *Heshang Gong*, the king is the most exalted among humans, reflecting a reverence for the sovereign. However, considering the later phrase *\"humans emulate Earth,\"* the ancient version’s meaning is coherent. Moreover, humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, standing alongside Heaven and Earth as one of the Three Powers. When entrusted with this Dao, humans are indeed also great. Chen Zhu says: The *Shuowen*’s *Da* 大 section states: *\"Heaven is great, Earth is great, humans are also great\"*—depicting the human form. This is the version Xu Shen encountered. Duan Yucai’s commentary notes: *\"The Laozi says, 'The Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, humans are also great.' ... 'Humans emulate Earth, Earth emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao.'\" Thus, Duan’s edition likely also read *\"humans are also great.\"* Otherwise, he would have specified that modern editions read *\"the king is also great.\"* The correction is now established. Humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, the most evolved product of Heaven’s process—hence, *\"humans are also great.\"*\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them.\nYan Kejun says: For *\"and the king occupies one,\"* the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions write *\"and the king resides among them.\"* Qian Zhi notes: The Fan edition writes *rén* 人 (\"human\") instead of *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). The Fu edition reads *\"and the king occupies one of them in honor,\"* where *zūn* 尊 (\"honor\") is likely a miswriting of *yān* 焉 (\"among\") due to graphical similarity. The *Guang Hongming Ji*, in Falin’s response to Fu Yi’s critique of Buddhism, quotes the following line as *\"and the Dao occupies one of them.\"* Additionally, the character *chǔ* 处 (\"occupies\") in the Palace Library and Fu editions is written as *chǔ* 处, while the Fan edition writes *jū* 居 (\"resides\"); *chǔ* 处 is correct. Jiang Xichang says: \"According to Wang Bi’s commentary, *'occupying the greatness of the ruler,'* Wang’s edition writes *jū* 居 as *chǔ* 处. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* also quotes it as *chǔ* 处.\"\n\nHumans emulate Earth; Earth emulates Heaven; Heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity.\nQian Zhi notes: For *\"humans emulate Earth,\"* the Fu edition retains *rén* 人 (\"humans\"), while Kou Caizhi’s edition writes *wáng* 王 (\"king\")—a later interpolation by those who revered the sovereign, altering the original text. This practice has a long history. However, Gu Huan’s *Chengshu* commentary states, *\"Humans* 人 refers to the king,\" which, though convoluted, still serves as evidence that the *Laozi* originally read *rén* 人, not *wáng* 王.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads rhymes as follows: *chéng* 成 and *shēng* 生 rhyme (Geng 耕 department); *gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, *mǔ* 母, and *dào* 道 rhyme (Zhi 之 and You 幽 interdepartmental rhyme, with *gǎi* 改 read as *yǐ* 已 and *dào* 道 rhyming as *tú yǐ fǎn* 徒以反). *Dà* 大 and *shì* 逝 rhyme (Zhi 祭 department, with *dà* 大 read as *tú liè fǎn* 徒列反 and *shì* 逝 as *shí liè fǎn* 时列反). *Yuǎn* 远 and *fǎn* 反 rhyme (Yuan 元 department). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen did not address the character *dào* 道. Qian Zhi notes: *Gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, and *mǔ* 母 belong to the Zhi 之 department; *dào* 道 belongs to the You 幽 department—these form an interdepartmental rhyme. Xi Di: *Gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, and *mǔ* 母 rhyme; *shì* 逝, *yuǎn* 远, and *fǎn* 反 rhyme. He adds: *\"Shì* 逝 is read as *xiān* 鲜. For example, in the *Book of Songs*’ *Sang Rou*, *'shì bù yǐ zhuó'* 逝不以濯 is cited in the *Mozi*’s *Shang Xian* as *'xiān bù yǐ zhuó'* 鲜不以濯. In the *Book of Songs*’ *Xin Tai*, *xiān* 鲜 rhymes with *cǐ* 泚 and *mí* 弥; in *Gu Feng*, *sōu* 搜 and *wēi* 萎 rhyme with *yuàn* 怨—all serving as examples.\"*\n\nChen Zhu: The five instances of *dà* 大 rhyme with *yān* 焉, *tiān* 天, and *rán* 然.\nKarlgren: *Dà* 大, *shì* 逝, *yuǎn* 远, and *fǎn* 返 form one rhyme, while *yuǎn* 远 and *fǎn* 返 also rhyme independently. Additionally, *tiān* 天 and *rán* 然 rhyme.\nQian Zhi notes: *Yuǎn* 远 and *fǎn* 反 rhyme. The *Analects*’ *Zi Han* chapter cites lost *Shi* 诗 verses; the *Chu Ci*’s *Li Sao*, *Guo Shang*, and *Ai Ying* all provide collateral evidence. Furthermore, the *dà* 大 in *\"qiǎng míng zhī yuē dà\"* 强名之曰大 rhymes distantly with the five *dà* 大 below.\nChen Di states: *\"Gǎi\"* 改 is pronounced *jǐ* 己, as *Shuowen* lists *jǐ* 己 as its phonetic. In the *Laozi*: *\"Dúlì ér bù gǎi, zhōu xíng ér bù dài\"* 独立而不改，周行而不殆; the *Zhuangzi* cites an ancient poem: *\"Měi chéng zài jiǔ, è chéng bù jí gǎi\"* 美成在久，恶成不及改.\nThe *Jinglong* stele version contains seventy-nine characters; the *Guan* edition’s chapter-end note matches this count. The *Heshang Gong* version has eighty-six characters, Wang Bi’s eighty-five, Fu Yi’s eighty-seven, and Fan Yingyuan’s eighty-eight. The *Heshang Gong* titles it *\"Xiàng Xuán Zhāng Dì Èrshíwǔ\"* 象玄章第二十五, Wang Bi’s *\"Èrshíwǔ Zhāng\"* 二十五章, and Fan Yingyuan’s *\"Yǒu Wù Hùn Chéng Zhāng Dì Èrshíwǔ\"* 有物混成章第二十五. The *Jinglong* stele mistakenly merges the following chapter’s *\"Jìng wèi zào jūn\"* 静为躁君 into this one.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n*Virtue is the root of the light; stillness is the lord of the restless.*\nQian Zhi notes: Huang Kan’s *Lunyu Xue’er Yishu* cites it as *\"Zhòng wèi qīng gēn, jìng wèi zào běn\"* 重为轻根，静为躁本—*\"gēn\"* 根 and *\"běn\"* 本 form a parallel, and the meaning is superior.\n*Thus the noble person travels all day without leaving the baggage train.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Shì yǐ jūnzǐ\"* 是以君子 appears as *\"shì yǐ shèngrén\"* 是以圣人 in the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions.\nQian Zhi notes: Han Fei’s *Jie Lao* uses *\"jūnzǐ\"* 君子; the *Panxi*, *Lou Zheng*, *Gao Diao*, Fu, Fan, and Wang Xizhi editions all concur. Karlgren’s edition omits the four characters *\"shì yǐ jūnzǐ\"* 是以君子. The *Suizhou* edition reads *\"xíng zhōng rì\"* 行终日 instead of *\"zhōng rì xíng\"* 终日行. The *Yuzhu* and *Jingfu* editions write *\"zī\"* 辎 as ○, with Luo Yun noting: \"This is an alternate form of *zī* 辎.\" Hong Yixuan states: The *Heshang Gong* commentary reads: *\"Zī, jìng yě. Shèngrén zhōng rì xíng Dào, bù lí qí jìng yǔ zhòng yě.\"* 辎，静也。圣人终日行道，不离其静与重也. Yixuan notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s *Dongjing Fu* cites Xue Zong’s annotation: *\"Zīzhòng, chē yě.\"* 辎重，车也, and Li Shan’s annotation: *\"Zhāng Jí yuē: ‘Zīzhòng, yǒu yī zhī chē yě.’\"* 张楫曰：「辎重，有衣之车也。」 This suggests the noble person remains as though within a covered carriage to nurture stillness—it does not mean *zī* 辎 itself signifies stillness. The commentary’s interpretation is flawed.\nXu Zi states: According to ancient glosses, *\"zī\"* 辎 was never defined as *\"jìng\"* 静... The *Wen Xuan* annotations are superior to the gloss *\"zī, jìng yě\"* 辎，静也.\nThe terms *\"zīzhòng\"* 辎重, *\"róng guān\"* 荣观, *\"yàn chǔ\"* 燕处, and *\"wàn shèng zhī zhǔ\"* 万乘之主 are all parallel in structure.\nQian Zhi notes: Hong and Xu’s arguments are sound. Fang Risheng’s *Yunhui Xiaobu* cites: The *Shuowen* defines *\"zī\"* 辎 as *\"píng chē, qián yī chē, hòu cóng chē, zī shēng\"* 軿车，前衣车，后从车，甾声, with Xu Shen adding: *\"Suǒwèi kù chē\"* 所谓库车. The *Zilin* states: *\"Zài yīwù chē, qián hòu jiē bì\"* 载衣物车，前后皆蔽. The *Zuozhuan*’s *Xuan 12* *Zhengyi* cites the *Shuowen*: *\"Zī, yī míng píng, qián hòu bì yě\"* 辎，一名軿，前后蔽也. The *Hou Hanshu*’s *Yu Fu Zhi* annotation reads: *\"Píng chē yǒu yī bì wú hòu yuán zhě, wèi zhī zī\"* 軿车有衣蔽无后辕者，谓之辎. The *Shiming* states: *\"Zī, píng yě. Yǒu dǐ yuē zī, wú dǐ yuē píng\"* 辎，屏也。有邸曰辎，无邸曰軿. The *Guangwu Ji* annotation cites the *Shiming*: *\"Zī, yě. Wèi jūn liáng shíwù zá zài zhī, yǐ qí léi zhòng, gù chēng zīzhòng\"* 辎，也。谓军粮什物杂载之，以其累重，故称辎重. The *Qian Han Shu*’s *Han Anguo Zhuan* reads *\"jī zīzhòng\"* 击辎重, with Yan Shigu noting: *\"Zī wèi yī chē, zhòng wèi zài zhòngwù chē, gù xíngzhě zhī zī, zǒng yuē zīzhòng\"* 辎谓衣车，重谓载重物车，故行者之资，总曰辎重. (Volume 2)\nFang’s research is thorough: *Zīzhòng* 辎重 refers to a covered wagon carrying supplies, enclosed front and rear, laden with weight—hence the term. In antiquity, ceremonial processions used passenger carriages, while military marches employed war chariots, both followed by *zīzhòng* 辎重 wagons. This metaphor illustrates that the noble person’s daily conduct must always be rooted in weightiness, never acting recklessly.\n*Though there be splendid vistas, they dwell in tranquil detachment.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Yàn chǔ\"* 燕处 appears as *\"yàn chǔ\"* 宴处 in the Wang Bi and Fu Yi versions.\nQian Zhi notes: The current Wang Bi edition writes *\"yàn\"* 燕; the *Yuzhu*, *Jingfu*, and *Guan* editions also use *\"yàn\"* 燕. The *Shiwen* lists *\"yàn\"* 宴: *\"Yú jiàn fǎn, Jiǎnwén yún: ‘Wèi jìng sī zhī suǒ yàn jū yě.’\"* 于见反，简文云：「谓静思之所宴居也。」 The *Wen Xuan*’s *You Tiantai Shan Fu* annotation concurs.\n*How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat the world lightly with his own person?*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Rúhé\"* 如何 appears as *\"nàihé\"* 奈何 in other editions; *\"yǐ shēn\"* 以身 includes an *\"ér\"* 而 above *\"yǐ\"* 以 in other versions.\nJiao Hong states: *\"Nàihé\"* 奈何 appears as *\"rú zhī hé\"* 如之何 in ancient editions.\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan ancient editions both read *\"rú zhī hé\"* 如之何, though the *\"zhī\"* 之 may be superfluous. *\"Nàihé\"* 奈何 is likely a gloss, as the *Qiang Ben Chengshu*’s commentary reads *\"rúhé nàihé yě\"* 如何奈何也—this serves as evidence.\n*Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the lord.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Qīng zé shī chén\"* 轻则失臣 appears as *\"shī běn\"* 失本 in Wang Bi and *\"shī gēn\"* 失根 in the *Dayian*.\nQian Zhi notes: The correct text should read *\"qīng zé shī gēn, zào zé shī jūn\"* 轻则失根，躁则失君, forming a parallel with the opening line *\"zhòng wèi qīng gēn, jìng wèi zào jūn\"* 重为轻根，静为躁君.\n\nThe Suizhou edition, Fu edition, and Fan edition all render *\"shī chén\"* 失臣 as *\"shī běn\"* 失本.\nBi Yuan states: Wang Bi follows the *Heshang Gong* edition in reading *\"qīng zé shī chén\"* 轻则失臣.\nFan Yingyuan says: The character *\"běn\"* 本 is consistent with the ancient editions of Yan Zun and Wang Bi. The *Heshang Gong* edition reads *\"qīng zé shī chén\"* 轻则失臣, which does not cohere with the preceding text; the ancient edition should be followed.\nMa Xulun says: The original *Laozi* text reads *\"gēn\"* 根. The character *\"gēn\"* 根 was corrupted into *\"mù\"* 木 through scribal omission, and later scholars emended it to *\"běn\"* 本 to suit the meaning.\nFurthermore, the *Yongle Dadian* preserves Wang Bi’s reading *\"qīng zé shī gēn\"* 轻则失根, and Wu Cheng, Jiao Hong, Li Zhi, and Shi Deqing’s editions all concur.\nYu Yue says: This should be followed. The opening of this chapter reads *\"zhòng wèi qīng gēn, jìng wèi zào jūn\"* 重为轻根，静为躁君, so it concludes with *\"qīng zé shī gēn, zào zé shī jūn\"* 轻则失根，躁则失君, meaning that without heaviness there is no root, and without stillness there is no lord. As for the pairing of *\"jūn\"* 君 and *\"chén\"* 臣, this was a later interpolation by those who exalted the ruler and does not reflect the original *Laozi* text.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Rhyme Readings* notes:\n*\"gēn\"* 根 and *\"jūn\"* 君 rhyme (Wen rhyme group);\n*\"xíng\"* 行 and *\"zhòng\"* 重 rhyme (Yang and Dong rhyme groups, with *\"zhòng\"* 重 rhyming as *\"zhái wáng\"* 宅王);\n*\"guān\"* 观 and *\"rán\"* 然 rhyme (Yuan rhyme group, with *\"guān\"* 观 pronounced as *\"juān\"* 涓);\n*\"zhǔ\"* 主 and *\"xià\"* 下 rhyme (Hou and Yu rhyme groups, with *\"zhǔ\"* 主 rhyming as *\"zhǔ\"* 渚).\n*\"chén\"* 臣 and *\"jūn\"* 君 rhyme (Dong and Zhen rhyme groups).\nQian Zhi notes: Gao Benhan concurs.\n*\"xíng\"* 行 belongs to the Yang rhyme group, *\"zhòng\"* 重 to the Dong rhyme group, with Yang and Dong being interchangeable.\n*\"chén\"* 臣 belongs to the Zhen rhyme group, *\"jūn\"* 君 to the Wen rhyme group, with Wen and Zhen being interchangeable.\nHowever, *\"shī chén\"* 失臣 should follow the *Yongle Dadian*’s reading of *\"shī gēn\"* 失根 to correspond with the opening line, with *\"gēn\"* 根 and *\"jūn\"* 君 forming a rhyme.\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* edition contains forty-six characters; the *Guan* edition notes \"thirty-six characters\" at the end of the chapter, where \"thirty\" is a corruption of \"○.\"\nThe *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions contain forty-seven characters; the Fu and Fan editions contain forty-nine.\nThe *Heshang Gong* edition titles this chapter *\"Zhòng Dé Dì Èrshíliù\"* 重德第二十六; the Wang Bi edition titles it *\"Dì Èrshíliù Zhāng\"* 二十六章; the Fan edition titles it *\"Zhòng Wèi Qīng Gēn Zhāng Dì Èrshíliù\"* 重为轻根章第二十六.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\n*Good traveling leaves no wheel tracks;*\nLuo Zhenyu says: The *Jingfu* edition includes the character *\"zhě\"* 者 after *\"xíng\"* 行, and similarly after *\"shàn yán\"* 善言, *\"shàn jiào\"* 善教, *\"shàn bì\"* 善闭, and *\"shàn jié\"* 善结. The *Guangming* edition concurs.\nQian Zhi notes: The Muromachi edition also concurs.\nYan Kejun says: *\"Zhé jì\"* 辙迹 appears as *\"chè jì\"* 彻迹 in the *Heshang Gong* edition and as *\"chè jì\"* 彻迹 in Wang Bi’s edition.\nEmperor Jianwen of Liang states: It should have the *\"chē\"* 车 radical; the current *\"chì\"* 彳 radical is due to the scarcity of ancient characters.\nWu Yun says: *\"Zhé\"* 辙 appears as *\"chè\"* 彻 in the Fu edition.\nLu’s *Baojing Shīwén Kǎoyì* notes: The *Shuowen* lacks the character *\"zhé\"* 辙. The *Zhuangzi*, *Zhanguo Ce*, and *Shiji* all use *\"yì\"* 轶 for *\"zhé\"* 辙.\nNote: *\"Yì\"* 轶 is a loan character; the proper form should be *\"zhé\"* 辙.\nQian Zhi notes: In the *Laozi*, the characters *\"chè\"* 彻 and *\"zhé\"* 辙 have distinct meanings. Chapter Seventy-Nine reads *\"wú dé sī chè\"* 无德司彻, using *\"chè\"* 彻, while this chapter reads *\"shàn xíng wú zhé jì\"* 善行无辙迹, using *\"zhé\"* 辙.\nThe *Gǔ Wén Sìshēng Yùn* by Xia Song, volume five, cites the ancient *Laozi* with *\"chè\"* 彻 written as ○ and *\"zhé\"* 辙 as ○, where *\"zhé\"* 辙 denotes wheel tracks.\nPeng Song’s *Shīwén* states: *\"Zhé\"* 辙 is pronounced as *\"lǐ zhí liè\"* 李直列切, meaning the ruts left by wheels rolling over the ground.\n\n\"Good words bear no blemish,\" Wang Bi annotates as *\"xiá zhé\"* 瑕谪. The *Imperial Commentary* and Heshang Gong’s version render it as *\"xiá\"* 瑕 [lacuna]. Yan Kejun states: *\"Jiǎ\"* 瘕 appears as a variant; the Yizhou edition concurs. Wu Yun notes: \"Without blemish,\" modern editions use the vulgar character. Qian Zhi observes: The *Shiwen* lists *\"zhé\"* 谪, and *\"zhé\"* 谪 is also acceptable. Yang Xiong’s *Fangyan*, chapter three, defines *\"zhé\"* 谪 as \"anger,\" with Guo Pu’s annotation: \"mutual reproach and anger.\" Furthermore, Xia Song’s *Gǔ Wén Sìshēng Yùn*, volume three, cites the ancient *Laozi* with *\"zhé\"* 谪 written as ○, while the Palace and Suizhou editions render it as *\"shì\"* 适. All denote flaws in jade.\n\nThe *Guanzi*, *Shui Di* chapter, states: \"In jade, both *\"xiá\"* 瑕 and *\"shì\"* 适 are visible.\" Gao Heng comments: *\"Xiá\"* 瑕 signifies refinement. Yin’s annotation: *\"Xiá shì\"* 瑕适 are jade flaws. The *Xunzi*, *You Zuo* chapter, reads: *\"Xiá shì bìng jiàn\"* 瑕适并见, meaning \"truth.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*, *Ju Nan* chapter, similarly states \"without flaw,\" as *\"xiá\"* 瑕 and *\"shì\"* 适 were interchangeable in antiquity; *\"tì\"* 瓋 is a later specialized character. The *Wu Xia* chapter states: \"Even a jade inch long must have *\"tì xiá\"* 瓋瑕,\" where *\"shì\"* 适 and *\"cī\"* 疵 are synonymous with flaws or defects.\n\n\"Good reckoning requires no counting rods.\" Yan Kejun notes: *\"Shàn jì\"* 善计 appears as *\"shàn shǔ\"* 善数 in Wang Bi’s edition. *\"Chóu cè\"* 筹策 is rendered as *\"chóu suàn\"* 筹算 in the *Imperial Commentary*. Fan Yingyuan states: *\"Shǔ\"* 数 is read in the third tone. Wang Bi and Yan Zun follow the ancient text, while Heshang Gong uses *\"jì\"* 计. Luo Zhenyu observes: The Heshang Gong, Jinglong, *Imperial Commentary*, British, Guangming, and Jingfu editions all use *\"jì\"* 计. In *\"chóu cè\"* 筹策, the *Imperial Commentary* and British edition write *\"cè\"* 策 as *\"suàn\"* 算. Qian Zhi notes: The *Taiping Yulan*, volume 659, also uses *\"suàn\"* 算, while the Palace edition writes it as ○.\n\nThe *Lunyu*, *Ba Yi* chapter, *Jijie* annotation states: \"Excessive drinking is rare,\" with the *Shiwen* gloss: *\"chóu\"* 筹 is a counting rod. Zhu Junsheng remarks: *\"Suàn\"* 算, six inches long, is used for calendrical reckoning. Composed of *zhú* 竹 and *nòng* 弄, it signifies that constant handling prevents errors. The character is also written as *\"chóu\"* 筹.\n\nThe skilled at securing use no bolts nor bars, yet none can open;\nYan Kejun notes: \"None can open\" — all editions include *\"er\"* 而 above *\"bu\"* 不, and the following clause is the same.\nSun Kuang states: *\"Jian\"* 键 is now written as *\"jiàn\"* 楗.\nJi Yun observes: The original text had *\"jiàn\"* 楗 as *\"jiàn\"* 键.\nQian Zhi notes: *\"Guānjiàn\"* 关键 is a compound; the Fu Yi edition writes *\"jiàn\"* 键.\nThe *Huainanzi*, *Sayings of Mountains*, quotes: \"The skilled at securing use no bolts nor bars,\" and the *Dao and Its Power* chapter also writes *\"jiàn\"* 键.\nFan Yingyuan says: *\"Jiàn\"* 楗 is the wooden bar for doors; some add the *\"jīn\"* 金 radical, which is incorrect. The horizontal is called *\"guān\"* 关, the vertical *\"jiàn\"* 楗.\nFu Yi states: The ancient character is written as ○.\nQian Zhi notes: Writing it as ○ is correct. *\"Guān\"* 关, per the *Shuowen*: \"A wooden bar placed horizontally to secure doors and gates, from *mén* 门, with ○ as phonetic.\" The *Huainanzi*, *Surveying Obscurities*, states: \"City gates are not barred,\" which is the original meaning of *\"guān\"* 关. Here, it extends to mean the horizontal bar for closing doors. ○ is a Chu dialect term in the *Laozi*, a loan for *\"jiàn\"* 楗.\nThe *Fangyan*, volume 5: \"Door keys, east of the Pass, in the regions of Chen and Chu, are called *jiàn* 键, and the character is also written as ○.\" Now, ○ is the ancient form. The *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn*, volume 3, by Xia Song, cites the ancient *Laozi* as writing ○.\n\nThe skilled at binding use no cords nor knots, yet none can undo.\nQian Zhi notes: *\"Shéngyuē\"* 绳约 is a compound. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Shéng\"* 绳 is rope; *\"yuē\"* 约 is binding. The *Zhuangzi*, *Webbed Toes*, says: \"Relying on cords, knots, glue, and lacquer for firmness is an encroachment on virtue.\" *\"Yuē\"* 约 also means rope; *\"shéngyuē\"* 绳约 is akin to modern \"cord and rope.\" The *Zuozhuan*, Duke Ai 11, records Gongsun Hui saying: \"People use *xún* 寻 of rope, but Wu people have short hair,\" with Du Yu’s note: *\"Yuē\"* 约 is rope. The *Yili*, *Jì Xī Jì*, states: *\"Yuē suí yuē pèi\"* 约绥约辔, with Zheng Xuan’s note: *\"Yuē\"* 约 is rope. Old commentaries take *\"yuē\"* 约 as the *\"yuē\"* 约 of restraint, which does not align with the ancient meaning of the *Laozi*.\n\nThus, the sage is ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none;\nEver skilled at saving things, and so discards nothing.\nThis is called inheriting enlightenment.\nYan Kejun notes: \"And so discards none\" — all editions write *\"gù\"* 故 for *\"ér\"* 而, and the following clause is the same.\nSun Kuang’s *Gǔjīn Běn Kǎozhèng* states: The four lines \"Ever skilled at saving people\" are absent in one edition. *\"Gù\"* 故 is written as *\"ér\"* 而 in one version.\nChao Yuezhi says: \"Ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none; ever skilled at saving things, and so discards nothing\" — only the Heshang Gong edition preserves this, while ancient editions lack it. We rely on Fu Yi’s clarification.\nTōjō Ittō notes: According to Fu Yi, the twenty characters from \"Thus\" to \"discards nothing\" are unique to the Heshang Gong edition, absent in ancient editions. Chao Yuezhi’s postscript cites this to refute Wang’s view. Initially, I took this as credible, but upon checking the *Huainanzi*, *Dao and Its Power*, which quotes the *Laozi*: \"People discard no people; things discard no things — this is called inheriting enlightenment.\" From this, even Fu Yi’s ancient edition cannot be taken as definitive.\n\nThe good are the teachers of the not-good;\nThe not-good are the resources of the good.\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Gù shànrén\"* 故善人 — the *Imperial Commentary* and *Yongle Dadian* write *\"gù shànrén\"* 故善人, while Heshang Gong writes *\"gù shànrén zhě\"* 故善人者. *\"Bùshànrén\"* 不善人 — Heshang Gong adds *\"zhě\"* 者 after *\"shànrén\"* 善人.\nJiang Xichang notes: The *Huainanzi*, *Dao and Its Power*, quotes the latter clause as: \"The not-good are the resources of the good,\" with no *\"zhě\"* 者 but two *\"yě\"* 也. Wang Bi’s commentary: \"Thus, the not-good are what the good take as resources,\" suggesting Wang’s edition matches the *Huainanzi*.\nThose who do not value their teachers,\nNor cherish their resources —\nQian Zhi notes: The *Qúnshū Zhìyào* in the Japanese Tenmei edition writes *\"guì qí shī\"* 贵其师, with a marginal note: \"The old edition lacked the three characters *'guì qí shī'* 贵其师; they have been added.\" Without the *\"bù\"* 不, the text reads: \"Value their teachers, do not value their resources,\" which better suits the meaning. This aligns with the earlier line \"The not-good are the resources of the good\" and the theme of \"Ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none.\" Heshang Gong’s commentary on *\"bù guì qí shī\"* 不贵其师: \"Alone, without aid,\" and on *\"bù ài qí zī\"* 不爱其资: \"Without use.\" Lacking aid and use seems to favor the reading: \"Value their teachers, do not value their resources,\" which better fits the meaning.\nThough wise, are greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Suī zhī\"* 虽知 — Heshang Gong and Wang Bi write *\"suī zhì\"* 虽智. *\"Cǐ wèi\"* 此谓 — all editions write *\"shì wèi\"* 是谓.\nQian Zhi notes: The Dunhuang and Fu Yi editions match this stone inscription. *\"Yàomiào\"* 要妙 is also *\"yòumiào\"* 幼妙, synonymous with *\"yōumiào\"* 幽妙. The *Hanshu*, *Annals of Emperor Yuan*, states: \"Exhausting the profound and subtle,\" with Yan Shigu’s note: *\"Yòumiǎo\"* 幼眇 is read as *\"yàomiào\"* 要妙. Liu Taihong says: *\"Yòu\"* 幼 means *\"yōu\"* 幽; *\"miǎo\"* 眇 means *\"wēi\"* 微. The ancient characters *\"yòu\"* 幼 and *\"yǎo\"* 窈 are interchangeable. The *Erya*: *\"Míng\"* 冥 is *\"yòu\"* 幼, with some editions writing *\"yǎo\"* 窈. Sun Yan’s commentary: \"The deep and dark *\"yǎo\"* 窈.\" (*Hanxue Shiyi*, in *Liu Duanlin’s Collected Works*, volume 7) Thus, *\"yàomiào\"* 要妙 means *\"yōumiào\"* 幽妙. The *Huainanzi*, *Original Warp*: \"To fathom the essential and subtle.\" The *Chuci*, *Far-off Journey*: \"Spirits profound and subtle in their wanderings,\" with collected commentaries: *\"Yàomiào\"* 要妙 means \"deep and distant.\"\n\nThis is indeed the case.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis reads: *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解 rhyme (in the *zhi* 支 rhyme group; *zhé* 谪 is pronounced *dí*, *cè* 策 as *chì*, and *jiě* 解 as *jī*). *Shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, and *mí* 迷 rhyme (in the *zhi* 脂 rhyme group).\n\nXī Diāo: *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, *kāi* 开, and *jiě* 解 rhyme; *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, and *mí* 迷 rhyme. *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策 rhyme; *kāi* 开 and *jiě* 解 rhyme; *rén* 人, *rén* 人, *wù* 物, and *wù* 物 rhyme; *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *mí* 迷, and *miào* 妙 rhyme.\n\nGāo Běnhàn and Chén Zhù: *jì* 迹, *zé* 則, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解 rhyme, though *jì* 迹 does not rhyme. *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策, *kāi* 开 and *jiě* 解 are divided into two rhyme groups, in agreement with Chén.\n\nDèng Tíngzhēn: *jì* 迹 and *zé* 則—\nZhū Jùnshēng states: The character *cè* 策 in the *Laozi* is skillfully used to rhyme with *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解.\nJiāng Yǒugào says: *Jiě* 解 has three pronunciations: *húmǎi*, *jiāmǎi*, and *gǔmǎi*. Given that ancient Chinese had entering tones, it should be grouped with the *mài* 麦 rhyme group. The *Laozi*’s line \"善键无绳约而不可解\" rhymes *jiě* 解 with *jì* 迹 and *cè* 策 (*Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng*, *Twelve Rhymes of the Xiè* 蟹 group). *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策 thus belong to the entering tones of the *zhi* 支 and *jiā* 佳 rhyme groups.\n\nThe *Shījīng*, *Yǐn Wǔ*: \"勿予祸适，稼穑匪解.\" *Shì* 适 and *jiě* 解 rhyme, serving as evidence. Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *Jiě* 解 belongs to the *xiè* 蟹 rhyme group, as the rising tone of the *zhi* 支 and *jiā* 佳 groups.\n\nAs for the first character *jì* 迹 in this chapter, Duàn Yùcái’s *Phonological Tables* also classifies it here, suggesting it should rhyme. However, *jì* 迹 is phoneticized by *yì* 亦, and *yì* 亦’s ancient pronunciation lies in the *yú* 鱼 and *yú* 虞 rhyme groups, not this one. Duàn’s inclusion here stems from the *zhòuwén* 籀文 form of *jì* 迹, written as *sù* 速 (phoneticized by *shù* 束), whose ancient pronunciation lies in this rhyme group. Yet the *Shuōwén* explicitly states \"从辵，亦声,\" making it indisputably a *yú* 鱼/*yú* 虞 rhyme group character. Using the *zhòuwén*’s *shù* 束 phonetic for the small seal’s *yì* 亦-based form feels forced. Thus, I hesitate to treat *jì* 迹 as rhyming and record this discussion here for further inquiry.\n\nUpon closer examination, the opening line should indeed rhyme. Likely, the ancient text used *sù* 速 (from *shù* 束), but later copyists replaced it with the small seal form, inadvertently altering the rhyme. The *Zhōu* 周-era *zhùxiàshǐ* 柱下史 would have recognized only the ancient *zhòuwén* 籀 script. The *Shǐjì*, *Tàishǐgōng Zìxù*: \"桀、纣失其道而汤、武作，周失其道而春秋作，秦失其道而陈涉发迹.\" Here, *jì* 迹 rhymes with *zuò* 作, clearly placing it in the *yú* 鱼/*yú* 虞 rhyme group. Perhaps the *zhòuwén*’s *sù* 速 (from *shù* 束) shifted into the level-tone *zhī* 支 group, while the seal script’s *jì* 迹 (from *yì* 亦) shifted into the level-tone *yú* 鱼 group—reflecting the phonetic divergence between *zhòu* 籀 and seal scripts.\n\nJìn-dynasty Méi Táo’s *Yuàn Shī Xíng* 怨诗行 rhymes *jì* 迹 with *hè* 壑, *kè* 客, and *pò* 魄, showing that post-Hàn usage never placed *jì* 迹 in the *zhī* 支 rhyme group.\n\n**[Textual Notes]**\nThe *Jǐnglóng* 景龙 stele contains eighty-nine characters in this chapter. The Dūnhuáng 敦煌 manuscript lacks the full chapter, leaving the character count unclear. The *Héshànggōng* 河上 and Wáng 王 versions have ninety-one characters; the Fù 傅 version, ninety-seven; the Fàn 范 version omits the eight characters \"而不可开\" and \"而不可解,\" totaling eighty-seven. The *Héshànggōng* version titles it \"巧运第二十七,\" the Wáng version \"二十七章,\" and the Fàn version \"善行章第二十七.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nKnow its masculine, guard its feminine,\nand be the world’s *xī* 溪.\nYán Kějūn states: \"为天下溪\" appears as \"溪\" in all editions. The *Shìwén* 释文 notes: \"溪, or written as *xī* 溪.\"\nLuó Zhèn yù says: The *Jǐngfú* 景福 edition also writes \"溪,\" while the *Jǐnglóng* 景龙 edition has \"蹊,\" and the Dūnhuáng 敦煌 edition \"奚,\" with identical usage below.\nQiān Zhī’s note: \"奚\" is correct. The *Zhuāngzǐ*, *Tiānxià* 天下 chapter, and *Huáinánzǐ*, *Dào Yìng* 道应 chapter, both quote it as \"溪,\" possibly a later emendation based on a miswritten *Lǎozǐ* character.\n*Xī* 溪, per the *Yùpiān* 玉篇: \"诘难切, identical to *xī* 溪.\" The *Shuōwén*: \"溪: a mountain stream with no outlet, from 谷, phoneticized by 奚.\" While this could symbolize humble virtue, it duplicates the meaning of \"为天下谷\" below. If written as \"蹊,\" it lacks meaning.\nThe Dūnhuáng Dīng manuscript writes \"奚,\" an ancient term for servants or slaves. The *Zhōulǐ*, *Tiānguān* 天官 chapter’s \"序官\" lists \"奚三百人,\" with the note: \"In ancient times, men and women convicted of crimes were enslaved by the state; the more capable were called *xī* 奚.\" \"为天下奚\" thus means \"to be the world’s servant,\" aligning perfectly with the principle of knowing the masculine while guarding the feminine.\nBe the world’s *xī* 溪,\nwith constant virtue unsevered,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Dūnhuáng manuscript omits \"为天下溪.\"\nQiān Zhī’s note: The Suìzhōu 遂州 edition also does not repeat this line; the same applies below.\n\nKnow its brightness, guard its darkness,\nand be the world’s model.\nConstantly attain flawlessness,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nWèi Jiàsūn states: \"为天下式\" is not repeated, likely due to omission, as the preceding \"溪\" and \"谷\" lines are both repeated. The *Yùzhù* 御注 version repeats all three.\nSūn Kuàng’s *Gǔjīn Běnkǎo Zhèng* 古今本考正: The repeated lines \"为天下式\" etc. are absent in one edition.\nYán Kějūn states: \"常得不忒\" appears as \"常德\" in all editions.\nQiān Zhī’s note: \"忒\" is written as \"贷\" in the Dūnhuáng manuscript.\n\n\"Note that '贷' is a loan character for '忒.' The *Lǐjì: Yuèlìng* states, '毋有差贷,' meaning 'let there be no deviation or error.' Zhāng Bǐnglín’s *Xīn Fāngyán* says: 'The commentary on *Yuèlìng* reads, \"不贷 means no excess or error. 贷 was originally written as 忒.\" Today, people use 忒 to mean \"excess,\" as in \"too long\" (忒长) or \"too short\" (忒短), and it also corresponds to 泰 in common speech, a shift in pronunciation.'\n\nKnow its glory, guard its disgrace,\nand be the world’s valley.\nBe the world’s valley,\nwith constant attainment of sufficiency,\nreturning to simplicity.\n\nYán Kějūn states: '常得乃足' appears as '常德' in all editions. '于朴' is written as '扑' in the *Yùzhù* version, while Wáng Bì’s edition has '朴,' and the same applies below.\"\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Jǐnglóng and Jǐngfú editions both read '朴,' and the same follows below.\nYì Shùndǐng states: This chapter contains interpolations by later hands and does not entirely reflect the original text of Lǎozǐ. The *Zhuāngzǐ: Tiānxià* quotes Lǎodān as saying: 'Know its masculinity, guard its femininity, and be the world’s stream. Know its brightness, guard its disgrace, and be the world’s valley.' This is the original text of Lǎozǐ. It originally paired 'femininity' with 'masculinity' and 'disgrace' with 'brightness.' Disgrace carries the meaning of blackness, as seen in the *Yílǐ* commentary: 'To dye white into black is called disgrace.' This preserves an ancient meaning. Later scholars, unaware that 'disgrace' could pair with 'brightness,' assumed only 'black' could oppose 'brightness' and only 'glory' could oppose 'disgrace.' Thus, they inserted 'guard its blackness' after 'know its brightness' and added 'know its glory' before 'guard its disgrace.' They further appended four lines—'be the world’s model, be the world’s model, with constant virtue unerring, returning to the boundless'—to harmonize with the 'black' rhyme, making the alterations glaringly obvious.\n\nThe first clear sign is their ignorance of the ancient pairing of 'disgrace' with 'brightness,' a usage from the Zhōu to Hàn dynasties. The second is the inconsistency of 'be the world’s model' with 'be the world’s stream' and 'be the world’s valley.' 'Stream' and 'valley' share the same meaning, both referring to where water converges, whereas 'model' does not align with them, yet it was forced into rhyme. Wáng Bì already provided commentary for the 'model' and related lines, indicating the interpolation occurred as early as the Wèi and Jìn dynasties. Fortunately, the *Zhuāngzǐ* quotation allows us to reconstruct the original text, which should be urgently corrected to preserve its authentic form.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs it to become a leader of officials.\nYán Kějūn states: In all editions, '散' is followed by '则.' In all editions, '用' is followed by '之则.'\nNote: '朴' appears as '璞' in some versions. The *Yùpiān* quotes Lǎozǐ: 'When 璞 scatters, it becomes vessels.' The *Wénxuǎn: Yǎn Liánzhū* commentary cites *Shīzǐ*: 'The people of Zhèng call unworked jade 璞.'\nThus, the great system remains uncarved.\nYán Kějūn states: All editions read '故大制不割.'\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Dūnhuáng manuscript has '制' as '剬.' '无' in the current Wáng Bì edition appears as '不,' matching the *Yùzhù* and Jǐngfú editions. The *Shìwén* notes '无割,' confirming Wáng Bì’s original text read '无,' which is here restored. The Jǐnglóng and Dūnhuáng editions both read '是以大制无割.'\nNote: The reading '无割' is correct. The Fù and Fàn editions also have '无' instead of '不.'\nFàn Yīngyuán states: 'Yán Zūn and Wáng Bì follow the ancient text, while Hé Shànggōng and popular editions read \"不割.\"'\nYì Shùndǐng states: '不割' should be '无割.' Wáng Bì’s commentary—'with the world’s heart as one’s heart, thus remaining uncarved'—confirms his text read '无.' The *Dàoyìng Xùnzhèng* also reads '大制无割.' The current '不' is a later alteration, influenced by the phrase '方而不割' in the following chapter.\"\n\n[Phonology]\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiāng Shì:\n- *cī* (雌), *xī* (溪), *xī* (溪), *lí* (离), *ér* (儿) rhyme (歌 and 支 in harmony, *lí* approximates *lí* 黎).\n- *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *tè* (忒), *jí* (极) rhyme (之部, *hēi* read as *hū lì* 反, *tè* as *tā lì* 反).\n- *rǔ* (辱), *gǔ* (谷), *gǔ* (谷), *zú* (足), *pǔ* (朴) rhyme (侯部).\nNote: *cī* (雌), *xī* (溪), *ér* (儿) belong to the 支部; *lí* (离) to the 歌部. 歌 and 支 harmonize, as detailed in Chapter Ten.\nGāo Běnhàn: *bái* (白), *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *tè* (忒), *jí* (极) rhyme; *qì* (器), *gē* (割) rhyme.\nTakeuchi Yoshio: *bái* (白), *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *jí* (极) rhyme.\nNote: *bái* (白) had an ancient pronunciation of *bó*; some argue it does not rhyme here. Gāo includes *cī* (雌), *xī* (溪), *lí* (离), *ér* (儿) as rhymes but excludes *xióng* (雄), though the parallel structure of these two sections suggests *bái* should not stand alone as a rhyme.\n\nThe Jǐnglóng stele edition does not divide chapters. This section contains eighty characters; the Dūnhuáng manuscript has seventy-six; the Hé Shànggōng edition, eighty-six; the Wáng Bì edition, eighty-two; and the Fù edition, eighty-five. The Hé Shànggōng edition titles it \"Returning to Simplicity, Chapter Thirty-One,\" the Wáng Bì edition \"Chapter Twenty-Eight,\" and the Fàn edition \"Know Its Masculinity, Chapter Twenty-Eight.\"\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine\nThose who seek to seize and act upon the world—\nI see they will not succeed.\nNote: The Fù, Fàn, Wáng Xīzhī, and Zhào Mèngfǔ editions include '者' after '为之.'\n\nThe *Daoist Canon*'s Song-era compilation by Prefect Zhang, which collates the four commentaries, includes under the phrase \"act upon\" Wang's annotation: \"act upon means to create and act.\" Other Wang editions omit this sentence.\n\nThe world is the sacred vessel—it cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\n\nYan Kejun notes: In the *Great Compendium*, the character *器* (\"vessel\") is followed by *也* (\"also\"). Under \"cannot be acted upon,\" all editions include *也* after *為* (\"act\").\n\nNote by Qian: The Suizhou, Jingfu, and Dunhuang editions all omit *也*. Additionally, above the character *天* (\"world\"), the Fu and Fan editions include *夫* (\"now\"), while the He Shangong and Wang Bi editions do not. Fan Yingyuan states: \"The character *夫* is present in Ruan Ji’s edition, matching the ancient text.\"\n\nYi Shunding says: Below \"it cannot be acted upon,\" there should be the sentence \"it cannot be grasped.\" I present three pieces of evidence to clarify this. The *Wen Xuan*'s \"General Discussion of the Jin Annals\" by Gan Ling升 quotes *Wenzi* citing Laozi: \"The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped, it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\" This is the first piece of evidence.\n\nKing Wang’s commentary states: \"Thus it may be followed but not acted upon, may be penetrated but not grasped.\" Since King Wang’s commentary includes these terms, the original text can be inferred. This is the second piece of evidence.\n\nIn the later chapter sixty-four, it reads: \"Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Therefore, the sage does no acting and so does not ruin, does no grasping and so does not lose.\" \"Does no acting\" corresponds to \"cannot be acted upon,\" and \"does no grasping\" corresponds to \"cannot be grasped.\" Since that passage includes these terms, this passage must as well. This is the third piece of evidence.\n\nClearly, if there is the phrase \"those who grasp it lose it,\" there must first be the phrase \"it cannot be grasped.\" Ma Xulun states: Peng Song引 Huang Maocai曰: \"The world is a sacred vessel—it cannot be acted upon, it cannot be grasped. As for the human body, is it not also a sacred vessel?\" This shows that Huang saw a version containing this sentence.\n\nNote by Qian: The two phrases \"those who act upon it ruin it\" also appear in chapter sixty-four. The *Heguanzi*’s \"Beizhi\" chapter states: \"Thus those who act ruin it; those who govern disorder it.\" This is likely derived from this passage.\n\nNow, things may follow or be followed, may exhale gently or blow forcefully.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"夫物\" (\"now, things\")—all other editions read \"故物\" (\"thus, things\"). Note by Qian: The Suizhou and Dunhuang editions match this stone inscription. Also, for \"或嘘\" (\"or exhale gently\"), the Heshang Gong and *Imperial Commentary* editions read \"或呴,\" Wang Bi reads \"或歔,\" the Jingfu edition reads \"或煦,\" and two Dunhuang editions match this stone. Upon examination, the Dunhuang, Jingfu, and Suizhou editions all read \"或嘘,\" which is correct. \"嘘\" and \"吹\" are mutually defining: \"嘘\" means \"to blow gently,\" from the mouth radical with the sound *xu*; \"吹\" means \"to exhale forcefully,\" from the mouth and yawn radicals. The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (vol. 80) cites the *Shuowen* as defining \"嘘\" as \"to blow gently.\" Volume 54 first cites Gu Yewang: \"To exhale from the mouth is called *xu*,\" then the *Shuowen*: \"It is also to exhale.\" While \"吹\" and \"嘘\" both involve exhalation, they differ in intensity. Yi Shunding states: \"The original character for '歔' should be '嘘.' Below, '或强或羸' ('may be strong or weak'), '强' and '羸' are opposites, so '嘘' must also oppose '吹.' The *Yupian*’s mouth radical section treats '嘘' and '吹' as interchangeable, following the *Laozi*. It also cites the *Shenglei*: 'Exhaling forcefully is called *chui* (blow); gently is called *xu* (exhale).' This distinction between *chui* and *xu* reflects the *Laozi*’s ancient meaning. The *Yupian* also includes the character '呴,' citing the *Laozi* as '或呴或吹,' matching the Heshang Gong edition—likely a later vulgar character.\"\n\nFu Yi and Fan Yingyuan’s editions read \"噤\" for \"嘘.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"噤\" matches Yan Zun’s ancient edition, which cites the *Chuci*: \"噤闭而不言\" (\"closed mouth, not speaking\"). Note by Qian: The *Shuowen* defines \"噤\" as \"mouth closed.\" The *Chuci* states: \"Closed mouth is called *jin*.\" Its meaning opposes \"吹.\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* cites the *Daodejing* with \"吹\" written as ○, and \"吹\" and \"噤\" as opposing terms—this interpretation is also plausible.\n\nMay be strong or weak, may be raised or cast down.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"或嬴\" (\"or weak\")—all other editions read \"或赢.\" For \"或接\" (\"or raised\"), the *Imperial Commentary* and Heshang Gong read \"载,\" Wang Bi and Liang Jianwen read \"挫.\" Luo Zhenyu states: For \"或强\" (\"or strong\"), the Dunhuang edition reads \"强.\" For \"或挫\" (\"or cast down\"), the Heshang Gong, *Imperial Commentary*, and Jingfu editions read \"载,\" while the Jinglong and two Dunhuang editions read \"接.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"或强或锉, 或培或堕\" (\"may be strong or filed down, may be cultivated or toppled\")—Yan Zun, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Ruan Ji match the ancient edition. Bi Yuan states: \"堕\" is commonly written as \"隳,\" which is incorrect. Yu Yue states: The Heshang Gong edition reads \"载\" for \"挫,\" with the commentary: \"载 means 'secure'; 隳 means 'precarious.'\" Thus \"载\" and \"隳\" form a pair, consistent with the earlier \"或强或羸.\" However, Wang Bi’s edition reads \"挫,\" which does not distinguish two meanings from \"隳.\" I suspect \"挫\" is a corruption of \"在.\" The seal script for \"在\" resembles ○, hence the error. \"或在或隳\" (\"may be present or toppled\") is equivalent to \"或载或隳.\" \"载\" is phonetically related to ○, while \"在\" is related to 才, and \"或\" is also related to ○ (as in the *Zhoufu* stele’s \"○贵不濡\"). Their sounds being identical, they are interchangeable. Takeuchi Yoshio states: Jia Dayin’s *Shuyi* notes: \"Wang’s edition reads '接' or '隳' for this character\" (cited in the Takikawa edition’s margin). This suggests Wang’s edition originally read \"接,\" not \"挫.\" The Jinglong stele also reads \"接.\" However, \"挫\" and \"接\" are not interchangeable. According to Fan Yingyuan’s *Jijie*, Wang’s edition reads \"培\" or \"堕.\" I believe Wang’s edition originally read \"培,\" which was corrupted to \"接,\" then further to \"挫.\" \"培\" shares the same meaning as in the *Zhuangzi*’s \"培风\" (\"riding the wind\"), signifying \"to ride\" or \"to raise,\" directly opposing \"隳.\" The Heshang Gong edition’s \"载\" also means \"to ride,\" suggesting it was altered based on semantic interpretation. Yu Xingwu states: \"接\" should be read as \"捷\" (\"agile\"). \"接\" and \"捷\" are homophonous and rhyming characters.\n\nThe *Liji·Neize* states, \"接以大牢,\" with the annotation: \"接 is read as 捷.\" In the *Gongyang Zhuan* for the thirty-second year of Duke Xi, \"郑伯接卒\" appears, while the *Zuozhuan* and *Guliang Zhuan* write \"捷.\" In the twelfth year of Duke Zhuang of the *Zuozhuan*, \"宋万弒其君捷\" is recorded, whereas the *Gongyang* writes \"接.\" The *Xunzi·Dalüe* states, \"先事虑事谓之接,\" with the annotation: \"接 is read as 捷.\" In the *Zhuangzi·Renjian Shi*, \"王公必将乘人而斗其捷,\" the *Shiwen* notes: \"捷 is written as 接.\" The *Erya·Shigu* defines: \"捷 means victory.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"The defeat of a city wall is called 隓, in seal script.\" Thus, 堕 carries the meaning of defeat, while 捷 signifies victory—these two stand in direct opposition.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character \"○\" in the stele is an alternative form of \"隳.\" Furthermore, Yu Yue’s view that \"载\" and \"隳\" are opposites, Takeuchi’s view that \"培\" and \"隳\" are opposites, and Yu Xingwu’s view that \"捷\" and \"堕\" are opposites—each of these interpretations clarifies a different aspect, and all are plausible, though Yu’s is the most compelling.\n\nThus, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Hanfeizi·Waichu Shuo Zuoxia* quotes it as \"故君子去泰，去甚.\" The character \"甚,\" as explained in Heshang Gong’s commentary, refers to \"excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures,\" which is correct. The *Shuowen* states: \"甚 means extreme contentment, composed of 甘 (sweetness) and 匹 (pair). 匹 signifies coupling.\" Zhu Junsheng remarks: \"甘 pertains to food and drink, 匹 to male and female—these are humanity’s greatest desires, hence the gloss of extreme contentment.\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads the rhymes as 随, 吹, 羸, and 堕 (all in the 歌 *ge* rhyme group; 吹 is pronounced *cuo*, 羸 as *luo*, and 堕 in the level tone). Xi Diao notes: \"羸\" follows Fan Yingyuan’s edition as \"锉,\" with 随, 吹, 锉, and 堕 forming a rhyme. Deng Tingzhen states: 随, 吹, 羸, and 隓 rhyme, all being ancient 歌 *ge*-group characters. \"随\" was pronounced *suohe* in antiquity, as in the *Lunyu*, where the names of the Eight Disciples rhyme \"随\" with \"騧.\" \"吹\" was pronounced *qu’e*, as in the *Shijing*’s \"风其吹女,\" rhyming with \"和.\" \"羸\" and \"嬴\" share the same pronunciation. \"隓,\" in the modern text of the *Shangshu*’s \"Gaoyao,\" rhymes with \"脞\" and \"惰.\" The character \"‰\" was read similarly in antiquity.\n\nThe Jinglong stele does not divide chapters; it contains fifty-seven characters, matching the Dunhuang version. The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions have fifty-eight characters, while the Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan editions have sixty. The Heshang Gong edition titles this \"无为第二十九\" (*Wuwei*, Chapter 29), the Wang Bi edition \"二十九章\" (Chapter 29), and the Fan Yingyuan edition \"将欲章第二十九\" (*Jiang Yu*, Chapter 29).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 30**\nOne who governs as a ruler through the Dao does not rely on military force to dominate the world.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"以道作\" appears as \"以道佐\" in all other editions. Luo Zhenyu notes: The Jingfu edition omits \"者,\" and \"强\" is followed by \"于.\" The Dunhuang edition writes \"强\" as \"强,\" also including \"于.\" Ma Xulun remarks: Wang Bi’s commentary states, \"尚不可以兵强于天下,\" indicating his edition also included \"于.\" Tōjō Ichidō observes: The *Chen Gui*’s *Shou Dao* chapter quotes \"强\" with \"于,\" aligning with Wang Bi’s commentary. Yu Yue argues: The Jinglong stele reads \"以道作人主者,\" which is the ancient version. Heshang Gong’s commentary states, \"谓人主能以道自辅佐也,\" confirming his edition also used \"作.\" If it were \"以道佐人主,\" it would imply a minister aiding the ruler with the Dao—how could this refer to the ruler governing through the Dao? The error arose from the similarity of \"作\" and \"佐,\" compounded by the commentary’s use of \"辅佐.\" Wang Bi’s edition already had \"佐,\" hence his note: \"以道佐人主，尚不可以兵强于天下，况人主躬于道者乎?\" Later editors altered Heshang Gong’s edition to match Wang Bi’s, obscuring the original meaning of Heshang Gong’s commentary.\n\nJiang Xichang contends: No one else has mentioned the Jinglong stele’s \"以道作人主者,\" suggesting Yu Yue’s copy may have been an accidental scribal error, insufficient as evidence.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Zhuang’s argument is incorrect. The original rubbing of the Jinglong stele, as recorded in the *Jiyu Tang Beilu* and *Guben Daodejing Jiaokan Tubo*, along with Yan Kejun’s collation notes, all confirm \"以道作人主者.\" The stele still exists, leaving no room for doubt regarding Yu Yue’s claim. Luo Zhenyu, in his *Daodejing Kaoyi*, wrote: \"In Tieqiao’s *Man Gao*, there is a letter to Xu Xingbo stating, 'While compiling the *Laozi Tangben Kaoyi*, I collated the Yizhou edition, Fu Yi’s edition, the Minghuang commentary edition, and the *Shiwen*—I know Tieqiao once produced a separate collation based on Tang inscriptions.' Yet after thirty years of searching, I could not find it.\" Jiang’s skepticism likely stems from not having seen Yan Kejun’s work or the Jinglong stele, illustrating the challenges of textual scholarship.\n\n**Its consequences will rebound:**\nWei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary omits \"好还,\" and Yan Kejun missed this in his collation.\n\nQian Zhi notes: \"还\" in the *Shiwen* is pronounced *xuan*. Fan Yingyuan states: \"还 is pronounced *xuan*; in classical texts, '旋' and '还' are interchangeable.\" The phrase \"其事好还\" means that the perils of war and conflict will ultimately bring disaster upon oneself.\n\nWhere the army encamps, brambles grow.\n\nYan Kejun notes: All other editions include the character *yan* (焉) after *sheng* (生), and beneath this line, all other editions contain the eight characters \"大军之后，必有凶年\" (*After a great army passes, lean years must follow*). These likely represent a commentary intruding into the main text, which this edition omits. Wang [Shihan] cites the Xingzhou edition as also lacking them.\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: Both the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit the above nine characters.\n\nLao Jian states: The two lines \"大军之后，必有凶年\" (*After a great army passes, lean years must follow*) are absent from the Jinglong, Dunhuang, and Daozang Longxing stele editions, though present in all others. The *Hanshu* records in the \"Biography of Yan Zhu\" that King An of Huainan memorialized: *\"I have heard that after military campaigns, lean years must follow.\"* He further states: *\"This is what Laozi meant by 'Where the army encamps, brambles grow.'\"*\n\nExamining the wording, *\"military campaigns\"* and *\"lean years\"* appear to belong to an ancient saying, not originally from the *Laozi*. Wang Bi’s commentary only states: *\"They harm the people and devastate the fields, hence it is said that brambles grow there.\"* This too suggests the lines were not originally present. Perhaps ancient exegetes commonly cited them, and by coincidence, the characters *huan* (还) and *yan* (焉) happened to rhyme, leading to their erroneous inclusion in the text. Based on the Jinglong and other editions, I provisionally treat them as doubtful.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Hanshu*’s \"Biography of Yan Zhu\" quotes the *Laozi* with *yan* (焉) as *zhi* (之). Yan Shigu comments: *\"These are words from the Daoist scripture.\"* This likely refers to the two lines beginning with *\"Where the army encamps,\"* supporting Lao’s argument. Additionally, the Guangming edition writes *xiong* (凶, \"lean\") as *huang* (荒, \"barren\"), while the imperial commentary uses *xiong* (凶). The *Shiwen* glosses *\"lean years\"* as: *\"Heaven responds with malign qi, disasters befall the five grains, and all people suffer.\"* This collation is appended here.\n\nThus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop—never resorting to force.\n\nYan Kejun states: *\"Thus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop\"*—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions omit the character *gu* (故, \"thus\"), and the *Dayian* edition likewise omits it, while adding *yi* (矣) after *er yi* (而已). In Wang Bi’s edition, *zhe* (者) is written as *you* (有). *\"Never resorting to force\"*—all versions include *gan* (敢, \"dare\") after *bu* (不).\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong, imperial commentary, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions all read *\"Thus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop,\"* while the Guangming edition has *\"The virtuous achieve their ends and stop.\"* *\"Never dare to resort to force\"*—the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit *gan* (敢). In the Dunhuang edition, *qiang* (强, \"force\") is written as *qiang* (强), and the Jingfu edition adds *yan* (焉) at the end of the sentence.\n\nYu Yue comments: The character *gan* (敢) is a superfluous interpolation. Heshang Gong’s commentary states: *\"Not using resolute daring to seize the reputation of strength.\"* The *\"not using\"* in the commentary is drawn from the original text. The *\"resolute daring\"* explains the meaning of *guo* (果, \"achieve\") above and does not imply another *guo* (果) in this passage. The current reading *\"never dare to resort to force\"* is an interpolation influenced by Heshang Gong’s commentary. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: *\"Not using military power to impose strength upon the world,\"* where *\"not using\"* is also a continuous phrase, further proving that *gan* (敢) in the original text is superfluous. The Tang-dynasty Jinglong stele correctly reads *\"never resorting to force,\"* and this should be adopted for emendation.\n\n*\"Having achieved their ends, they do not boast; having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: In the imperial commentary, *jiao* (骄, \"boast\") is written as *jiao* (憍). In all versions, the line *\"having achieved their ends, they do not boast\"* appears after *\"having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt.\"*\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Suizhou, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions also place *\"having achieved their ends, they do not boast\"* before *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt.\"* Additionally, *jiao* (骄) is written as *jiao* (憍) in the Fan and Lou Zheng editions. Yang Shuda remarks: The character *jiao* (憍) is written with the heart radical and is the original form of *jiao* (骄, \"pride\"), though it is not included in the *Shuowen*. *Jiao* (骄) is thus a borrowed character for *jiao* (憍).\n\n*\"Having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully—this is achieving their ends without resorting to force.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: *\"Having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—in all versions, *yi* (以) is written as *yi* (已), and *shi* (是) is omitted. Wei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary includes *shi* (是) after *yi* (已), matching the stele. Yu Yue comments: The Fu Yi edition reads *\"this is achieving their ends without resorting to force,\"* which should be followed. The preceding lines state *\"the virtuous achieve their ends and stop, never resorting to force,\"* and *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not boast; having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—all emphasize *guo* (果, \"achievement\") without mentioning *qiang* (强, \"force\"). Thus, the summary *\"this is achieving their ends without resorting to force\"* directly corresponds to the earlier *\"achieve their ends and stop, never resorting to force.\"* Readers mistakenly assumed this line followed the same pattern as *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt,\"* leading them to erroneously delete *shi* (是). The Tang-dynasty Jinglong stele also includes *shi* (是), and it should be restored.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* states: *\"Guo* (果) means *xin* (信, 'trust').\"* The *Analects* reads: *\"Act with certainty.\"* Miao Xie explains: *\"Guo* means *cheng* (成, 'fulfillment').\"* The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* states *\"the order was not carried out,\"* with the commentary: *\"Guo* means *cheng* (诚, 'sincerity').\"* Laozi’s *\"the virtuous achieve their ends and stop\"* suggests that *guo* (果) primarily signifies *chengxin* (诚信, \"sincerity and trust\"), meaning only sincerity can win people over without resorting to force. Earlier interpretations glossed *guo* (果) as *gan* (敢, \"daring\"), failing to recognize that Laozi teaches *\"not daring\"*—*\"daring leads to destruction, while not daring leads to life.\"* *Gan* (敢) is not Laozi’s original meaning and is superfluous here. *\"Having achieved their ends, they do not boast; they do not vaunt; they do not flaunt\"* all describe the effects of sincerity and trust. Laozi’s text most emphasizes *xin* (信, \"trust\"). Chapter 49 states: *\"Those who are trustworthy, I trust; those who are untrustworthy, I also trust—this is virtuous trust.\"* Chapters 17 and 23 state: *\"Insufficient trust leads to distrust.\"* Resorting to force due to insufficient trust is *\"having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—yet this is merely to fulfill the task. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: *\"Guo* means *ji* (济, 'to accomplish').\"* This is the secondary meaning of *guo* (果). The *Zuozhuan*’s 12th year of Duke Xuan records King Zhuang of Chu saying: *\"It is for the former ruler’s palace, to fulfill the task—military success is not my achievement.\"* This is *\"having achieved their ends without resorting to force.\"* Using force only when unavoidable is to regard victory as no victory, never imposing strength upon the world through arms. Jiang Xichang misunderstood Laozi, claiming *\"guo* means the ability to kill enemies\"*—this is the way of a murderer, not Laozi.\n\n*\"When things become aggressive, they age—this is called contrary to the Dao; what is contrary to the Dao perishes early.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: The imperial commentary, Heshang Gong, and Wang Bi editions read *\"this is called contrary to the Dao; what is contrary to the Dao perishes early,\"* while the Fu Yi edition and Wang’s citation of the Xingzhou edition both read *\"non-Dao.\"* Wei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary writes *mu* (牡, \"aggressive\") as *zhuang* (壮, \"strong\"), matching a line in the *De Jing*. The stele also writes *mu* (牡) in that line, but here *mu* (牡) is an error. Yan’s collation is incomplete.\n\nQian Zhi notes: These three lines also appear in Chapter 55. The stele reads *\"non-Dao\"* here and *\"contrary to the Dao\"* there. The Heshang Gong edition reads *\"contrary to the Dao,\"* while the Suizhou edition has the full line: *\"When things become strong, they age—this is called non-Dao, perishing early.\"* *\"Non-Dao\"* is equivalent to *\"contrary to the Dao.\"* *Yi* (已) is also written as *wang* (亡, \"perish\"). The Gu Huan edition reads *\"contrary to the Dao, perishing early,\"* with the commentary: *\"Wang* means *si* (死, 'death').\"*\n\nWithin the *Huangdi Neijing*, Volume One, Wang Bing’s annotation also reads *\"contrary to the Dao, perishing early,\"* suggesting the ancient text likely wrote *wang* (亡). Furthermore, Yao Nai states: *\"The twelve characters 'When things become strong, they age' are superfluous, having been mistakenly inserted here under the line 'Do not be aggressive' by reciters, when they properly belong below the line 'The heart that drives qi is called forceful' in the 'Embodying Virtue' chapter of the later section.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Rhyme Reading* pairs:\n- *zhe* (者) and *xia* (下) as rhymes (Fish Department, *zhe* read as *zhu*),\n- *huan* (还), *yan* (焉), and *nian* (年) as rhymes (Yuan and Zhen Departments in mixed rhyme, *huan* read as *xuan*, *nian* rhyming with *nulian*).\n\nQian Zhi notes: *huan* and *yan* belong to the Yuan Department, while *nian* belongs to the Zhen Department—this is a mixed rhyme of Yuan and Zhen.\n\nXi Tong pairs *jin* (矜) and *qiang* (强) as rhymes, citing as examples the *Yi Lin* (*Kun* hexagram’s *Lü* line rhyming *liang* and *jin*, *Bi* hexagram’s *Zhong Fu* line rhyming *jin* and *xiang*). He also pairs *lao* (老), *Dao* (道), and *yi* (已) as rhymes, a view shared by Gao Benhan.\n\nGao takes *zhu* (主), *xia* (下), *chu* (处), and *hou* (后) as rhymes, with *huan*, *yan*, and *nian* as secondary rhymes.\n\nQian Zhi notes: *zhu*, *xia*, *chu*, and *hou* do not rhyme—Gao’s claim is erroneous.\n\nThe Jinglong Stele version contains sixty-seven characters; the Dunhuang version matches it. The Heshang Gong and Wang [Bing] editions have seventy-five characters, the Fu [Yi] edition seventy-nine, and the Fan [Yingyuan] edition seventy-eight. The Heshang Gong edition titles this chapter *\"Frugality and Martiality, Thirty,\"* the Wang edition *\"Chapter Thirty,\"* and the Fan edition *\"Using the Dao to Assist the Ruler, Chapter Thirty.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\n*\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang Gong edition omits the character *zhe* (者). In *\"inauspicious tools,\"* the *Datian* edition lacks the two characters *\"zhi qi\"* (之器).\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character *jia* (佳) appears as *mei* (美, \"fine\") in Fu Yi’s edition, as *shi* (饰, \"adorned\") in the Muromachi edition, and as *\"fine and good weapons are inauspicious tools\"* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Biography of Cang Gong*—all later glosses. Song Xiangfeng argues: *\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools\"* should read *\"crafting weapons\"* (*zuo bing*). The *Da Dai Liji*’s *\"On the Use of Arms\"* states: *\"To use arms—is this not inauspicious?\"* and further: *\"The Duke asked, 'Did Chiyou craft weapons?' The Master replied, 'No. Chiyou was a greedy commoner—what tools could he have made?'\"*—evidence for *\"crafting weapons.\"* Some take *jia* as *zhui* (隹), interchangeable with *wei* (惟). The seal script forms of *jia* and *zuo* (作) are close, while *zhui* is distant—it should not be read as *zhui*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The meaning of *\"crafting weapons\"* is also unclear; *jia* should indeed be *zhui*. The Yuan Dynasty’s third year (1309) *Daoist Canon* stele at the Panxi Palace in Baoji County, Shaanxi, writes *jia* as *zhui*—proof (see *Collated Rubbings of Ancient Daoist Canon Versions*).\n\nAdditionally, the two characters *\"zhi qi\"* (之器) are absent in Wu Cheng’s and Wu Mianxue’s editions.\n\nWang Niansun states: The *Shiwen* glosses *jia* as *\"good,\"* while Heshang Gong reads it as *\"adorned.\"* Neither gloss is satisfactory. In antiquity, *\"weapons\"* referred specifically to the Five Arms, hence the saying: *\"Weapons are inauspicious tools.\"* If referring to those who wield arms, one may call them inauspicious, but not *\"inauspicious tools.\"* Here, *jia* should be *zhui*, a scribal error. *Zhui* is the ancient form of *wei* (唯, \"only\")—*wei* may also be written as *wei* (惟) or *wei* (维). *\"Only weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* thus the Daoist does not dwell with them. Above it says *\"only\"* (*fu wei*), below *\"thus\"* (*gu*)—the meaning aligns perfectly. Chapter Eight states: *\"Only through non-contention does one avoid blame.\"* Chapter Fifteen says: *\"Only because it cannot be known is it called profound\"* and *\"Only through non-fullness can one remain whole without renewal.\"* Chapter Twenty-Two declares: *\"Only through non-contention does the world not contend with them.\"* All serve as evidence. In ancient bronze and stone inscriptions, *wei* is written as *zhui*, as in the Stone Drums. The *Ancient Script Four-Tone Rhymes* by Xia Song also records *wei* in the *Dao De Jing* as *zhui*. Thus, all instances of *wei* in modern texts were altered by later hands. Had *zhui* not been mistaken for *jia*, later scholars would surely have changed it to *wei*.\n\nRuan Yuan states: In the *Dao De Jing*, *\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* *jia* is a corruption of *zhui* (同惟). The *Dao De Jing* frequently pairs *\"fu wei\"* (夫唯) as a phrase; if read as *jia*, it should say *\"inauspicious affairs,\"* not *\"tools\"* (*Preface to the Exegesis of Classical and Historical Words*).\n\n*\"Some revile them—thus the Daoist does not dwell with them.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: All editions include *zhe* (者) after *Dao*, and the *Datian* edition adds *ye* (也) after *chu* (处).\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong and Dunhuang editions both omit *zhe*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Chen Xianggu’s *Authentic Exegesis of the Dao De Jing* lacks these two lines.\n\n*\"The noble person values the left in residence, but in warfare, values the right.\"*\n\nNakai Riken states: The ancients all valued the right, hence demotion was called *\"left transfer\"*—there is no evidence of valuing the left, even in the Han. Later officials who valued the left began with the Five Hu’s disruption of China. The Hu valued the left, as their customs dictated (see *Laozi*’s *\"tattooed foreheads\"*).\n\nQian Zhi notes: This is incorrect. The *Zuozhuan*’s eighth year of Duke Huan states: *\"The Chu people esteem the left,\"* aligning with the *Dao De Jing*’s *\"The noble person values the left in residence\"* and *\"Auspicious affairs esteem the left.\"*\n\nAdditionally, the Suizhou edition reads *\"values the aide\"* (貴佐), which is an error for *\"left\"* (左). The Fu [Yi] and Fan [Ye] editions include *\"therefore\"* (是以) before *\"the noble person\"*, as do the Wang Xizhi and Muromachi editions.\n\n*\"Weapons are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person. When unavoidable, they are employed.\"*\n\nWang Dao states: This passage from *\"Weapons are inauspicious instruments\"* onward appears to be an ancient exegetical gloss that, through long transmission, became intermingled with the main text—its meaning makes this evident.\n\nJi Yun remarks: From *\"Weapons are inauspicious instruments\"* to *\"handled with the rites of mourning\"*, this section seems to contain interpolated commentary. However, as both the Heshang Gong commentary and other editions treat it as part of the main text, it is retained here.\n\nLiu Shipei observes: This section lacks commentary in Wang [Bi]’s edition, though ancient commentaries and Wang’s own notes are frequently conflated with the base text. The phrases *\"inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person\"* must be commentary, as *\"not the instruments of the noble person\"* explicates *\"inauspicious instruments\"* above. The original text likely read: *\"Weapons are employed only when unavoidable.\"* The nine characters following *\"Weapons are\"* are all superfluous.\n\nMa Xulun concurs: The arguments of Ji and Liu are sound.\n\nThe *Wenzi*’s *\"Shangren\"* chapter quotes: *\"Weapons are inauspicious instruments; they are employed only when unavoidable.\"* The *Gaoseng Zhuan*’s *Yijie Lun* by Shi Huijiao states: *\"Weapons are inauspicious instruments; they are employed only when unavoidable.\"* The original text of the *Laozi* likely read: *\"Now, weapons are inauspicious instruments; they are employed only when unavoidable.\"* The two lines *\"Some things...\"* belong to chapter twenty-four as misplaced text, while the two lines *\"The noble person...\"* are displaced from below. *\"Not the instruments of the noble person\"* directly glosses *\"inauspicious instruments.\"*\n\n*\"Serenity is prized.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* reads *\"serene and bland\"* (恬淡), Heshang Gong *\"serene and magnanimous\"* (恬恢), another version *\"serene\"* (恬然), and Wang Bi *\"serene and tranquil\"* (恬澹).\n\nLuo Zhenyu observes: The *Shiwen* glosses *\"serene\"* (恬) as *\"alternatively written as 'kuò'\"* (栝). *\"Tranquil\"* (澹) in the current Wang [Bi] edition is written as *\"bland\"* (淡), matching the *Imperial Commentary*, Guangming, and other editions. Heshang Gong’s version reads *\"magnanimous\"* (恢), while the Jianwen, Jinglong, and Dunhuang editions all read *\"indifferent\"* (惔).\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Suizhou edition also reads *\"indifferent\"* (惔), and the Fu [Yi] edition reads *\"placid\"* (憺). The *Shiwen* lists *\"tranquil\"* (澹), noting: *\"Alternatively written as 'indifferent' (惔).\"* Bi Yuan states: The *Shuowen* defines *\"placid\"* (憺) as *\"calm, from the heart, with zhān as phonetic\"* and *\"indifferent\"* (惔) as *\"anxious, from the heart, with yán as phonetic.\"* The *Book of Songs* says: *\"My anxious heart burns like fire.\"* Thus, *\"indifferent\"* (惔) is incorrect.\n\nThus it is not deemed fine; if one deems it fine, this is to delight in ○ others.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary*, Heshang Gong, and Wang Bi versions read *\"triumphing yet not fine, and those who deem it fine,\"* while the *Dayian* edition omits the character *\"and.\"* *\"This is to delight in ○ others\"* appears as *\"this is to delight in killing others\"* in all editions, with the *Dayian* adding *\"also\"* after *\"others.\"*\n\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong and Dunhuang editions both read *\"thus it is not fine\"* for *\"triumphing yet not fine.\"* For *\"and those who deem it fine,\"* the Jinglong edition reads *\"if one deems it fine,\"* and the Dunhuang edition reads *\"if one deems it fine, one must delight in it.\"* The Jingfu edition includes *\"also\"* after *\"others\"* in *\"this is to delight in killing others.\"*\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Fu [Yi] edition renders these lines as: *\"Thus it is not fine; if one deems it fine, one must delight in it. Those who delight in it delight in killing others.\"* The Fan [Ye] edition includes *\"it\"* after *\"if one deems fine,\"* with the rest identical. The Shichō edition reads: *\"Triumphing yet not fine, and those who deem it fine delight in killing others.\"* The Suizhou edition matches the Dunhuang version, though the *\"○\"* character is written as *\"kill\"* in the Fu [Yi] edition, while the Dunhuang edition retains *\"○.\"*\n\nNote: *\"○\"* is a vulgar character of the time. The *Guangyun* states: *\"'○' is the vulgar form of 'kill.' This character appears in the* Baihutong.*\" Additionally, the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read *\"triumphing yet not fine,\"* which, including the character *\"triumph,\"* is contextually superior.\n\nLi Daochun comments: *\"Triumphing yet not fine\"*—some suggest *\"thus it is not fine,\"* which is incorrect. The Zhongdu *Four Masters* edition omits the two subsequent lines under *\"triumphing yet not fine.\"*\n\nThose who delight in ○ cannot realize their will in the world.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* reads *\"cannot realize their intent,\"* while Heshang Gong and Wang Bi read *\"then they cannot realize their aspirations in the world,\"* with the *Dayian* omitting *\"then.\"* Luo Zhenyu states: The Wang Bi edition reads *\"those who delight in killing others cannot realize their aspirations in the world,\"* while the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit *\"others.\"* Neither the *Imperial Commentary* nor the three other editions include *\"then\"* or *\"with,\"* and none of the English editions include *\"indeed.\"* *\"Realize aspirations\"* appears as *\"realize intent\"* in both the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Suizhou edition reads *\"those who delight in it cannot realize their intent in the world,\"* while the Fu [Yi] edition reads *\"those who delight in killing others cannot realize their aspirations in the world.\"* The Fan [Ye] edition matches the Fu [Yi] version but omits the first *\"others.\"*\n\nThus, in auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in inauspicious affairs, the right is honored. Therefore, the deputy general stands on the left, and the supreme general stands on the right.\n\nYan Kejun notes: All editions omit *\"thus\"* before *\"in auspicious affairs, the left is honored.\"* *\"Stands on the left\"* appears as *\"resides on the left\"* in the *Imperial Commentary* and *Dayian* editions, with *\"stands on the right\"* similarly rendered as *\"resides on the right.\"* Wei Jiasun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* omits *\"therefore\"* before *\"the deputy general.\"*\n\nLuo Zhenyu states: Both the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions include *\"thus\"* before *\"auspicious,\"* while the Jingfu edition writes *\"honor\"* as *\"elevate\"* (both instances). *\"Inauspicious\"* appears as *\"mourning\"* in the Dunhuang edition. After *\"the right is honored,\"* both the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions include *\"therefore.\"*\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions omit *\"therefore,\"* while the Wang Xizhi, Fu [Yi], and Fan [Ye] editions include it. Additionally, the Fu [Yi] and Fan [Ye] editions replace *\"stands\"* with *\"resides\"* in both instances.\n\nWhen the ○ slain are numerous, mourn them with sorrowful weeping.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions read *\"when the slain are numerous.\"* Above this line, the *Imperial Commentary* and Heshang Gong include six characters—*\"stating that one should handle it with mourning rites\"*—likely a gloss mistakenly incorporated into the main text, which the current edition and *Dayian* omit.\n\nYi Shunding remarks: Wang Bi’s edition uniquely lacks commentary for this chapter, leading Chao Jingxu to doubt whether these were Laozi’s words. Yet this chapter contains Laozi’s profound insights, aligning with the later passage *\"when opposing armies clash, the grieving side prevails.\"* I fail to understand why Chao deemed this erroneous. However, the chapter’s phrasing is somewhat redundant, suggesting ancient commentary may have been mistakenly included. The line *\"stating that one should handle it with mourning rites\"*—with its *\"stating\"*—resembles a commentator’s gloss.\n\nTan Xian notes: An earlier scholar observed that the eight characters *\"after great warfare, there must be famine years\"* were commentary mistakenly inserted. I believe the three lines *\"the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general stands on the right, stating that one should handle it with mourning rites\"* are also commentary. The Yizhou stone edition and *Taiping Imperial Digest* omit *\"stating that one should handle it with mourning rites.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Sorrowful\"* appears as *\"grieving\"* in the Wang Bi edition.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Daozang Wang Bi edition reads *\"sorrowful,\"* which may be used to correct the text. Additionally, *\"weeping\"* has been suggested to be a corruption of *\"preside\"* (莅).\n\nLuo Yunxian states: *\"Weeping\"* should be emended to *\"preside\"* (莅). The *Shuowen* lacks *\"preside\"* (莅), but this character appears in this text’s thirty-second chapter, as well as in the *Rites of Zhou*, *Zuozhuan*, and *Zhuangzi*. The *Shuowen* likely omitted it, and *\"preside\"* (莅) and *\"○\"* were anciently interchangeable. The *Huainanzi*’s *\"Chuzhen Xun\"* commentary cites Laozi’s *\"governing the world with the Dao,\"* where *\"preside\"* (莅) is written as *\"○.\"* The *Shuowen* defines *\"○\"* as *\"to oversee,\"* making *\"preside over it\"* parallel with the following *\"handle it.\"*\n\nThe *Shenjian*’s *Zhengti* states: *\"Distinctions are made through likes and dislikes, governance through joy and anger, and harmony through sorrow and joy,\"* which aligns grammatically with *\"govern it with sorrow and grief.\"* *\"When victorious in war, handle it with mourning rites.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Mourning rites\"* appears as *\"funeral rites\"* in other editions.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Daozang’s *Zhang Taishou Compilation of Four Commentaries* includes at the end of this chapter Wang Bi’s annotation: *\"I suspect this is not the work of Laozi,\"* a line now lost in all extant Wang Bi editions. It appears Wang Bi harbored doubts, hence his omission of commentary. The Heshang Gong edition provides annotations for the passages from *\"Weapons are inauspicious tools\"* to *\"handle it with funeral rites,\"* reflecting a shared textual basis but divergent interpretations. One cannot, therefore, conclude that Heshang Gong’s commentary postdates Wang Bi’s merely on these grounds. Though this chapter contains many interpolations from ancient commentaries, phrases such as *\"Now, weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* *\"Slaying multitudes, govern it with sorrow and grief,\"* and *\"Victorious in war, handle it with mourning rites\"* remain timeless insights—utterances no one but Laozi would dare or could articulate.\n\nHere, I have excised redundancies and emended the received text as follows:\n\nNow, weapons are inauspicious tools—\n*(Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the instruments of the noble person.)*\nThings may despise them, thus one who embodies the Way does not dwell in them.\n*(When their use is unavoidable, equanimity is paramount.)*\n\nThe noble person, in repose, values the left; in warfare, values the right.\n*(Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs, the right. Thus, the deputy general stands to the left, the supreme general to the right.)*\n\nSlaying multitudes, govern it with sorrow and grief.\n*(Victory is not to be celebrated; to celebrate it is to delight in killing. One who delights in killing cannot realize their will in the world.)*\n\nVictorious in war, handle it with mourning rites.\n*(This speaks of ruling in a bygone age, where one handles it with funeral rites.)*\n\n**Translator’s Note:**\n*(The following reconstructs the original passage with the four-character interpolation as indicated, while preserving the textual and phonological analysis.)*\n\nWang Xizhi’s version, along with those of Fu [Yi] and Fan [Ye], reads: *\"‘handle it with mourning rites’—beneath ‘handle,’ the phrase ‘居上势则’ (when in a position of supremacy) appears.\"* Cheng Dachang’s *Yi Lao Tongyan* cites \"世\" (age) in place of \"势\" (power), which may derive from an ancient commentary; this edition restores it accordingly.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nPrevious interpretations deemed this passage too textually disordered to analyze its rhymes. In truth, the chapter rhymes as follows:\n- *者, 器, 恶, 处* (all in the *yu* 部 rhyme group);\n- *右, 之, 为* (all in the *zhi* 部 rhyme group).\n*(Note: 者 was pronounced *zhu* in antiquity; 右, *yi*.)*\nThus, the text’s rhymes align closely, with only the interpolated annotations disrupting the flow.\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele version divides no chapters, totaling 107 characters. The Dunhuang manuscript has 114, the Heshang Gong version 116, Wang Bi’s 117, Fu Yi’s 133, and Fan Ye’s 134. The Heshang Gong edition titles this *\"Yan Wu Di San Shi Yi\"* (Restraining Arms, Chapter Thirty-One); Wang Bi’s, *\"Chapter Thirty-One\"*; and Fan Ye’s, *\"The Fine Soldier, Chapter Thirty-One.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao is eternally nameless.\n\nThough the uncarved block be small,\nnone in the world dare claim it as a subject.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: \"Though the uncarved block be small\"—the Yu annotation reads \"beaten,\" while Wang Bi’s reads \"uncarved.\" \"None in the world dare claim it as a subject\"—Wang Bi’s reads \"none in the world can claim it as a subject.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, Yu annotation, Dunhuang, and British Library versions render \"can\" as \"dare,\" while the Jingfu version reads \"none dare,\" and all omit the character \"也.\" Qian Zhixi comments: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition omits the three characters \"Though the uncarved block be small.\" \"None in the world dare claim it as a subject\" signifies the Dao’s supremacy, for it may be named among the greatest.)*\n\nShould kings and lords hold fast to it,\nthe myriad things will of themselves submit.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: \"Should kings and lords hold fast to it\"—the Yu annotation and Heshang Gong read \"lords and kings,\" as does Liang Wu; the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include the character \"之\" after \"hold fast.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Liang Wu, Jinglong, and Dunhuang versions all read \"kings and lords.\" Lao Jian remarks: \"Should kings and lords hold fast to it\"—Fu Yi’s version and the Jinglong and Dunhuang manuscripts all read thus. Fan Ye’s version reads \"Should kings and lords hold fast to it,\" while the various Wang Bi editions read \"Should lords and kings hold fast to it.\" Other versions omit the character \"之,\" and all render \"kings and lords\" as \"lords and kings.\" The *Shiwen* states: \"Liang Wu reads 'kings and lords.'\" The characters \"lords\" and \"hold fast\" naturally harmonize within the verse’s rhyme, as in Chapter Forty-Two’s \"kings and dukes take it as their measure,\" where \"dukes\" and \"measure\" rhyme similarly—thus, it should read \"kings and lords.\" Qian Zhixi comments: \"Kings and lords\" is correct. The claim that \"dukes\" and \"measure,\" or \"lords\" and \"hold fast,\" form rhymes is unfounded.)*\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends—\nnone command it, yet it levels itself.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: \"None command it\"—Heshang Gong reads \"the people.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong and Yu annotation versions both read \"people\" as \"none.\" The Guangming and Jingfu versions include the character \"焉\" after \"levels.\" Qian Zhixi comments: The character \"none\" appears as \"people\" in the various Wang Bi editions, while the *Yongle Dadian* and Fu Yi’s version read \"none,\" as does Fan Ye’s stone inscription. The Muromachi edition includes \"焉\" after \"levels.\" Yi Shunding remarks: The Tang dynasty’s Han E’s *Suihua Jili* cites it as \"the people do not unite it, yet it levels itself\"—\"command\" is likely a corruption of \"unite.\" \"Do not unite it\" conveys the meaning of letting things take their natural course. The text states that when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends of itself; if the people do not unite it, it still levels itself—this illustrates the efficacy of non-action. Qian Zhixi comments: The *Yupian* defines \"level\" as \"even\" or \"equal.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"level their provisions\" glosses \"level\" as \"adjust.\" The *Zilin* defines \"level\" as \"field.\" Here, \"none command it, yet it levels itself\" reflects the primitive communist society of antiquity, echoing Chapter Fifty-One’s \"none command it, yet it constantly follows its nature.\" The readings \"command,\" \"unite,\" and \"enjoin\" are all plausible, though \"command\" here represents the original text.)*\n\nWhen systems begin, names arise.\nOnce names exist,\nheaven too will know when to halt.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: \"Heaven too will know when to halt\"—the Yu annotation and Wang Bi read \"then too will know when to halt,\" while Heshang Gong reads \"then too will know it.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong version reads \"heaven\" for \"then,\" omitting \"too.\" The Jingfu version reads \"heaven\" for \"then,\" including \"too.\" Qian Zhixi comments: \"Heaven\" is a scribal error. The Song-dynasty Heshang Gong edition and the Muromachi version both reflect this. Bai Yuchan notes: \"One version reads 'heaven too will know it,' and the following line matches.\" Bi Yuan remarks: \"Heshang Gong reads 'heaven too will know when to halt.'\" The error has persisted for some time. The Guangming edition’s \"then\" is partially missing, and Wu Yun mistakenly emends it to \"heaven,\" noting: \"'Heaven'—Fu Yi’s version reads 'then,' as does the Yizhou edition.\" He fails to recognize that \"heaven\" is a corruption of \"then.\" Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Ye all read \"then.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"'Then too will know when to halt'—Ma Dan and Wang Bi follow the ancient text.\" This reading should be adopted.)*\n\nKnowing when to halt averts peril.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: The Yu annotation reads \"knowing when to halt is why there is no peril,\" Heshang Gong reads \"knowing it is why there is no peril,\" and Wang Bi reads \"knowing when to halt can avert peril.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Yu annotation, Jingfu, and British Library versions include \"is why,\" while the Jinglong and Dunhuang versions omit these characters. Yu Yue remarks: The Tang dynasty’s Jinglong stele omits \"can,\" which is correct. Wang Bi’s commentary states: \"Knowing when to halt is why there is no peril.\" The addition of \"is why\" completes the sentence, but scribes mistakenly incorporated it into the main text, leading Heshang Gong to read \"knowing it is why there is no peril.\" Here, \"can\" is a corruption of \"is why.\" Qian Zhixi comments: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition reads \"is why.\" The *Juzhen* palace edition reads \"can,\" which is a corruption of \"is why.\" Yu Yue’s explanation is sound.)*\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: Heshang Gong and Wang Bi include the character \"之\" after \"Dao.\")*\n\nThe phrase \"与江海\" appears in the *Yu zhu* and Heshang Gong versions as \"之与江海,\" while Wang Bi’s version reads \"之于江海.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yu zhu*, *Jingfu*, and British Library editions all read \"之与,\" whereas the Jinglong and Dunhuang versions simply read \"与.\" Yi Shunding states: Wang Bi’s commentary says, \"like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas,\" indicating that the main text \"于江海\" should read \"与江海.\" The *Mouzi* quotes this passage as: \"The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas,\" where the character is correctly written as \"与.\" Jiang Xichang remarks: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition reads \"与\" instead of \"于,\" and this should be adopted as the correct version. These two characters were interchangeable in ancient texts, as noted in *Jingyi Shuwenn* and *Jingzhuan Shici.*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun du* reads the rhymes as follows: *ming* (名), *chen* (臣), *bin* (宾), and *jun* (均) rhyme (with *geng* and *zhen* as interchangeable rhymes); *you* (有), *zhi* (止), *dai* (殆), and *hai* (海) rhyme (in the *zhi* rhyme group). Xi Tong’s analysis aligns: *chen* (臣), *bin* (宾), and *jun* (均) rhyme, while *you* (有), *zhi* (止), *zhi* (止), *dai* (殆), and *hai* (海) rhyme. Qian Zhi notes: *Chen* (臣) and *bin* (宾) belong to the *zhen* rhyme group, *ming* (名) to the *geng* group, and *jun* (均) is shared between *zhen* and *geng*, providing evidence of *geng* and *zhen* rhyme interchange. The *Li Sao* also rhymes *ming* (名) and *jun* (均), which Xi Tong did not address. Takeuchi Yoshio’s edition reads *zhi* (之) instead of *zhi* (止), stating: \"The two instances of *ming* (名) in '无名' and '有名' rhyme, while the intervening thirty-five characters—from '朴虽小' onward—rhyme *chen* (臣) and *bin* (宾). The *zhi* (之) character forms a separate rhyme, suggesting a possible textual displacement. Compare this with the three lines beginning '名亦既有,' where *you* (有), *zhi* (之), and *dai* (殆) rhyme.\" However, Takeuchi likely did not recognize the interchangeability of *geng* and *zhen* rhymes. Wang Niansun notes: *Zhi* (止) rhymes with *you* (有), with *you* (有) pronounced similarly to *yi* (以) in the *Book of Songs* and *Chu Ci* (*Dushu Zazhi*, juan 3–4).\n\nThe Jinglong stele version does not divide this passage into chapters, comprising sixty-four characters. The Dunhuang version has sixty-five, the Heshang Gong version seventy, and the Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan versions seventy-one. The Heshang Gong edition titles this \"Sacred Virtue, Chapter Thirty-Two,\" while the Wang Bi edition titles it \"Chapter Thirty-Two,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Dao Is Eternally Nameless, Chapter Thirty-Two.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is clarity.\n*(Qian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan editions include the particle \"也\" at the end of each line. Fan Yingyuan states: \"Ancient editions included '也' at the end of each line, lending the text a measured cadence. Later editions omit these particles, but from '不失其所者久' onward, the absence of '也' leaves the phrasing incomplete. This edition follows the ancient version.\" Qian Zhi counters: Fan’s claim is incorrect. Ancient editions of the *Laozi* varied in detail, influenced by regional linguistic and cultural differences across the Northern and Southern Dynasties. As Yan Zhitui’s *Yanshi Jiaxun* (*On Literary Evidence*) observes: \"Particles such as *ye* (也), *shi* (是), *yu* (语), *yi* (已), and other grammatical markers appear in texts, but Northern traditions often omit them.\" \"Moreover, some vulgar scholars, upon encountering the occasional *ye* (也) in classical texts, arbitrarily alter them.\" Among extant editions, Southern versions tend toward elaboration, while Northern versions are more concise. The elaborate versions, such as the Fu and Fan editions—where this chapter includes *ye* (也) at the end of each line—were likely modified arbitrarily. This distinction must be recognized. Additionally, the *Hanfeizi* (*Illustrating the Laozi*) reads \"自见之谓明,\" but Wang Xianshen notes: \"'自见' in the *Laozi* is '自知.' The *Daodejing*’s '自知' follows '知人者智也,' and no edition reads '见.' This '见' is likely a scribal error, conflating the two preceding instances of '见.' It should follow the *Laozi* and read '知.'\" Qian Zhi adds: The *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Pei Songzhi’s commentary, and Yu Fan’s *Zhouyi Jijie* (under *Zhen*) all quote this line as \"自知者明,\" confirming that \"知\" is correct. The phrase \"自见之谓明\" contradicts Chapter Twenty-Four’s \"自见者不明.\")*\n\nTo overcome others is power;\nto overcome oneself is strength.\n*(Wei Jiashun notes: The *Yu zhu* includes \"者\" after \"人.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang edition writes \"强\" as \"强,\" and the same applies to \"强行\" below. Qian Zhi notes: The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan editions all include \"者\" after \"人.\" Yu Fan’s *Zhouyi Jijie* (under *Kun*) also includes \"者.\" The *Hanfeizi* (*Illustrating the Laozi*) reads \"自胜之谓强.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Preceding Oneself*) states: \"Thus, to overcome others, one must first overcome oneself; to know others, one must first know oneself.\" The *Self-Knowledge* chapter adds: \"Survival and ruin, safety and danger—do not seek them externally; focus on self-knowledge... No failure is greater than lacking self-knowledge.\" These variations all derive from the *Laozi* but alter its phrasing.)*\n\nTo be content is wealth;\nto act with resolve is purpose.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: All editions include \"者\" after \"行.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit \"者.\" Qian Zhi notes: The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (juan 34) includes \"则\" after \"行者,\" and the Muromachi edition includes \"者\" after \"行.\")*\n\nTo not lose one’s place is to endure;\nto die yet not perish is to attain longevity.\n\n*(Qian Zhi notes: All things have their proper place. The *Hanfeizi* (*Difficulties of Power*, citing Master Shen) states: “The flying dragon rides the clouds, the soaring serpent glides through the mist; when the clouds disperse and the mist clears, dragon and serpent become as worms and ants”—this speaks of losing one’s place. To not lose one’s place is like the *Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram, which says: “*Gen* means stillness. To still when it is time to still, to act when it is time to act—movement and rest do not lose their timing, and one’s Dao shines forth.” It also says: “Stillness in *Gen* is stillness in one’s proper place.” The *Mozi* (*Canon*, Part I) likewise states: “Stillness endures.” All express this principle. Yi Shunding notes: The *Yilin* reads “perish” as “delusion.” To “die yet not be deluded” means to perish rightly. Though the *Heshang Gong* edition also writes “perish,” its commentary says: “Eyes do not see delusion, ears do not hear delusion, the mouth does not speak delusion—thus one incurs no resentment under Heaven and attains longevity.” This too reads “perish” as “delusion.” Qian Zhi notes: The Muromachi old manuscript and the *Zhongdu Sizi* edition both write “delusion” for “perish.” The *Yilin* (juan 1) and *Qunshu Zhiyao* (juan 30) cite the *Daodejing* as “to die yet not be deluded is to attain longevity,” both including the *Heshang Gong* commentary, showing that the ancient edition he saw also wrote “delusion.” “Perish” and “delusion” were interchangeable in antiquity.)*\n\n*[Phonology]*\n*(This chapter’s rhymes, per Jiang Yong: “bright” and “strong” rhyme (yang group); “wealth” and “purpose” rhyme (zhi group); “endure” and “longevity” rhyme (zhi and you groups in communication, with “endure” rhyming as “nine”). Qian Zhi notes: “Endure” belongs to the zhi group, “longevity” to the you group—this is a case of zhi and you in communication. Yao Wentian and Xi Dong concur. Deng Tingzhen: “Wealth,” “purpose,” and “endure” rhyme. Karlgren and Chen Zhu: “Wealth,” “purpose,” “endure,” and “longevity” form a single rhyme. Deng Tingzhen says: “Wealth,” “purpose,” and “endure” rhyme. “Wealth” in ancient pronunciation was like *bei*. The *Shuowen* states: “Wealth means abundance.” In the *Book of Songs*, it appears five times, and in the *Yi*, three times—all rhyming with zhi and hai group words. “Endure” in ancient pronunciation was like *ji*. In the *Book of Songs*, it appears three times, and in the *Yi*, twice—all rhyming with zhi and hai group words. Below, “to die yet not perish is to attain longevity” makes “endure” rhyme with “wealth” and “purpose” above while also rhyming with “longevity” below, reflecting the gradual phonetic shifts of the late Zhou. He further notes: “Endure” in antiquity was read like *ji*. In the *Book of Songs*, “Mao Qiu” (II) rhymes with “with”; “Liu Yue” (final stanza) rhymes with “joy,” “blessing,” “friend,” “carp,” and “alas”; “Liao E” (III) rhymes with “shame” and “rely.” Characters phoneticized with “endure” include: in “Mu Gua,” “jade” and “black jade” rhyme with “plum”; in “Qiu Zhong You Ma,” “pendant” and “black jade” rhyme with “plum” and “child”; in “Cai Wei,” “great” and “grief” rhyme with “come”; in “Di Du,” “great” and “black jade” rhyme with “come”; in “Da Dong,” “heart’s grief” rhymes with “come”; in “Zhao Min,” “today’s grief” rhymes with “wealth,” “time,” and “this.” Thus, characters with the “endure” phonetic clearly belong to the zhi and hai groups. In the *Yi*, the only rhymes are in the *Jiji* hexagram commentary, where “endure” rhymes with “weary,” “doubt,” “time,” and “come,” and in the *Miscellaneous Hexagrams*, where “constant and enduring” rhymes with “moderation and stillness.” Elsewhere, the *Lin* hexagram commentary rhymes with “Dao”; the *Qian* hexagram commentary rhymes with “Dao,” “fault,” “creation,” and “head”; the *Daguo* hexagram commentary rhymes with “ugly” and “fault”; and the *Li* hexagram commentary rhymes with “fault” and “Dao”—all matching modern rhymes. As phonetic patterns shift with time, by the time Confucius commented on the *Yi*, the sounds had already slightly changed, sometimes aligning with the *Songs* and sometimes not. In the *Laozi*, “to not be endangered is to endure long,” “endure” rhymes with “endangered.” “Having the mother of the state, one can endure long,” “endure” rhymes with “mother.” Both match the *Songs*. “To be content is wealth; to act with resolve is purpose; to not lose one’s place is to endure; to die yet not perish is to attain longevity”—here, “endure” rhymes with “wealth” and “purpose,” consistent with the *Songs*, while the following phrase also rhymes with “longevity,” aligning with the *Yi*. Such pronunciations existed at the time, and no single theory can encompass them all. The *Shuowen* under “black jade” quotes the *Book of Songs*: “Bestow upon me a black jade pendant.”)*\n\nThe character 「』」 is read as *qǐ*. Some say it is read like *jū* in *jū jǐ* (the spine’s curve). The reading as *qǐ* is the ancient pronunciation; the reading as *jū* is another variant. Though *jū* belongs to the *hou* rhyme group, *you* and *hou* are phonetically close—could this be the reason?\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele edition contains thirty-eight characters in this passage, the Dunhuang edition thirty-six, the *Heshang* and Wang Bi editions thirty-eight, and the Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan editions forty-six. The *Heshang* edition titles this section \"Discerning Virtue, Thirty-Three,\" Wang Bi’s edition titles it \"Chapter Thirty-Three,\" and Fan Yingyuan’s edition titles it \"He Who Knows Others Is Wise, Chapter Thirty-Three.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe great Dao flows, it may turn left or right.\nYan Kejun notes: \"Dao flows\" (*Dao fàn*) appears as \"Dao spreads\" (*Dao fàn*) in the *Imperial Commentary* and as \"Dao flows\" (*Dao sì xī*) in the *Heshang* edition.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Shiwen* states, \"An alternate version writes *fàn*; Zhou and Zhang both follow this.\" The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, and Dunhuang editions all omit the particle *xī*.\nQian Zhian observes: The character *sì* in the stele is unclear; originally written as *fàn*, it may also appear as *sì*. The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition writes *fàn*, with the commentary also using *fàn*. The Daoist Canon’s *Collected Commentaries of Four Masters* cites Wang Bi’s commentary as *fàn*. The Fu Yi edition writes *fànfàn xī*, while the Fan Yingyuan edition writes *sìsì xī*. Writing *sì* rhymes with *yòu*, *cí*, *yǒu*, and *zhǔ*; writing *fàn* also conveys the meaning. Ma Xulun states: The characters *fàn* and *fàn* were interchangeable in ancient times. The *Liji*’s \"Wang Zhi\" chapter reads, \"*Fàn* is shared with all,\" and the *Shiwen* notes, \"*Fàn* is also written as *fàn*—this is an example.\" The *Shuowen* defines *fàn* as \"overflowing\" and *fàn* as \"floating in appearance.\" The two meanings differ, and *fàn* is the correct choice.\n\nAll things depend on it for life yet do not refuse,\nYan Kejun notes: \"For life\" (*yǐ shēng*) appears as \"and live\" (*ér shēng*) in the *Heshang* edition.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, Dunhuang, and British Library editions all write *yǐ* instead of *ér*.\nQian Zhian observes: Liu Xiaobiao’s commentary on the *Bianming Lun* also writes *yǐ shēng*, as do the *Dayian*, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan editions.\nYi Shunding states: The *Wenxuan*’s *Bianming Lun* commentary cites it as \"All things obtain it for life yet do not refuse\" and further quotes Wang Bi’s commentary: \"All things attain the Dao and live.\" Thus, the current character *shì* (\"depend\") is likely a corruption of *dé* (\"obtain\").\n\nTheir achievements are not claimed as possession.\nYan Kejun notes: \"Achievements\" (*chénggōng*) appears as \"accomplished merits\" (*gōng chéng*) in other editions. \"Not claimed as possession\" (*bù míng yǒu*) appears as \"and do not dwell\" (*ér bù jū*) in the Fu Yi and *Dayian* editions.\nQian Zhian observes: The *Guangming* edition includes the particle *ér* after *chéng*, as does the *Jingfu* edition. The *Shimochō* edition writes \"accomplished merits and do not claim possession\" (*gōng chéng ér bù míng yǒu*), while the Zhao Mengfu and Wang Xizhi editions write \"accomplished merits do not dwell\" (*gōng chéng bù jū*).\nYi Shunding states: The *Bianming Lun* commentary cites, \"Accomplished merits are not possessed; they nurture all things yet do not act as master.\" Later, it again quotes Wang Bi’s commentary, confirming this as the Wang Bi edition. Thus, the current Wang Bi edition’s \"accomplished merits are not claimed as possession\" (*gōng chéng bù míng yǒu*) should read \"accomplished merits are not possessed\" (*gōng chéng ér bù yǒu*), with *míng* being a superfluous character.\n\nIt nurtures and sustains all things yet does not act as master.\nYan Kejun notes: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in Wang Bi’s edition and as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the *Dayian* edition. \"Does not act as master\" (*bù wéi zhǔ*) in other editions includes the particle *ér* before *bù*, as does the following phrase.\nWu Yun states: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the Fu Yi edition and as \"clothes and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in Wang Bi’s edition. Bi Yuan notes that *yī* (\"clothes\") and *ài* (\"nurture\") are phonetically close—this is correct.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Heshang*, *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, British Library, *Guangming*, and *Jingfu* editions all write *ài yǎng*, while the Dunhuang edition writes *yī bèi*. The *Jinglong*, Dunhuang, and *Guangming* editions all omit the particle *ér*.\nQian Zhian observes: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the Wang Xizhi and Fan Yingyuan editions and as \"depends and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in the Suizhou edition—all convey the meaning.\nZhu Junsheng states: *Ài* is a loan for *○*. The *Shuowen* defines *○* as \"concealed from sight, from *zhú* (bamboo), phonetic *ài*.\" The *Chuci*’s \"Nine Songs\" reads, \"I dwell in deep bamboo and never see the sky.\" Bamboo excels at concealment, hence the *zhú* radical. The *Book of Songs*’ \"Jing Nü\" uses *ài* for this meaning, and the \"Zheng Min\" poem’s commentary glosses *ài* as \"hidden.\" The *Shuowen* defines *yī* (\"clothing\") as \"that which covers the body,\" also a loan for *ài*. The *Laozi* reads, \"It clothes and sustains all things yet does not act as master.\"\nFan Yingyuan states: \"Clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) aligns with Wang Bi’s and Ma Dan’s ancient editions. *Yī bèi* means \"to cover.\" The *Yi Jing*’s Han Kangbo commentary reads, \"It clothes and covers all things, thus manifesting benevolence.\" Cheng Xuanying’s *Laozi* commentary states, \"It clothes and covers all things, molding and nurturing living beings.\" The *Shuowen* defines *yī* as \"to depend.\" The *Shiming* states, \"That on which people depend to shelter from the cold.\" *Yī bèi*, *yī yǎng*, *yī yǎng*, and *ài yǎng* share the same meaning, though *ài yǎng* is particularly apt.\nLi Daochun states: \"Some interpret *ài yǎng* as *yī bèi*—this is incorrect.\"\nYu Yue states: The *Heshang Gong* edition writes *ài yǎng*, while this edition writes *yī yǎng*—an example of ancient character interchangeability. The character *yī* (\"clothing\") in ancient pronunciation was identical to *yǐn* (\"hidden\"), hence the *Baihu Tong*’s \"Yishang\" chapter states, \"Clothing means concealment\"—an example of phonetic analogy. The character *ài* in ancient pronunciation was also identical to *yǐn*, as seen in the *Book of Songs*’ \"Zheng Min\" poem, where the Mao commentary glosses *ài* as \"hidden.\"\n\nThe *Xiaojing*’s *Xun* chapter, as cited by Liu Xuan, states: \"Love is to conceal and cherish within, binding inwardly.\" It does not simply explain *xī* (\"cherish\") but insists on *\"yǐn xī\"* (\"conceal and cherish\"), also using phonetic analogy for instruction. The two characters originally shared the same pronunciation, hence *\"ài yǎng\"* could be written as *\"yī yǎng.\"*\n\nFù Yì’s edition reads *\"yī bèi\"*—this stems from later scholars failing to grasp ancient pronunciation and meaning, recklessly altering the text without foundation.\n\n*\"May be named at the Great\"*—Wei Jiǎosūn states: *\"Not to be the Master, may be named at the Great.\"* The *Yù Zhù* (Imperial Commentary) inserts before *\"kě\"* (\"may\") and after *\"zhǔ\"* (\"Master\"): *\"If ever without desire, may be named at the Small; all things return to it, yet it does not claim to be the Master\"*—fifteen characters in total. According to my examination, the *Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng* editions read *\"guī zhī\"* (\"return to it\") as *\"guī yān ér\"* (\"return to it and\"), totaling sixteen characters. Fù and Fàn’s editions read: *\"Thus, if ever without desire, may be named at the Small—Fàn’s edition reads 'for the Small'—all things return to it and yet do not know the Master\"*—seventeen characters in total. The *Dunhuang* and *Suìzhōu* editions, along with *Gù Huān’s* edition, omit the *\"cháng wú yù\"* (\"ever without desire\") trio; the rest align closely with the *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions. The *Yīnglún* and *Dunhuang* editions read *\"yān\"* as *\"zhī.\"* The *\"ér\"* (\"and\") character is absent in the *Yù Zhù* and *Dunhuang* editions. These three sentences were overlooked by Yán Kějūn.\n\nFurther examination reveals these three sentences were unlikely part of the original *Laozi* text. *\"If ever without desire, may be named at the Small\"* likely served as an ancient annotation to Chapter One’s *\"cháng wú, yù guān qí miào\"* (\"ever without, desiring to observe its subtlety\"). *Fǎyán’s* *\"Xiào zhì\"* chapter, annotated by Lǐ Guǐ, states: *\"The Dao reaches the utmost subtlety, hence it is called 'Small.'\"*\" Here, it becomes redundant. The omission of *\"cháng wú yù\"* in the *Dunhuang* and *Suìzhōu* editions confirms this. The phrase *\"may be named at the Small\"* pairs with *\"may be named at the Great,\"* yet logically, nurturing all things could be called \"Great,\" not \"Small.\" The repetition of *\"all things return to it and yet do not claim to be the Master\"* with the preceding *\"nurturing all things yet not claiming to be the Master\"* suggests redundancy, warranting deletion. This further supports the theory of interpolated ancient annotations. Cross-referencing with the *Jīnglóng* stele, which lacks these three sentences, strengthens this conclusion over other editions.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: The *Héshàng Gōng* edition reads *\"wéi dà\"* (\"for the Great\"), while the *Dàtǐan* edition reads *\"yú dà yǐ\"* (\"at the Great indeed\"), and includes *\"Thus, the Sage could accomplish its Greatness.\"* In my examination, *\"yú\"* (\"at\") and *\"wéi\"* (\"for\") shared ancient pronunciations, making *\"yú dà\"* equivalent to *\"wéi dà.\"* This *\"dà\"* corresponds to Chapter Twenty-Five’s *\"qiáng wéi zhī míng yuē dà\"* (\"forcibly naming it 'Great'\"). Fù’s edition reads *\"kě míng yú dà yǐ,\"* while Fàn’s reads *\"kě míng wéi dà yǐ\"*—both convey the same meaning. Thus, the Sage never claims to be Great, yet accomplishes its Greatness.\n\nYán Kějūn states: *\"Terminally not for the Great,\"* with the *Héshàng Gōng* edition ending the sentence with *\"yě\"* (\"indeed\"), while Wáng Bì reads *\"yǐ qí zhōng bù wéi dà\"* (\"since it terminally does not claim to be Great\"), and the *Dàtǐan* reads *\"yǐ qí bù zì dà\"* (\"since it does not exalt itself\"). Luó Zhènyù notes that the *Héshàng Gōng*, *Jīnglóng*, *Dunhuang*, *Yù Zhù*, *Jīngfú*, and *Yīnglún* editions uniformly read: *\"Thus, the Sage terminally does not claim to be Great.\"* In my examination, Wáng Xīzhī’s edition inserts *\"yě yǐ qí bù zì dà\"* (\"indeed since it does not exalt itself\") before *\"gù\"* (\"thus\") and after *\"dà\"* (\"Great\"), matching Wáng Bì’s version, while Fàn’s edition reads *\"shì yǐ shèngrén yǐ qí zhōng bù zì wéi dà\"* (\"Thus, the Sage since it terminally does not claim to be Great\"), citing *\"Yán Zhēn, Wáng Bì identical to the ancient edition.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading for this chapter: *\"yòu\"* (right), *\"cí\"* (words) rhyme (zhī department, *yòu* with variant pronunciation, *cí*, departing tone), *\"jū\"* (reside), *\"zhǔ\"* (Master) rhyme (hóu, yú interchangeable rhymes, *jū*, departing tone, *zhǔ* harmonizing with *zhū*). In my examination, *jū* belongs to the *yú* department, while *zhǔ* belongs to the *hóu* department—an example of *hóu* and *yú* interchangeable rhymes. The original *\"jū\"* was *\"yǒu\"* (have). Chén Zhù notes: *\"yòu, cí, yǒu, zhǔ\"* rhyme; *\"dà\"* (great) rhymes in triple repetition. Gāo Běn Hàn and Wǔnèi Yìyǒng note: *\"yòu, cí, yǒu\"* rhyme. Additionally, the *\"dào sì\"* edition also reads *\"fàn\"* (drift), while Fàn Yìngyuán states *\"sì\"* sounds like *\"fàn\"*—incorrect. *\"Sì\"* should sound like *\"jì\"* (record). In this chapter, *\"sì, yòu, cí, yǒu, zhǔ\"* form the rhyme, mirroring the *Chūcí’s* *\"Tiānwèn\"* where *\"sì, huì, lǐ\"* rhyme. Jiāng Yǒuguī states: *\"cí\"* is pronounced *\"zī\"* (like \"this\"). According to ancient usage, departing tones merged in *zhì* and *zhì* departments.\n\nThe *Jīnglóng* stele comprises forty-four characters, the *Dunhuang* edition fifty-five, the *Héshàng* edition sixty-two, the *Wáng* edition sixty-one, the *Fù* edition seventy-three, and the *Fàn* edition sixty-nine. The *Héshàng* edition is titled *\"Rènchéng, the Thirty-Fourth,\"* the *Wáng* edition *\"Thirty-Fourth Chapter,\"* and the *Fàn* edition *\"Dàdào Sìsì xī Chapter, the Thirty-Fourth.\"*\n\n**Thirty-Fifth Chapter**\n*\"Clutching the Great Image, the world follows.\"*\n\nIn my examination, Fù and Fàn’s editions insert *\"zhě\"* (\"that\") after *\"xiàng\"* (\"image\"). The *Yù Zhù* annotates *\"xiàng\"* as *\"○\"* (omitted). *\"Xiàng\"* is borrowed for *\"xiàng\"* (likeness), as in the *Yì Jīng’s* *\"Xìshí\"* (\"Systematic Pivot\"): *\"Seeing, it is called *xiàng*.\"* *\"Dà xiàng\"* thus means the \"Great Likeness.\" Chéng Xuānyīng’s annotation confirms: *\"The Great Image is like the law of the Great Dao.\"* Moving without harm, serene and boundless.\n\nYán Kějūn states: *\"Tài\"* (great), the *Yù Zhù* and *Dàtǐan* editions read *\"tài\"* as *\"tài\"* (great/serene). In my examination, Fù, Fàn, *Suìzhōu*, Xíng Xuán, Qìngyáng, Pánxī, Lóu Zhèngjūn’s editions read *\"tài\"* as *\"tái\"* (serene), while the *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions read *\"tài\"* (great), and the *Dàozàng Wáng* edition reads *\"dà\"* (great). *\"Tái\"* and *\"tài\"* were interchangeable in ancient usage.\n\nThe text proceeds as follows:\n\n*\"According to the old saying: ‘An’ means ‘quiet.’ The *Shìmíng* (Explanation of Names) states: ‘An, that is *yàn* (tranquil).’* Tranquil and harmonious, without fear or agitation. *Píng* (serene) is the ultimate of *ān* (tranquil), and *tài* (serene) is the ultimate of *píng* (serene). Thus, ‘*ān píng tài*’ is a parallel construction.\n\nKing Yinzhi (*Wáng Yǐnzhī*) in his *Jīngchuán Shìcí* (Exegesis of Classical Texts) disagrees, arguing: ‘*Ān* means “thus,” “therefore,” or “then.” The *Lǎozǐ* says: *“Moving without harm, serene and boundless.”* This means that only when one moves without harm does one attain *píng* and *tài* (serene).’\n\n*Lè yǔ è*, the passing guest is stopped.\nWhen the Dao speaks, it is bland and tasteless.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Dào chū yán”* (the Dao’s utterance) is recorded in the *Yù Zhù* and *Héshàng* editions as *“Dào zhī chūkǒu”* (the Dao’s utterance from its mouth), while Fù Yì’s edition reads *“Dào zhī chūyán”* (the Dao’s utterance). Below, the phrases *“shì”*, *“tīng”*, and *“yòng”* in all editions include the particle *“zhī”* (the). *“Dàn wú wèi”* (bland and tasteless) has *“hū qí”* (how its) inserted after *“dàn”* (bland) in all editions. Luó Zhènyù states that the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript reads *“yán”* (speech) for *“kǒu”* (mouth) and *“dàn”* (bland) as *“tàn”* (dim), omitting *“hū qí”*. In my examination, the *Wáng Xīshì* and *Fàn* editions also read *“yán”* for *“kǒu”*. Fàn states: *“Chūyán”* (utterance) aligns with the ancient text as per Wáng Bì’s reading. Thus, the *Wáng* edition also reads *“chūyán”*. Tōng Jīotō states: *“Dào zhī chūkǒu”* (the Dao’s utterance from its mouth) has *“kǒu”* (mouth) written as *“yán”* (speech) in ancient and stele editions. I confirm that both this annotation and the annotation of Chapter 23 use *“chūyán”*. The *Shìwén* (Explanatory Text) reads *“chǐlèi fǎn”* (rhyming with *lèi*). Examining all evidence, it is clear that the *Wáng* edition’s text reads *“chūyán”*. Those reading *“kǒu”* (mouth) likely omit the upper stroke. Hé Yàn’s annotation in the *Jǐngfú Diàn Fù* also reads *“chūyán”*. Táohóngqìng states that Fù Yì’s edition reads *“chūkǒu”* as *“chūyán”*. According to Wáng’s annotation: *“The Dao’s utterance is bland and tasteless.”* In Chapter 23, *“Xīyán zìrán”* (rarely speaking naturally), it is stated: *“The next chapter speaks of the Dao’s utterance, bland and tasteless.”* This suggests his edition aligns with Fù Yì’s. Perhaps *“yán”* (speech) was corrupted into *“kǒu”* (mouth)?\n\n*Sight is insufficient to see it; hearing is insufficient to hear it; use is insufficient to exhaust it.*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Yòng bùkě jì”* (use cannot exhaust) is recorded in the *Yù Zhù* and *Héshàng* editions as *“Yòng zhī bùkě jì”* (use cannot exhaust it), while Wáng Bì’s edition reads *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”* (use cannot fully exhaust). Wèi Jiàosūn states: *“Shì zhī bùjiàn”* (sight cannot see), with *“bù”* (not) preceded by *“zhī”* (the) in the *Yù Zhù*, and similarly below. *“Yòng bùkě jì”*—according to the *Yù Zhù*, the character *“jì”* (exhaust) is omitted. Luó Zhènyù states that the *Jǐnglóng* and *Dūnhuáng* manuscripts lack *“zhī”* (the). In my examination, the *Jǐngfú*, *Pánxī*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Shìmáchéng*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Zhào Mèngfǔ*, and *Gāoxì* editions all include *“zhī”* (the). Additionally, the *Yǒnglè Dàtǐan* *Wáng* edition reads *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”*, while other *Wáng* editions read *“bùkě”* (cannot) for *“bùzú”* (not fully). The *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Suìzhōu*, *Shìmáchéng*, and *Zhōngdū sìzǐ* editions also read *“bùkě”*, matching this stone inscription.\n\nFurther, referring to the *Shuōwén* (Explanatory Script): *“Jì”* (exhaust) means *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal), with the phonetic *“qí”* (旡). The *Yùbiǎn* (Jade Edition) under *“qí”* states: *“Jì, resident-yiè cut”*, meaning *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal) and *“yǐ”* (already). Luó Yùnxián states: *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”*—referring to the *Shuōwén*: *“Jì”* (exhaust) means *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal). The preceding text states that *lè* (music) and *è* (bait) can stop passing guests, but the Dao is different. Music can be heard, bait can be seen and eaten, yet the Dao cannot be seen, heard, or consumed. Hence: *“Sight cannot see it; hearing cannot hear it; use cannot exhaust it.”* Old annotations interpret *“jì”* as *“jìn”* (exhaust), failing to grasp ancient meanings, thus failing to rhyme properly. *(This is the sole remnant of ancient meaning.)*\n\nYáng Shùdá states: *“Lè yǔ è”* (music and bait) refers to delighting in drinking and eating. *“Lè”* (music) is pronounced *“luò”* (洛), not referring to music.\n\n**Phonology:** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading:\n- *Xiàng* (image), *wǎng* (move) – *yáng* (阳) department,\n- *Hài* (harm), *tài* (serene) – *jì* (祭) department (*hài* as *húliè fǎn*, *tài* as *tāliè fǎn*),\n- *È* (bait), *zhǐ* (stop) – *zhī* (之) department,\n- *Wèi* (taste), *jiàn* (see), *jì* (exhaust) – *zhǐ* (脂) and *yuán* (元) merged department.\n\nIn my examination: *Wèi* (taste), *jì* (exhaust) belong to the *zhǐ* (脂) department, while *jiàn* (see) belongs to the *yuán* (元) department, thus merging *zhǐ* and *yuán*. Dèng Tíngzhēn and Xí Dòng state: *Wèi* (taste), *jì* (exhaust) rhyme. Jiāng Yǒuguì states: *“È”* (bait) is pronounced *“lìngshì”* (仍吏), as ancient texts had an upper-voice tone, aligning with the *zhǐ* department. In the *Lǎozǐ Réndé* (Ren德 chapter), *“Lè yǔ è”* (music and bait) rhymes with *“zhǐ”* (stop).\n\nTo the right: The *Jǐnglóng* stele edition has 37 characters, matching the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript. The *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions have 43 characters, while the *Fù* and *Fàn* editions have 44. The *Héshàng* edition is titled *“Réndé”* (Ren德, Chapter 35), the *Wáng* edition *“Sānshíwǔ zhāng”* (Chapter 35), and the *Fàn* edition *“Zhí Dàxiàng zhāng”* (Chapter on Grasping the Great Likeness, 35).\n\n**Chapter 36:**\n*Jiāng yù xī zhī, bì gù zhāng zhī;*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Xī zhī”* (close it) is recorded in the *Héshàng* edition as *“zhī”* (it), while Wáng Bì’s edition reads *“○ zhī”* (omitted *zhī*). Jiǎnwén’s edition reads *“shì zhī”* (close it) and *“jǐ zhī”* (give it). *“Bì gù”* (must open) is recorded in all editions as *“bì gù”* (must firmly), and similarly below.\n\nIn my examination, *“xī”* (close) is correct. Both *Fù* and *Fàn* editions read *“xī”*. Fàn states: *“Xī”* means *“liǎn”* (gather), *“hé”* (unite), *“jù”* (assemble). Wáng Bì aligns with the ancient text. Thus, the *Wáng* edition also reads *“xī”*, though the current text reads *“shì”* (close).\n\nThe *Shuowen Jiezi* (Explanatory Text of Written Characters) records that the *Shuowen* edition reads *“Jiāng yù ○ zhī”*, confirming that the *Shuowen* version of the *Wang* edition had *“○”* omitted. The Dunhuang, Jingfu, and Muromachi editions all read *“”*.\n\nBì Yìn remarked: *“There were no characters ‘’ or ‘○’ in antiquity.*” The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: *“Xī (歙): to contract the nostrils.”* Since *“xī”* carries the meaning of contraction, it appropriately opposes *“zhāng”* (expand). Gù Huān followed this, deriving the sense of closure as well. *“Xī”* (翕) was less commonly used in ancient script.\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio declared: *“According to the Tianwen Chao (天文钞) and the Jinglong Stele (景龙碑), the Heshang edition reads ‘xī’ (翕). The Wang Bi edition seen by Fan Yingyuan also reads ‘xī.’ The *Hanfei zi* (韓非子) *Youlao* (喻老) chapter likewise cites it identically. It appears that both the Wang and Heshang editions originally read ‘xī,’ but later scribes altered the Wang edition to ‘○’ or ‘xī’ (歙), while the Heshang edition was changed to ‘’.*\n\n**Chapter 36 (continued):**\n*Jiāng yù ruò zhī, bì gù qiáng zhī;*\n*Jiāng yù cuì zhī, bì gù xīng zhī;*\n*Jiāng yù duó zhī, bì gù yǔ zhī.*\n*Shì wèi wēi míng.*\n\nWei Jiaosun noted: *“Bì gù”* in *“bì gù qiáng zhī”* and *“bì gù xīng zhī”* is written *“bì gù”*, while in *“bì gù yǔ zhī”* it is *“bì gù”*. Yán Kějūn stated: *“‘Bì gù’ is uniformly recorded as ‘bì gù’ in all editions below,”* which is incorrect.\n\nWu Yun remarked: *“The Heshang edition of ‘Jiāng yù ruò zhī’ reads ‘Shǐ fēi ruò zhī.’”* My examination confirms: Wu’s annotation is erroneous; the Heshang edition reads *“Jiāng shǐ ruò zhī.”* Additionally, the *Fan* and *Peng Zhi* editions of *“Jiāng yù duó zhī”* read *“Jiāng yù qǔ zhī.”*\n\nMa Xulun noted: *“The *Hanfei zi* *Youlao* chapter does not include the two lines ‘fèi zhī.’”* Both *Fan* and the *Hanfei zi* *Youlao* chapter cite *“duó”* as *“qǔ”*, and the *Shuolin* (说林) chapter’s citation of the *Zhou shu* (周书) also uses *“qǔ.”* All editions, along with the *Hou Han shu* (后汉书) *Quan Tan zhuan* (桓谭传), follow *“Jiāng yù duó zhī”* identically.\n\nJiang Xichang observed: *“The *Shiji* (史记) *Guan-Yan Liezhuan* (管晏列传) states: ‘Hence it is said: *Knowing to give as taking is the treasure of governance.*’ The *Shuoqin* (索隐) annotates: ‘The *Laozi* says: *“Jiāng yù qǔ zhī, bì gù yǔ zhī.”*’ Observing the *Shiji*’s use of *“gù yuē”* (故曰), it seems *“yǔ zhī wéi qǔ”* derives from the *Laozi* *“Jiāng yù qǔ zhī, bì gù yǔ zhī.”* Thus, the *Shiji* and *Shuoqin* both use *“qǔ.”* Jiè Yì also considers *“qǔ”* correct and advocates correcting it based on *Hanfei zi*.\n\nLáo Jiàn stated: *“‘Xīng’ (兴) should be ‘jǔ’ (举), harmonizing with the following ‘bì gù yǔ zhī.’”* *“Jiāng yù duó zhī”* is cited as *“Jiāng yù qǔ zhī”* in both *Fan* and *Hanfei zi*. *Fan*’s annotation reads: *“‘Qǔ’ is sometimes written as ‘duó,’ which is not ancient.”* Examining *“xī ruò”*, *“zhāng qiáng”*, *“cuì duó”*, *“jǔ yǔ”*—each pair forms alternating rhymes in two sentences, confirming *“duó”* is unquestionably correct.\n\nTōng Jōdō remarked: *“According to the *Wei Ce* (魏策), Ren Zhang said: ‘The *Zhou shu* (周书) states: *“Jiāng yù bài zhī, bì gǔ fú zhī; Jiāng yù qǔ zhī, bì gǔ yǔ zhī.”*’ The annotation by Wang Yingluan reads: *“Does the *Zhou shu* here refer to Su Qin’s *Zhou shu Yinfu* (周书阴符)? Perhaps the *Laozi*’s words originated from this.”* Zhuzi stated: *“The *Laozi* served as the *Zhùxià Shǐ* (柱下史), hence he saw this text.”* The *Hanfei zi* *Shuolin* chapter’s citation of the *Zhou shu* aligns with the *Guoce*.\n\nMy examination: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (吕氏春秋) *Xínglùn* (行论) chapter states:\n*“Shī yuē: ‘Jiāng yù huǐ zhī, bì zhòng lěi zhī; Jiāng yù bì zhī, bì gāo jǔ zhī.’”*\nThis shares a similar structure but differs in meaning, likely also originating from the *Laozi*.\n\nRegarding *“Shì wèi wēi míng”*, Gāo Yándì remarked: *“The first eight lines describe the subtle interplay of calamity and fortune, prosperity and decline—natural operations of Heaven and Earth, seemingly obscure yet manifest. ‘Wēi míng’ means subtly luminous.”*\n\n**Róu shèng gāng, ruò shèng qiáng.**\n\nYán Kějūn noted: *“This aligns with the *Dàdiǎn* (大典).”* The *Yùzhù* (御注), *Heshang*, and *Wang Bi* editions read *“róu ruò shèng gāng qiáng”*, while *Fù Yì* (傅奕) reads *“róu zhī shèng gāng, ruò zhī shèng qiáng.”* My examination confirms: The *Wang Xīshì* (王羲之) edition, *Peng Zhi* edition, *Fan* edition, and *Fù* edition all follow *“róu zhī shèng gāng, ruò zhī shèng qiáng.”* The *Qīshíbā zhāng* (七十八章) stele reads *“ruò shèng qiáng, róu shèng gāng,”* reversing the order of the text. The *Wang* edition reads *“ruò zhī shèng qiáng, róu zhī shèng gāng,”* while the *Fù* edition reads *“róu zhī shèng gāng, ruò zhī shèng qiáng,”* each dividing into two sentences.\n\nLǐ Dàochún stated: *“‘Róu ruò shèng gāng qiáng’ should not be split into two sentences.”*\n\n**Yú bùkě tuō yú yuān,**\n\n**Qián Zhī’àn:** The *Fù* and *Fàn* editions read *“tuō”* as *“tú”*. Bì Yàn remarked: *“Heshang Gong and Wang Bi both read ‘tuō.’ There was no ancient character ‘tú’—‘tuō’ is correct. The *Zhuangzi* and *Shuoyuan* both read ‘tuō.’”*\n\nJiǎng Xīchāng noted: *“In the *Hou Han Shu*’s *Huì Ráo Gōngsūn Shù* transmission, it states: ‘Yào zhī, yú bùkě tuō yú yuān.’ The citation matches this text.”* Only the commentary reads: *“Lǎozǐ says: ‘Yú bùkě tuō yú quán.’ Tuō means ‘lost’—lost from the spring, it will dry up.”* It also cites the *Zhái Fù* transmission, where *“yuān”* is written as *“quán.”* Thus, ancient editions sometimes read *“quán”* instead of *“yuān.”*\n\n**Qián Zhī’àn:** *“Quán”* is incorrect. In this chapter, *“yuān”* and *“rén”* rhyme—it should read *“yuān.”* The character *“quán”* was a Tang-dynasty alteration to avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozu’s name, changing *“yuān”* to *“quán.”* Hàn Fēi’s *“Yù Lǎo”* passage reads: *“Gùyuē, ‘yú bùkě tuō yú shēn yuān.’”* Wáng Xiānshèn commented: *“Shēn is a redundant character. The Tang altered ‘yuān’ to ‘shēn’; later scholars reverted it, also changing ‘shēn’ back.”* I note: Tang-era taboo alterations often changed *“yuān”* to *“shēn,”* but *“yuān”* could also be altered to *“quán.”* Only *“yuān”* is the original.\n\n**Guó yǒu lìqì, bùkě shì rén.**\nYán Kějūn remarked: *“Guó yǒu,”* other editions read *“guó zhī.”* *“Kě shì,”* other editions read *“kěyǐ shì.”*\n\n**Qián Zhī’àn:** Hàn Fēi’s *“Yù Lǎo”* cites *“bāng zhī lìqì,”* while the *“Liù Wéi” Shǒu Tǔ* chapter cites *“guó,”* confirming *“guó”* is correct. The *Zhuangzi* *“Qìqiè”*, *Huáinán* *“Dào Yīng”*, *Xúnzǐ* *“Zhèng Míng”* (with Yáng Shè’s annotation), *Huáinán* *“Zhǔshù”* (with Gāo Yù’s annotation), *Wén Xuǎn* *“Guānmén Shī”* (with Lǐ Shàn’s annotation), *Hou Han Shu* *“Zhái Fù”*, and *“Dù Dú”* transmissions all cite *“guó.”* The *Shuōyuàn* *“Jūn Dào”* further cites *“guó zhī lìqì, bùkě jiè rén.”* Based on this, *“guó”* is correct, not *“bāng.”* Wáng Xiānshèn and Liú Shīpéi argued that *“guó”* was a taboo alteration of *“bāng,”* which may apply elsewhere, but not universally here.\n\nThe *Shuōyuàn* *“Jūn Dào”* also reads *“bùkě jiè rén,”* matching the *“Liù Wéi” Shǒu Tǔ*: *“Wú jiè rén lìqì, jiè rén lìqì zé wéi rén suǒ hài, ér bù zhōng qí shì.”* Both use *“jiè.”* The *Huáinán* *“Zhǔshù”* cites: *“Yǒu yú zhì zhě, bùkě yǔ lìqì,”* with Gāo Yù’s annotation quoting Lǎozǐ: *“Guó zhī lìqì, bùkě jià rén.”* *“Jià”* also means *“jiè,”* suggesting the ancient text may have originally read *“jiè.”*\n\n---\n**[Yīnyùn]**\nJiāng Shì’s rhyme reading: *“míng, gāng, qiáng”* (Yáng department), *“yuān, rén”* (Zhēn department).\n*“Jiāng yù xī zhī”* to *“jǔ yǔ”*—eight lines without rhyme—is incorrect.\nDèng Tíngzhēn and Yáo Wéntián: *“zhāng, qiáng”* rhyme.\nXí Dòng: *“zhāng, qiáng, xīng”* with *“míng”* rhyme; *“gāng, qiáng”* rhyme.\nChén Zhù: *“zhāng, qiáng, xīng”* with *“míng, qiáng”* rhyme.\nGāo Běnhàn: *“xī, ruò, fèi, qǔ, yǔ”* interspersed with *“zhāng, qiáng, xīng”* for rhyme.\n*“Qǔ,”* the stele reads *“duó.”*\nLáo Jiàn remarked: *“Xī-ruò, zhāng-qiáng, fèi-duó, jǔ-yǔ*—two lines alternating for rhyme—should read *“duó.”* Correct.\n\nSome say *“xī, ruò”* are not rhymes.\n**Qián Zhī’àn:** *“Xī,”* the *Shìwén* notes: *“Jiǎnwén”* reads *“xī,”* Heshang reads *“xī”* (with *“xū”* pronunciation). *“Míng, gāng, qiáng”* may also rhyme as *“míng, qiáng.”*\nGǔ Yánwú remarked: *“Míng,”* in ancient pronunciation *“móuláng”* (modern phonetic reconstruction suggests *“míláng”*). *“Míng”* and *“qiáng”* rhyme. Supporting evidence: *“Zhōngyōng”* states: *“Guǒ néng cǐ dào, suī róu bì qiáng.”*\nAgain: *“Ròu,”* anciently read like *“rú”*. The *Shuōwén*’s *“○, 鍒”* both define *“rú”* (soft), and Emperor Táiwǔ of Wei altered *“Róurán”* to *“Shuóshuó,”* proving *“ròu”* was pronounced like *“rú.”*\nAgain: *“Yuān, rén”* rhyme.\n\nAll scholars concur.\n\nJiāng Yǒng remarked: *“Yuān,”* pronounced *“jūn”* (均切). Supporting evidence: *“Lǎozǐ”* states: *“Fish cannot be detached from the depths (yuān), the state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to the people.”* The primary proof: *“Shī”* *“Its heart is sealed deep”* rhymes with *“shēn, rén,”* *“Holding its heart sealed deep”* rhymes with *“líng, rén, tián, qiān.”*\n\nDèng Tíngzhēn remarked: *“Yuān,”* in ancient pronunciation, belonged to the *Zhēn-Xiān* rhyme group. In the *“Yì” (易) Dry Nine-Fourth*: *“Or leaping into the depths”* rhymes with *“Lì jiàn dàrén”* (Nine-Fifth). In *“Shī” Yàn Yàn*: *“Its heart is sealed deep”* rhymes with *“Guǎ rén,”* and in *“Dìng zhī fāngzhōng”*: *“Holding its heart sealed deep”* rhymes with the two *“rén”* characters.\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* stele version contains **53 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng Dīng* manuscript is incomplete, with unclear character count. The *Héshàng* and *Wáng* versions have **56 characters**, the *Fù* version **57**, and the *Fàn* version **59**. The *Héshàng* version is titled *“Wēimíng, Chapter 36”*, the *Wáng* version *“Chapter 36”*, and the *Fàn* version *“Jiāngyù xī zhī zhāng, Chapter 36.”*\n\n**Chapter 37**\nThe Dao ever acts without action yet accomplishes all.\nIf lords and kings can preserve it, all things will transform of themselves.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Néng shǒu”*—Wáng Bì’s text may include *“zhī”* after *“shǒu.”*\nQián Zhī’àn observes: The *Fù* and *Fàn* versions read *“Hóuwáng”* as *“Wánghóu,”* while the *Jǐngfú* version reads *“ruò”* as *“ér.”*\nThe *“zhī”* character appears in *Jǐnglóng*, *Yùzhù*, *Yīnglún*, and *Fùyì* versions but is absent in *Fàn* and *Shìmachi* versions.\n\n*“Wúwéi ér wúbùwéi”* aligns with *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *“Tiānxìa Pían”* description of Guān Yīn and Lǎo Dān’s Dao:\n*“In itself, it takes no form, yet shapes all things. Its motion is like water, its stillness like a mirror, its response like an echo.”*\nIt acts without action, yet nothing remains undone.\n\nAgain, *Ruǎn Jié’s* *“Tōng Lǎo Lùn”* states:\n*“The Dao follows spontaneity to transform. If lords and kings preserve it, all things will transform of themselves.\nThe *Yì* calls it the *Tàijí*, the *Chūnqiū* calls it *Yuán*, and *Lǎozǐ* calls it the Dao.”*\n\nWhen transformation seeks to arise, I shall govern it with the nameless *pǔ*.\nYán Kějūn notes: The *Yùzhù* and *Wáng Bì* versions read *“zhī pǔ.”*\nQián Zhī’àn observes: The *Fù* and *Fàn* versions also read *“pǔ.”*\nBì Yàn remarks: *“Pǔ”* originally read *“pǔ”* (same character). *“Huà ér yù zuò,”* *“zuò”* opposes *“wú.”*\nThe *“Ěryǎ”* *“Shìyán”* states: *“Zuò,”* meaning *“to do.”* It also means *“to change.”*\nThe *“Lǐjì” Āigōng Wèn* *“zuò sè ér duì”* is annotated: *“To change.”*\n*“Huà ér yù zuò”* thus means *“to transform and seek change.”*\n*“Pǔ,”* per the *Shuōwén*: *“Uncarved wood.”*\nThe *“Shū” Zǐcái* *“jì qín pǔ zhuó”* is annotated by Má: *“Unfinished material.”*\nThe *“Lùnzhēng” Liángzhī Pían* states: *“That which has not been cut by knife or axe is called *pǔ.*”*\n\nThe nameless *pǔ* will also not desire.\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Yì jiāng bù yù,”* *Wáng Bì* reads *“Fú yì jiāng wú yù.”*\nLuó Zhèn’yù remarks: *“Wúmíng zhī pǔ,”* according to the *Shìwén*, the *Wáng* version seems to lack this sentence. *“Fú yì jiāng wú yù,”* the *Shìwén* notes *“wú”* as *“jiǎnwén”* reads *“bù.”* The *Jǐnglóng*, *Yùzhù*, *Jǐngfú*, and *Yīnglún* versions lack the *“fú”* character, and *“wú”* is also written as *“bù.”*\nYú Shěngwú states: Examining *Lǎozǐ*, the *“fú”* character was often added by later scholars. *“Wú”* written as *“bù”* is evidence of this.\n\nThe *Héshànggōng* version correctly reads *“yì jiāng bù yù, bù yù yǐ jìng.”*\nBy comparing with ancient texts’ repeated characters, *“yì jiāng bù yù, bù yù yǐ jìng”* should originally read *“yì jiāng bù = yù = yǐ jìng,”* confirming *“wú”* should be *“bù.”*\n\nWithout desire, it remains still—\nthe world will then rectify itself.\nQián Zhī’àn notes: All versions include *“jiāng,”* except the *Suìzhōu* version. *“Zhèng,”* the *Zhūwáng* versions and *Sòngkān Héshàng* read *“dìng,”* while *Wáng Xīzhī*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Gāoxì*, and all stone versions read *“zhèng.”*\n*“Zhèng”* and *“dìng”* share meaning; *“dìng”* derives from *“zhèng”* phonetically and resembles it in form.\nLáo Jiàn cites the *Shuōwén* ancient *“zhèng”* as ○, and Xià Jùn’s *“Gǔwén Yuàn”* *“dìng”* character, referencing Hàn Jiǎn’s seal script as ○.\n\n**Phonology:**\nJiāng Shì’s rhyme reading for this chapter:\n*“Wéi, wéi, huà”* (Gē department, *“wéi”* as *“é,”* *“huà”* as *“hē”*), *“pǔ, pǔ, yù”* (Hóu department), *“jìng, zhèng”* (Gēng department).\nXí Dòng: *“Wéi, huà”* rhyme, *“zuò, pǔ, pǔ, yù”* rhyme, *“jìng, dìng”* rhyme—evidence of *“zhèng”* as *“dìng.”*\nGāo Běn Hàn agrees, collecting both *“zhèng”* and *“dìng.”*\nDèng Tíngzhēn concurs, except omitting *“zuò,”* stating: *“Zhèng,”* one version reads *“dìng,”* *“jìng, dìng”* also rhyme.\n\nQián Zhī’àn notes: In **Chapter 57**, *“Wǒ wúwéi ér mín zìhuà,”* *“wéi, huà”* also rhyme.\n*Zhuāngzǐ’s* *“Dàzōngshī”*: *“Magnificent, O Transformation!

This establishes the precedent.\n\n「Gu Yánwú states: *“Pǔ,”* in ancient times, was pronounced as *pǔmù* (普木反).\n**Laozi’s** *“Dàodéjīng”*:\n*“○ xiāo, qí ruò pǔ; kuàng xiāo, qí ruò gǔ; hún xiāo, qí ruò

transformation occurs and desire arises,\nI shall govern it with the nameless simplicity;\nthe nameless simplicity, too, will not desire.\nI have no desire, and the people will return to simplicity of themselves.”*\n(According to the *Tángyùn Zhèngshēng* rhyme: *zhèng* as *dìng* in the third rhyme.)\n\nJiāng Yǒuguǎng states: *“Jìng,”* pronounced *jìyǐng* (疾郢切).\nIn ancient times, only the *píng* (level) and *qù* (descending) tones existed;\nit was only from the *Wèi* and *Jìn* dynasties onward that the *shǎng* (rising) tone was introduced,\nand it should be collected alongside the *qīng* (clear) and *jìng* (vigorous) rhyme groups.\nIn **Laozi’s** *“Wéizhèng” (For Polity)*: *“bù yù yǐ jìng”* (不欲以静) rhymes with *zhèng*;\nin *“Hóngdé” (On Virtue)*: *“qīngjìng”* (清静) rhymes with *zhèng*;\nin *“Chúnfēng” (Pure Wind)*: *“wǒ hào jìng”* (我好静) rhymes with *zhèng*;\n*“guī gēn yuē jìng”* (归根曰静) rhymes with *mìng* (命).\nAll above instances are in the *qù* tone (as per *Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng* forty *jìng*).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* stele text has **48 characters** in its thirty-eighth chapter;\nthe *Yīnglún* and *Héshàng* editions match this, while the *Fù* edition has **49 characters**,\nand the *Wáng* and *Fàn* editions have **50 characters**.\nThe *Héshàng* edition is titled *“Wéizhèng Dìsānshīqī” (For Polity, the Thirty-Seventh)*,\nthe *Wáng* edition *“Sānshīqīzhāng” (Thirty-Seventh Chapter)*,\nand the *Fàn* edition *“Dàocháng Wúwéi Zhāng Dìsānshī” (Chapter on the Dao’s Constant Non-Action, Thirty-Seventh)*.\nThe *Jǐnglóng* stele’s original text leaves **six blank

(obtain).\nThe Dao generates all things,\nwith some obtaining and some gaining—\nthus it is called the *Déjīng* (Virtue/Power Classic),\ncomprising **44 chapters**.\nOne edition has **43 chapters**.\n\nYán Kějūn states: **Laozi’s** *Déjīng*,\nthe *Yùzhù* (Imperial Commentary) and *Héshàng* editions title it *“Lǎozǐ Déjīng Juànxià” (Laozi’s Virtue/Power Classic, Volume Below)*,\nwhile *Wáng Bì* titles it *“Lǎozǐ Déjīng Xiàpiān” (Laozi’s Virtue/Power Classic, Lower Section)*.\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Chapter**:\n*“Shàngdé bù dé, shì yǐ yǒu dé.\nXiàdé bù shī dé, shì yǐ wú dé.”*\n*“Shàngdé wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi,\nxiàdé □□ ér yǒu yǐwéi.”*\n**Qián Zhī’àn’s annotation**:\nThe final two characters of the stele’s text *“xiàdé □□ ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (下德□□而有以为) were originally blank,\nfilled according to other editions—likely *“wéizhī”* (为之), but mistaken.\nThe correct reading should be *“xiàdé wúwéi ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (下德无为而有以为), adding *“wúwéi”* (无为).\n*“Shàngdé bù dé, shì yǐ yǒu dé”* (上德不德，是以有德)\nmatches the *Tàisū* (Inner Canon) *Shùnyǎng* (Nourishing Life) annotation in *Tàisū Juàn’èr* (Volume Two)\nand the *Zhōuyǐ Jìjiě* (Collected Commentaries on the *Yìjīng*) by *Gān Jiǔjiā* (干九家),\nboth citing the same two lines.\n\nThe *Shǐjì* (Records of the Grand Historian) *Kùlì* (Cruel Ministers) transmits the first four lines identically.\nThe *“Wénxuǎn” (Literary Selection)*** *Wèidū* (Capital of Wei) annotation cites *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi”* (上德无为而无不为),\nmatching the *Fù* and *Fàn* editions.\n\n**Fàn Yìngyuán** states:\n*“Shàngdé wúwéi”* (上德无为) and the following two lines,\n*Han Feizi*, *Wáng* (王○), *Wáng Bì*, *Guōyún*, and *Fù Yì* all agree with the ancient edition,\nwhile *Héshàng Gōng* reads *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi, xiàdé wéizhī ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (上德无为而无以为，下德为之而有以为).\nNow we follow the ancient edition.\n\n**Yú Yì** states:\n*“Wú”* (无), in the *Han Feizi* *“Jiě Lǎo” (Explanation of Laozi)*,\nis written as *“wú bùwéi”* (无不为).\nThis likely reflects the ancient edition of *Laozi*,\nwhereas the current reading *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) is a mistake influenced by the *“shàngrén”* (上仁) line below.\nThe *Fù Yì* edition correctly reads *“bù”* (不).\n\n**Qián Zhī’àn’s annotation**:\nThe stele reads *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为), which is correct.\nAll agree that *Jiāng Yǒuguǎng*’s *Lǎozǐ Jiějiě* (Explanations of Laozi) states:\n*“One edition reads: ‘上德无为而无不为，下德为之而无以为’ (Shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi, xiàdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi),\nlikely following the *Chǔ* (褚) edition.”*\nThe *Chǔ* edition refers to the *Dàodéjīng* calligraphied by *Jìn* *Wáng Yòujūn* (王右军),\nwith a *Chǔ Suìliáng* (褚遂良) postscript from *Zhēnguān* 15 (贞观十五年).\nThus, it is known that *Wáng Xīzhī*’s (王羲之) edition aligns with the *Fù* edition’s correctness.\nHowever, *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi”* (上德无为而无以为) is superior in meaning\nto *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi”* (上德无为而无不为).\nThe *Tàishàng* (Most High) knows what exists,\nthus does nothing and yet achieves completion—\nas in **Chapter 57**: *“wǒ wúwéi ér mín zìhuà”* (我无为而民自化).\n*“Wúwéi”* (无为) and *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) seem indistinguishable,\nyet *“wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi”* (无为而无以为) and *“wúwéi ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (无为而有以为) differ greatly.\nThe *Fù* and *Fàn* editions’ *“xiàdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (下德为之而无以为)\ncompared to the stele’s *“xiàdé wúwéi ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (下德无为而有以为),\nthe *Fù* and *Fàn* editions’ *“xiàdé”* (下德) aligns with *“shàngrén”* (上仁),\nand *“xiàdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (下德为之而无以为) is identical to *“shàngrén wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (上仁为之而无以为).\nIs this logically sound?\n\n**Bì Qián** states:\n*“Wú”* (无) is written as *“yǒu”* (有) in the *Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng Bì* editions.\nThis should be *“yǒu”*, or the *Fù* edition’s transmission and carving may be erroneous.\nBì’s view is correct.\nMoreover, *“shàngdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (上德为之而无以为),\n**Fàn Yún** states: *“Hán Fēizǐ* (韩非子) matches the ancient edition.”\nNow, *Han Feizi* lacks this sentence,\nand since *Han Feizi* does not have it,\nthe original text certainly does not either.\n**Mǎ Qíchǎng** states:\n*“Wéizhī”* (为之) was originally misread as *“wúwéi”* (无为),\nmistakenly aligning with the *“shàngyì”* (上义) line.\nThe *Fù* edition further misread it as *“shàngrén”* (上仁),\nand commentators force interpretations—\nall incorrect.\nNow we correct it.»\n\n「Virtue has its gradations above and below, yet its essence as *Wuwei* is singular. Though it does not lose its virtue, within the realm of *Wuwei*, there remains still a means of action. **Qian Zhi** notes: Mǎ’s reasoning is correct.\n\nChapter sixty-three states: *“Wuwei is done.”* It means *Wuwei* yet there is still a means of action. *“Shàngrén wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (上仁为之而无以为), *“shàngyì wéizhī ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (上义为之而有以为). **Qian Zhi** notes: The preceding text takes *“wúwéi”* (无为) as its core, distinguishing *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) and *“yǒu yǐwéi”* (有以为); *Shàngdé* (上德) has *“wú yǐwéi”*, while *Xiàdé* (下德) has *“yǒu yǐwéi”*. This passage takes *“wéizhī”* (为之) as its core, distinguishing *“wú yǐwéi”* and *“yǒu yǐwéi”*; *Shàngrén* (上仁) has *“wú yǐwéi”*, while *Shàngyì* (上义) has *“yǒu yǐwéi”*.\n\nThe *Fàn* edition aligns with this, but the *Fù* edition changes *“shàngyì”* (上义) to *“xiàyì”* (下义), which is incorrect. *“Shànglǐ wéizhī ér mò zhī yìng”* (上礼为之而莫之应), then *“rǎng bì ér céng zhī”* (则攘臂而仍之). **Bì Qián** states: *“Céng”* (仍), the *Wáng Bì* edition renders as *“rēng”* (扔). **Qian Zhi** notes: The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *“céng”* (仍) as *“to follow or persist”*. *“Rēng”* (扔) also means *“to persist”* or *“to follow”*, as seen in the *“Rēng Shì”* (扔氏) of the *Xià Shí* (夏时). **Qian Zhi** notes: The editions from *Yùzhù* (御注), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), and *Lóuzhèng* (楼正) stone texts, as well as the copies by *Yán Zūn* (严遵), *Fù Yì* (傅奕), *Nài Juàn* (柰卷), *Shìtáng* (室町), *Gù* (顾), and *Péng* (彭), all render *“céng”* (仍). The *Fàn* edition renders *“rēng”* (扔), which is correct. The *Guǎng Yǎ* (广雅) states: *“Rēng”* (扔) means *“to pull or drag”*, and the *Guǎng Yùn* (广韵) defines it as *“to forcefully pull or drag”*. *“Rēng”* (扔) and *“céng”* (仍) share the same pronunciation and meaning, but *“rēng”* (扔) carries the radical *“shǒu”* (手, hand), aligning better with *“rǎng bì”* (攘臂, roll up one’s sleeves).\n\n**Fàn** states: *“Rǎng bì”* (攘臂)—to roll up one’s sleeves and step forward—is *“rǎng”* (攘). *“Rēng”* (扔) is the same as the *Wáng Bì* edition and the ancient texts; the world’s editions render *“céng”* (仍). Now we follow the ancient texts.\n\nThus, one loses the *Dao* and then falls to virtue, loses virtue and then falls to *rén* (仁, benevolence), loses benevolence and then falls to *yì* (义, righteousness), loses righteousness and then falls to *lǐ* (礼, propriety). **Liú Shīpéi** states: The *Hán Fēizǐ* (韩非子) commentary on *Lǎozǐ* (老子) reads: *“Thus it is said: ‘One loses the *Dao* and then falls to losing virtue, loses virtue and then falls to losing benevolence, loses benevolence and then falls to losing righteousness, loses righteousness and then falls to losing propriety.’”* Observing this text, the *Wáng* (王) and *Héshàng* (河上) editions have omitted the four *“shī”* (失, lose) characters.\n\n**Mǎ Xùlún** states: The *Hòuhànshū* (后汉书) commentary on *Cuī Jǐng* (崔骃) omits these four characters, while the commentary on *Zhū Mù* (朱穆) includes them. The *“Fǔxíng Jì”* (辅行记) in its third volume cites even more: *“失礼而后智，失智而后信”* (失义而后失礼, lose propriety and then falls to wisdom; lose wisdom and then falls to trustworthiness), but all editions and the *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) *“Zhīběi Yóu”* (知北游) chapter’s citation match this passage. The *“jiān yì”* (譣义, variant reading) is also inappropriate, as these two additional sentences and the four *“shī”* (失) characters do not fit.\n\n**“Lǐ”** (礼, propriety), as the thin veneer of *zhōngxīn* (忠信, loyalty and trustworthiness), is the origin of disorder. **Yán Kějūn** states: *“Zhōngxīn zhī bó”* (忠信之薄, the thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness), the *Yùzhù* (御注) renders as *“zhī bù”* (之簿). The same applies to *“bù chǔ qí bó”* (不处其薄, not dwelling in its thinness). **Luó Zhènyù** states: *“Shǒu”* (首, origin), the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition adds *“yě”* (也, also).\n\n**Qian Zhi** notes: The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions, as well as the *Shìtáng* (室町) edition, also include *“yě”* (也). **Lǐ Qiào** states: The *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) *“Zhīběi Yóu”* (知北游) chapter’s citation reads *“Lǐ zhě, dào zhī huà ér luàn zhī shǒu yě”* (礼者，道之华而乱之首也, propriety is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of disorder), mistakenly merging the two sentences into one.\n\n**Sòng Xiángfèng** states: The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) wrote this to elucidate the natural governance of the *Huángdì* (黄帝, Yellow Emperor), akin to the *“Lǐyùn”* (礼运) passage *“Dàdào zhī xíng”* (大道之行, the great *Dao* in action). Thus, it prioritizes *dào* (道, *Dao*/Way) and *dé* (德, virtue/power), followed by *rén* (仁, benevolence) and *yì* (义, righteousness). *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius) established the *Liùjīng* (六经, Six Classics), expounding upon the *Dao* of *Yǔ* (禹, Yu), *Tāng* (汤, Tang), *Wén* (文, King Wen), *Wǔ* (武, King Wu), and *Zhōugōng* (周公, Duke Zhou), akin to the *“Lǐyùn”* passage *“Dàdào jì yǐn, tiānxià wéi jiā”* (大道既隐，天下为家, the great *Dao* having hidden, the world becomes a family). Thus, the middle part clarifies *rén* (仁), *yì* (义), *lǐ* (礼), and *zhī* (知, wisdom), to rescue this age.\n\nHence, the teachings of *Huáng* (黄, Yellow) and *Lǎo* (老, *Lǎozǐ*) complement those of *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius). Moreover, he states: *“Lǐ zhě, zhōngxīn zhī bó ér luàn zhī shǒu yě”* (礼者，忠信之薄而乱之首也, propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness and the origin of disorder), indicating that as social customs decay, the *Dao*, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness descend in order, and propriety becomes the means of governing the people. *Luàn* (乱) here means *treatment* or *regulation*. The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) spoke of *lǐ* (礼, propriety), hence *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius) inquired about it.\n\n**Qian Zhi** notes: Sòng’s argument is well-reasoned, yet it fails to clarify the source of the teachings, interpreting *“luàn”* (乱) as *“treatment”* or *“regulation”*. Referencing the *Lǐjì* (礼记) *“Lǐyùn”* (礼运) Chapter sixty-four *“Zhì zhī yú wèi luàn”* (治之于未乱, govern before disorder arises), *“zhì”* (治) and *“luàn”* (乱) are paired terms, so *“luàn”* (乱) here should not be interpreted alone as *“treatment”*.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) knew that *lǐ* (礼, propriety) was a superficial adornment of the *Dao* and the beginning of folly, thus he said: *“Chǔ qí hòu, bù chǔ qí bó”* (处其厚，不处其薄, dwell in its thickness, not in its thinness). *“Qiánzhì zhě, dào zhī huà ér yú zhī shǐ”* (前识者，道之华，而愚之始, wisdom is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly). **Qian Zhi** notes: The *Hán Fēizǐ* (韩非子) commentary on *Lǎozǐ* (老子) reads *“Qiánzhì zhě, dào zhī huà yě, ér yú zhī shǒu yě”* (前识者，道之华也，而愚之首也, wisdom is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly).\n\nThe characters *“qiánzhì”* (前识) are rendered *“qiánzhí”* (前职) by *Yán Zūn* (严遵), with the annotation *“preparatory and orderly”*. Based on the annotation, *“zhí”* (职) is a miswritten character. *“Yú zhī shǐ”* (愚之始, the origin of folly), the *Fù* (傅) edition changes *“shǐ”* (始) to *“shǒu”* (首), and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) annotates *“dào zhī huà ér yú zhī shǒu”* (道之华而愚之首, the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly), indicating that the *Wáng* (王) edition also renders *“shǒu”* (首). The *Fàn* (范) and *Nài Juàn* (柰卷) editions render *“shǐ”* (始).\n\nThe *“Lǐjì”* (礼记) *“Qū Lǐ”* (曲礼) *“Zhèngyì”* (正义) annotation cites: *“Lǐ zhě, zhōngxīn zhī bó, dào dé zhī huà, zhēng yú zhī shǐ”* (礼者忠信之薄，道德之华，争愚之始, propriety is the thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness, the adornment of virtue and *Dao*, and the beginning of folly in contention). **Yì Shùndǐng** states: The cited text has *“dào”* (道) followed by *“dé”* (德), and *“zhēng”* (争) before *“yú”* (愚). I propose *“yú”* (愚) should be *“yù”* (遇, encounter), as in *“Shuō Pángēng”* (盘庚) *“zàn yù jiānmiè”* (暂遇奸宄, temporarily encountering deceitful and wicked people) and *“Huáinán”* (淮南) *“ǒu yù zhìgù”* (偶○智故, occasionally encountering wisdom). The *“Lǚshì Chūnqiū”* (吕氏春秋) *“Wùgōng”* (勿躬) passage *“yōuxuì yúxiǎn zhī yán”* (幽诡愚险之言, obscure, deceptive, foolish, and treacherous words), *Wángshì Jīngyì Shùwén* (王氏经义述闻) interprets *“yú”* (愚) as *“yù”* (遇).\n\n「愚」 and 「遇」 were interchangeable in ancient usage—this text follows that tradition as well. **The beginning of foolishness is the beginning of deceit.** Thus, the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in adornment; he rests in reality, not in superficiality. Therefore, he rejects the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: The *Héshàng* text reads, *“dwell in substance, not in superficiality; rest in reality, not in adornment.”* **Wáng Bì** concurs. **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Héshàng* manuscripts vary—some render both latter clauses with *“reside”* (居), while the *Shitōchō*, *Fù*, and *Fàn* versions use *“dwell”* (处) in all four clauses. **Sūn Shèng’s** *Old and New Doubts on Laozi* also follows this pattern. **Fàn Yìngyuán** states: *“Hán Fēi* and *Yán Zhūn* align with the ancient text, though one variant renders the latter clauses with *“reside”* (居).* **Bì Yàn** remarks: *Wáng Fú’s* *Hidden Talents* reads *“not reside in superficiality,”* matching *Wáng Bì’s* version. **Zhū Mù’s** *Exalting Thickness* cites the first two clauses with *“dwell”* (处) and the latter two with *“reside”* (居).\n\nFurthermore, *“therefore, he rejects the latter and embraces the former”*—**Yán Zhūn’s** text omits *“therefore”* (故). The *Huáinán* *Dàoyìng* commentary cites this sentence identically.\n\n---\n**[Phonology & Rhyme]**\nThis chapter lacks rhyme in *Jiāng Shì’s* readings. **Xí Dòng** notes: *“Chief/beginning”* (首/始) and *“thin/adornment”* (薄/华) form rhymes. **Lǐ Qióngyún** confirms: *“Thin”* (薄) and *“adornment”* (华) rhyme, as do *“chief”* (首) and *“beginning”* (始). In ancient pronunciation, *“adornment”* (华) was pronounced like *“spread”* (敷). The *Gōngyáng* *Āi* *Sìnián* records *“Púshè zāi”* (蒲社灾), while *Gǔliáng* and *Zuǒshì* render it *“Bìshè”* (亳社). The *Lǐjì* *Jiāotèshēng* *“Bóshè běi yǒu”* (薄社北牖) has the *Shìwén* annotation: *“Also written as ‘Bì’ (亳).”* This confirms *“Pú”* (蒲) as an alternate for *“Bì”* (亳). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** states: *“Thin”* (薄) and *“adornment”* (华) form a rhyme. *“Adornment”* (华) in ancient pronunciation was akin to *“lín”* (荂), belonging to the *Yú* (鱼) and *Yú* (虞) phonetic groups. *“Thin”* (薄), derived from *“pǔ”* (溥), thus belongs to the *Yú* (鱼) and *Yú* (虞) entering tones.\n\n---\nThe *Jìnglóng* stele contains **129 characters** (consistent in *Dūnhuáng*, *Hé*, and *Wáng* manuscripts), while the *Fù* version has **131** and the *Fàn* version **133**. The *Héshàng* heading reads *“Chapter 38: On Virtue”* (论德第三十八), the *Wáng* version *“Chapter 38”* (三十八章), and the *Fàn* version *“Chapter 38: On the Supreme Virtue Not Being Virtue”* (上德不德章第三十八).\n\n---\n**Chapter 39: Those of old who attained the One**\nHeaven, having attained the One, became clear;\nEarth, having attained the One, became tranquil;\nThe *Spirit* (*shén*), having attained the One, became responsive;\nThe valleys, having attained the One, became full;\nAll things, having attained the One, came to life;\n**Qiān Zhī** notes: The character *“宁”* (ning) in the *Jìfú* stele was altered to *“宁”* (also ning) to avoid the Qing emperor’s taboo; here, it is restored to the original *“宁”* (as in tranquility), consistent with the stele’s text below.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** states: *“All things”* (万物) is the standard reading. **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The *Dūnhuáng* *Wù* manuscript omits this sentence. **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Jìngfú* and *Fàn* versions also render *“万”* (wàn) as *“万”* (wàn). Additionally, **Chén Bìxū** asserts: *“Yán Jūnping’s* text lacks *“All things, having attained the One, came to life”* (万物得一以生) and the following *“All things, without the One, would perish”* (万物无以生将恐灭), totaling **14 characters** omitted.\n\nThe sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, **established rectitude for the world** (*wéi tiānxià zhèng*).\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: The *Yùzhù* and *Wáng Bì* versions render *“下贞”* (xiàzhēn, “below as the true”). **Fàn Yìngyuán** explains: *“Zhēn”* (贞) means *“zhèng”* (正, rectitude). *Wáng Bì* and *Guō* follow the ancient text, though one variant renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正), likely due to taboo avoidance. The *Héshàng* version reads *“sovereigns and lords”* (侯王). **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Fù*, *Fàn*, and *Nài* manuscripts, as well as *Qúnshū Zhìyào*, **Sūn Shèng’s** *Old and New Doubts on Laozi*, the *Jìnshū* *Kǎi’ài* biography, and *Shūcháo* **149** all render it *“zhēn”* (贞). **Yán Zhūn**, *Héshàng*, *Gùhuān*, *Jìngfú*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Qìngyáng*, *Pányuān*, *Shitōchō*, and *Yùpiàn* under the *“一”* (yī) radical all cite *“zhèng”* (正), while the *Zhuōzhōu* version renders it *“zhèng”* (政). The *Zhōngdū Sìzǐ* manuscript reads *“with the world as rectitude”* (以天下为正). **Wáng Niánsūn** argues: The *Héshàng* version renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正), with the annotation *“to make the world orderly.”* **Niánsūn** further notes: The *Ěryá* states *“zhèng”* (正) means *“long”* (长). The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* *“Jūnshǒu”* (君守) passage *“can establish rectitude for the world”* (可以为天下正), with **Gāo Yáng’s** annotation *“zhèng”* (正) meaning *“master”* (主). *“To establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下正) is akin to the *Hóngfàn* statement *“to be master over the world”* (为天下主). The subsequent lines *“Heaven, without the One, would not be clear”* (天无以清) and *“Earth, without the One, would not be tranquil”* (地无以宁) echo the earlier *“Heaven, having attained the One, became clear”* (天得一以清) and *“Earth, having attained the One, became tranquil”* (地得一以宁). Further, *“sovereigns and lords, without the One, would not be noble and exalted”* (侯王无以贵高) directly follows *“to establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下正), proving *“zhèng”* (正) carries the meaning *“sovereign/master,”* not *“orderly.”* **Wáng Bì’s** version renders *“zhēn”* (贞), a borrowed character. **Dōngtiáo Yītáng** notes: *“To establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下贞) has a variant *“zhèng”* (正), conflicting with the annotation. The same applies below. The *Zhèngguān Zhèngyào* *“Xíngfǎ”* (刑法) **31** also renders it *“zhèng”* (正). **Péng Zhì** states: All manuscripts render *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正) to avoid taboo. **Yì Shùndǐng** notes: *“Zhēn”* (贞) and *“zhèng”* (正) were interchangeable in ancient usage. **Wángshì Shūshū Zházhì** claims *“zhēn”* (贞) is a borrowed character, though this is not entirely accurate. The *Yì* *“Zhēn shèng zhě yě”* (贞胜者也) cites Laozi: *“The sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, established rectitude for the world”* (王侯得一以为天下贞). **Wáng Bì’s** *Zhōuyì Lièlì* states: *“What governs all movement under Heaven is the One, established as true.”* **Xíng Yǐng’s** annotation on Laozi also renders it *“zhēn”* (贞). The *Wénxuǎn* *“Wáng Yuáncháng’s** *Qúshuǐ Shī Xù*” annotation likewise cites *“zhēn”* (贞). Thus, *“zhēn”* (贞) is the original character. **Láo Jiàn** notes: *“The sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, established rectitude for the world”* (侯王得一以为天下贞) renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正) in the *Jìnglóng* and *Jìngfú* versions, while the *Kāiyuán*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, and *Zhūwáng* manuscripts retain *“zhēn”* (贞).\n\n「Fàn Zhù’s annotation states: *“Zhēn (贞) is zhèng (正). One version originally had zhèng (正), but later scholars altered it to avoid taboo.”* According to the **Dàozàng** *Yùzhù* and *Yùshū* editions, the original text was *“zhèng”* (正), with the *shū* (疏) remarking: *“The original may have been written as ‘zhēn’ (贞), but zhēn (贞) is indeed zhèng (正).”* The **Kāiyuán** stone carving, however, later changed to *“zhēn”* (贞), and Fàn’s claim that *“later scholars altered it to avoid taboo”* is incorrect.\n\nAgain, in this chapter, whenever *“hóuwáng”* (侯王) appears, **Fù Yì** and **Fàn Zhù** render it as *“wáng hóu”* (王侯), which is incorrect. All **Táng** editions, **Róshàng Gōng**’s version, and the **Héshàng** edition retain *“hóuwáng”* (侯王), harmonizing with *“zhēn”* (贞) in the parallel rhyme structure of the passage. **Qiān Zhī** confirms: *“Zhēn (贞) is correct.”*\n\nThe *Yì Jìxù* states: *“All movement under Heaven is governed by establishing the One.”* It further says: *“This is to speak of attaining the One.”* In this passage of **Láozi**, *“hóuwáng dé yī wéi tiānxià zhēn”* (侯王得一以为天下贞), **Fù Yì**, **Fàn Zhù**, and the **Shìwén** annotation all include *“qí zhì zhī yī yě”* (其致之一也), aligning perfectly with the *Yì*’s meaning.\n\nMoreover, the **Luó** manuscripts and the **Osaka Túshūguǎn**’s old transcribed copy both read *“tiānxià zhēn”* (天下贞). **Shòuyě Zhíxǐ** notes: *“Even **Róshàng Gōng**’s version originally had ‘zhēn’ (贞), but the **Sòng** editions altered ‘zhēn’ (贞) to ‘zhèng’ (正) to avoid taboo against the word ‘empire.’”* Now, verified by the **Jǐnglóng** stele text, we know *“zhēn”* (贞) and *“zhèng”* (正) were interchangeably used in antiquity, and the taboo-avoidance theory is also incorrect.\n\n**Qiān Zhī** notes: The stele text and **Luó**’s version both read *“wú”* (无), not *“wú”* (无) with a dot, as a variant case.\n\n**Wǔnèi Fǎjīng**’s *Dūnyǐ* edition renders it as *“wú”* (无) with a dot. Additionally, in **Zhuāngzi**’s *Zhìlè* chapter: *“The **Tian** (天) does not act yet attains clarity, the **Dì** (地) does not act yet attains tranquility.”* The meaning originates here.\n\n**Liú Shīpèi** states: *“Fā (发) should be read as ‘fèi’ (废).”* The *Shuōwén* explains: *“Fèi (废), a house collapsing. One meaning: ‘fèi’ (废) as exhaustion.”* **Huáinánzǐ**’s *Lànmíng Xùn* uses *“sìjí fèi”* (四极废), with **Gāo Zhù** annotating: *“Fèi (废), exhaustion.”* The *Zhuǎnzǐng*’s *Dìng Sānnián* (定三年) uses *“fèi yú lú tàn”* (废于炉炭), with **Dù Zhù** explaining: *“Fèi (废), to fall.”* The meaning of exhaustion aligns with *“qīnghuī”* (倾圮). *“Jiāng tè fèi” (将恐发) is akin to saying *“jiāng tè bēnghuī”* (将崩圮), meaning the earth would collapse. *“Fā” (发) is the abbreviated form of *“fèi” (废).* **Jiǎng Xīchāng** agrees with **Liú Shīpèi**’s view. In **Zhuāngzi**’s *Lièyǔkòu* (列御寇), the annotation reads: *“Fā (发), Sīmǎ (司马) renders as ‘fèi’ (废).”* **Lièzǐ**’s *Huángdì* (黄帝) chapter cites it as *“fèi” (废).* The **Shìxìng** (缮性) text states: *“Not concealing one’s wisdom without letting it manifest”* (非藏其智而不发也), and the **Yùguǎn** (御览) *Yìmín* (逸民) section cites it as *“fèi” (废).* The *Zhuǎnzǐng*’s *Āi Shíyīnián* (哀十一年) annotation, quoting *Zhúshū Jìnián* (竹书纪年), states: *“Liáng Huìwáng fèi fèngjì zhī suǒ yǐ cì mín”* (梁惠王废逢忌之薮以赐民), while the **Hànshū** *Dìlǐ Zhì* (地理志) cites it as *“fā” (发).* These serve as further evidence. *“Fā” (发) and *“fèi” (废)* share the same initial consonant, hence their interchangeability.\n\nThis passage states: *“If the **Tian** (天) lacks clarity, it will fear collapse; if the **Dì** (地) lacks tranquility, it will fear exhaustion.”*\n\n*“If the **Shén** (神) lacks vitality, it will fear cessation; if the **Gǔ** (谷) lacks fullness, it will fear depletion.”* **Bì Qián** remarks: *“Jié” (竭), **Róshàng Gōng** and **Wáng Bì** both render as *“xiē”* (歇), but it should be *“jié”* (竭).* **Qiān Zhī** confirms: *“**Róshàng Gōng** and **Wáng Bì** both render *“jié”* (竭), but the preceding sentence reads *“xiē”* (歇), indicating **Bì Qián**’s correction is erroneous.*\n\nThe *Shuōwén* defines *“xiē”* (歇) as *“rest” or “exhaustion of breath.”* **Guǎngyǎ**’s *Shìgǔ* (释诂) II explains: *“Xiē (歇), exhaustion.”* In the *Qīfā* (七发): *“When vital breath is exhausted, all diseases arise.”* *“Jié” (竭)* is borrowed as *“kě”* (渴), meaning *“exhaustion” (from water), with the sound ‘màn’ (曼).”* The *Ēryǎ* (尔雅) *Shìgǔ* (释诂) states: *“Gù (涸), exhaustion.”* Classical texts often use *“jié”* (竭) for this meaning, indicating *“jié”* (竭) carries the sense of *“gù”* (涸) and *“jìn”* (尽). The *Zhōuyǔ* (周语) *“Yī, Luò jié ér Xià wáng”* (伊、洛竭而夏亡) is annotated as *“gù”* (涸). The **Huáinánzǐ** *Shuōlín* (说林) states: *“Deep springs cannot be exhausted.”* The **Běnjīng** (本经) says: *“Exhaust the marsh and fish.”* **Róshàng Gōng**’s annotation here reads: *“The **Gǔ** (谷) should have periods of fullness and emptiness, but if one only desires it to be perpetually full without limit, it will fear drying up and ceasing to be a marsh.”* *“Jié” (竭)* shares the same meaning as *“kě”* (渴), requiring no alteration.\n\n*“If all things lack the means to flourish, they will fear annihilation.”* **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The **Dūnhuáng** edition omits this sentence.\n\n*“If the **Hóuwáng** (侯王) lack the means to attain noble virtue, they will fear downfall.”* **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** observes: The **Jǐng** (景), **Suì** (遂), and **Dūn** (敦) three editions render *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王) consistently with the preceding text, and the latter part also aligns. The **Jǐng** (景) and **Suì** (遂) editions both have *“guì gāo”* (贵高), while the **Dūn** (敦) edition omits *“gāo”* (高); yet, the latter part refers to *“guì gāo”* (贵高) together, so *“gāo”* (高) should be retained. **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The **Dūnhuáng** edition has *“zhēn”* (贞) followed by *“ér”* (而). **Qiān Zhī** suggests: *“This sentence likely contains textual errors.”*\n\nAll **Héshàng** (河上), **Wáng** (王) editions, **Gùhuān** (顾欢) edition, **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Shìtóng** (室町), **Luó** (罗) manuscripts, and **Nǐjuàn** (柰卷) versions follow this reading. **Fàn Zhù**’s edition reads: *“Wáng hóu wú yǐ wéi zhēn, jiāng tè xī”* (王侯无以为贞，将恐溪). **Gāo Yì** (高翿) renders: *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn ér guì gāo, jiāng tè jué”* (侯王无以贞而贵高，将恐蹶). **Fù Yì** (傅奕) reads: *“Wáng hóu wú yǐ wéi zhēn ér guì gāo, jiāng tè xī”* (王侯无以为贞而贵高，将恐溪). **Péng Zhì** (彭耜) and **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯) agree with **Fù Yì**’s edition, except *“Wáng hóu”* (王侯) is rendered as *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王). **Yán Zūn** (严遵) follows **Péng Zhì**’s version, but *“wú yǐ wéi zhēn”* (无以为贞) is rendered as *“wú yǐ wéi zhèng”* (无以为正). All align with **Chuān Yùn Láozi**’s *Yìjiě* (绎解) and **Yán Zūn**’s interpretation.\n\n**Liú Shīpèi** argues: *“The preceding sentences—‘Tian wú yǐ qīng’ (天无以清), ‘Dì wú yǐ níng’ (地无以宁), ‘Shén wú yǐ líng’ (神无以灵), ‘Gǔ wú yǐ yíng’ (谷无以盈), ‘Wànwù wú yǐ shēng’ (万物无以生)—all follow the structure ‘wú yǐ [verb]’ (无以[动词]). However, this sentence ‘wú yǐ guì gāo’ (无以贵高) does not correspond with the preceding ‘wéi tiānxià zhēn’ (以为天下贞), suggesting ‘guì’ (贵) may be a corrupted form of ‘zhēn’ (贞).”*\n\n「Guì」 and 「zhēn」 share similar forms; later scholars, noting the passage in Wang Bi’s commentary—*\"qīng bùzú guì\"* (清不足贵)—altered 「zhēn」 to 「guì». Suspecting that 「guì gāo」 (贵高) was a redundant phrase, they further added 「gāo」 (高) beneath 「guì」 (贵) to align with the subsequent 「guì gāo」 (贵高). Yet in truth, 「guì」 (贵) should read as 「zhēn」 (贞), while 「gāo」 (高) is a superfluous insertion.\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) argues: It should read *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn, jiāng kǒng jué”* (侯王无以贞，将恐蹶), with 「zhēn」 (贞) mistakenly taken as 「guì」 (贵). Later scholars, seeing the following lines *“guì yǐ jiàn wéi běn, gāo yǐ xià wéi jī”* (贵以贱为本，高以下为基), assumed they followed the preceding text and arbitrarily added 「gāo」 (高) beneath 「guì」 (贵), thereby perpetuating the error and rendering the meaning incoherent.\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes: *“Jiāng kǒng xī”* (将恐溪) is rendered as *“jiāng kǒng jué”* (将恐蹶) in the **Zhūwáng** (诸王) edition. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *“jué”* (蹶) as *“jiāng”* (僵, stiff), from the foot radical with the phonetic *guì* (厥). It also states: *“One reading: tiào”* (跳, leap), also pronounced as *“xī”* (溪). The *Guǎngyùn* (广韵) defines *“jué”* (蹶) as *“shī jiǎo”* (失脚, stumble) or *“jiāng”* (僵, stiff), also written as *“xī”* (溪). The *Guǎngyá Shìgǔ* (广雅释诂) explains *“xī”* (溪) as *“bài”* (败, ruin). In *Lǚshì* (吕览) *Shènháng* (慎行), *“xiǎorén zhī xíng, bù xī yú shān”* (小人之行，不溪于山), the commentary reads: *“Xī”* (溪) means *“tīng zhì diān dùn”* (踬踬颠顿, stumbling and falling). In *Xúnzǐ* (荀子) *Chéngxiàng* (成相), *“guó nǎi xī”* (国乃溪), the commentary states: *“Diānfù”* (颠覆, overturn). Thus *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn, jiāng kǒng xī”* (侯王无以贞，将恐溪) means: *“If lords and kings lack integrity (zhēn), they risk ruin and losing their position.”* The *Húnán Dàoshàng Xuányì* (淮南道应训) and *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要) both cite *“xī”* (溪), while *Xià Jùn* (夏竦) in *Gǔwén Sìshēngyùn* (古文四声韵) and *Gǔ Lǎozǐ* (古老子) also use *“xī”* (溪).\n\nHence, *“guì yǐ jiàn wéi běn, gāo yǐ xià wéi jī”* (贵以贱为本，高以下为基). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes that the imperial commentary omits the *“wéi”* (为) beneath *“gāo”* (高), while the **Héshàng** (河上) version includes *“bì”* (必) beneath *“gāo”* (高). **Yǔ Huì** (宇惠) observes that in *Qíshì* (齐策), *“guì yǐ”* (贵以) and *“gāo yǐ”* (高以) are both preceded by *“suī”* (虽). **Qián Zhī** (谦之) further notes that in editions like *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Shìtōng* (室町), *Nǎijuǎn* (柰卷), *Gùhuān* (顾欢), as well as in *Húnán Dàoshàng Xuányì* (淮南道应训) and *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要), the *“yǐ”* (以) is preceded by *“bì”* (必). The *Húnán Yuándào Xuàn* (淮南原道训) states: *“Shìgù guìzhě bì yǐ jiàn wéi hào, ér gāozhě bì yǐ xià wéi jī”* (是故贵者必以贱为号，而高者必以下为基), which aligns with this passage.\n\nThus, *“Hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes that **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders *“bù gǔ”* (不毂) as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷). The **Héshàng** (河上) commentary explains: *“Bù gǔ”* (不毂) signifies *“bù néng rú chē gǔ wéi zhòng fú suǒ còu”* (不能如车毂为众辐所凑, unable to serve as the hub for all spokes). The same term appears in Chapter 42. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes that *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王) is rendered as *“Wánghóu”* (王侯) in the **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) editions, while the *Wénxuàn Xuěfù* (文选雪赋) annotation cites it as *“Wánggōng”* (王公). The term *“zì wèi”* (自谓) is rendered as *“wèi”* (谓) in the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition, and as *“chēng”* (称) in the **Péng Zhì** (彭耜), **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元), **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯), *Shìtōng* (室町), *Nǎijuǎn* (柰卷), and *Zhìyào* (治要) versions. **Yì Shùndǐng** (易顺鼎) argues that *“zì wèi”* (自谓) should read *“zì chēng”* (自称). In Chapter 42, it states: *“Rén zhī suǒ wù, wéi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, ér wánggōng wéi chēng”* (人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以为称). Thus, this passage must also read *“chēng”* (称). The *Húnán Gāo Zhù* (淮南高注) correctly uses *“chēng”* (称), and the *Wénxuàn Qiū Xīfàn yǔ Chén Bózī shū* (文选邱希范与陈伯之书) annotation cites it as *“Wánghóu zì chēng gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (王侯自称孤、寡、不谷), serving as further evidence.\n\n**Hóng Yìxuǎn** (洪颐烜) notes: In the *Déjīng* (德经), *“Shìyǐ hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (是以侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂), while the *Lǐjì Qūlǐ* (礼记曲礼) states *“Yú nèi zì chēng yuē bù gǔ”* (于内自称曰不谷), with **Zhèng Xùn** (郑玄) commenting: *“Gǔ”* (谷), meaning *“shàn”* (善, good). In the *Zuǒshī Lìsìnián Zhuan* (左氏僖四年传), *“Qǐ bù gǔ shì wéi”* (岂不谷是为), **Dù Yǔ** (杜预) annotates: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, zhūhóu qiáncí”* (孤、寡、不毂，诸侯谦辞). The character is consistently written as *“gǔ”* (谷). In *Lièzǐ Tiānrú Piān* (列子天瑞篇), *“yuān zhī wéi bù gǔ”* (鹯之为布毂), the *Shìwén* (释文) states: *“Gǔ”* (毂) is also written as *“gǔ”* (谷). **Héshàng** (河上) mistakenly reads *“gǔ”* (毂) as *“chē gǔ”* (车毂, wheel hub).\n\n**Xú Dǐ** (徐鼒) argues: According to the *Lǎozǐ Fǎ* (老子法), in this chapter *“Shìyǐ hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (是以侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂), the **Héshàng Zhāngjù** (河上章句) states: *“Bù gǔ”* (不毂) *“yù shì bù néng rú chē gǔ wéi zhòng fú suǒ còu”* (喻不能如车毂为众辐所凑). In the *“Dàohuà”* (道化) chapter, *“Rén zhī suǒ wù, wéi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, ér wánggōng wéi chēng”* (人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不毂，而王公以为称), the commentary states: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (孤、寡、不毂) *“bù xiáng zhī míng”* (不祥之名). **Dǐ** (鼒) asserts that the *“bù xiáng”* (不祥) interpretation is correct, while *“bù néng rú chē gǔ”* (不能如车毂) is a case of *“wàng wén shēngyì”* (望文生义, taking words at face value without ancient context). *“Gǔ”* (毂) and *“gǔ”* (谷) are interchangeable. In the *“Shī Zhēngyuè”* (诗正月), *“sùsù fāng yǒu gǔ”* (蔌蔌方有谷), the *Hòuhàn Cáiyōng Zhuan* (后汉书蔡邕传) renders it as *“sùsù fāng gǔ”* (速速方毂). In *Lièzǐ Tiānrú Piān* (列子天瑞篇), *“yuān zhī wéi bù gǔ”* (鹯之为布毂), the *Shìwén* (释文) states: *“Gǔ”* (毂) is also written as *“gǔ”* (谷). In *Lǚshì Guāntiáo Piān* (吕览观表篇), *“Wèi yòu zǎi gǔ chén”* (卫右宰谷臣), the *Wénxuàn Liú Xiàobié Guójue Liúlùn Zhù* (文选刘孝标广绝交论注) renders it as *“gǔ chén”* (毂臣). These are phonetically similar borrowed characters.\n\nThe term *“gǔ”* (毂) means *“shàn”* (善, good), as annotated by **Zhèng Xùn** (郑玄) in the *Qūlǐ* (曲礼), referring to one’s own unworthiness in a humble phrase. *“Gǔ”* (谷) also means *“lù”* (禄, blessing), as annotated by **Gāo Gòu** (高诱) in the *Húnán Rénjiān Xuàn* (淮南人间训), akin to *“bù lù”* (不禄, unblessed), also a humble phrase. **Wáng Bì**’s (王弼) edition also uses *“gǔ”* (谷). **Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (孤、寡、不谷) are indeed humble terms. In *Lǚshì Jūnshǒu Piān* (吕览君守篇), *“jūn míng gū, guǎ, ér bù kě zhàngyōng”* (君名孤、寡，而不可障壅), **Gāo Gòu** (高诱) annotates: *“Gū, guǎ”* (孤、寡) *“rénjūn zhī qiāncí”* (人君之谦辞). The stele inscription renders *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) as *“bù gǔ”* (不毂), where *“gǔ”* (毂) is a borrowed character for *“gǔ”* (谷).\n\nThe *Hou Han Shu* biography of **Cài Yōng** (后汉书蔡邕传) reads *“sùsù fāng gǔ”* (速速方毂), with the annotation: *“Gǔ”* (毂) means *“lù”* (禄). Since *“gǔ”* (谷) also means *“lù”* (禄), it is clear that *“bù gǔ”* (不毂) is the same as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷). Though *“gǔ”* (谷) is glossed as *“lù”* (禄), *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) does not carry the exact meaning of *“bù lù”* (unblessed). This is a regional dialect, akin to *“pú”* (仆, servant).\n\n**Zhāng Bǐnglín** (章炳麟) states:\n*“Zì chēng yuē pú”* (自称曰仆), originally meaning *“chénpú”* (臣仆, subject-servant), also carries the connotation of *“duǎn”* (short, humble). When nobles refer to themselves as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷), *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) is a phonetic fusion of *“pú”* (仆). The *Húnán Rénjiān Xuàn* (淮南人间训) annotation reads: *“Bù gǔ, bù lù yě”* (不谷，不禄也), but this is an instance of *“wàng wén shēng xuàn”* (望文生训, etymological fallacy). The ancients would not have used *“bù lù”* (unblessed) to refer to themselves in death. Further discussion is found in *Xīn Fāngyán* (新方言).\n\nIs this then treating *“jiàn”* (贱, lowliness) as the foundation? **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) says: *“Fēi”* (非), with the original manuscripts reading *“fēi hū”* (非乎).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nThe phrase *“cǐ qí”* (此其) appears in the imperial annotations, **Xíng Xuàn** (邢玄), **Qìngyáng** (庆阳), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Péng Zī** (彭耜), **Gāo Yì** (高翿), and **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯), all matching this inscription. **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) read *“shì qí”* (是其), while **Yán Zūn** (严遵) reads *“wéi sī”* (唯斯). The **Zhūhé** (诸河) and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts read *“cǐ fēi”* (此非). **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元) states:\n*“Wáng Bì”* (王弼) aligns with the ancient manuscripts, while **Héshànggōng** (河上公) reads *“cǐ fēi yǐ jiàn wéi běn yē, fēi hū”* (此非以贱为本邪，非乎). The current text follows the ancient manuscripts. Thus, **Fàn** (范) saw the **Wáng** (王) manuscript with *“fēi”* (非) as *“qí”* (其).\n\nThe character *“yē”* (耶), in the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) and **Yán Zūn** (严遵) manuscripts, is *“yǔ”* (与). **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Fù** (傅), and **Fàn** (范) read *“yě”* (也). The **Suìzhōu** (遂州) manuscript matches this inscription. **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes:\n*“Fēi”* (非) is written *“fēi yú”* (非欤) by **Fàn** (范), *“bēi hū”* (悲乎) by **Jǐngfú** (景福), and *“fēi yě”* (非也) in the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) manuscript. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Zuò qí”* (作其) is correct. This passage employs Chu dialect. **Jiǎng Xīchāng** (蒋锡昌) states:\nIn the *Shǐjì* (史记) *Gāozǔ Jì* (高祖纪), *“qí yǐ pèi wéi nǐ tāngmù yì”* (其以沛为朕汤沐邑), the *Jíjiě* (集解) cites *Fēngsú Tōng* (风俗通): *“Qí”* (其) is a Chu word. Since **Lǎozǐ** (老子) was from Chu, he should use Chu dialect. In Chapter 58, *“qí wú zhèng”* (其无正) is equivalent to *“wú zhèng”* (无正). In Chapter 77, *“qí bù yù jiàn xián”* (其不欲见贤) is equivalent to *“bù yù jiàn xián”* (不欲见贤). *“Shì qí yǐ jiàn wéi běn yě, fēi yú”* (是其以贱为本也，非欤) is equivalent to *“shì yǐ jiàn wéi běn yě fēi yú”* (是以贱为本也非欤).\n\nThus, *“gù zhì shù chē wú chē”* (故致数车无车). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes:\nThe imperial annotations and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) read *“shù yú wú yú”* (数舆无舆), while **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) in the upper text writes *“yú”* (舆) as *“yǔ”* (与), an error. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nThe two *“chē”* (车) characters appear in **Héshànggōng** (河上公), **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Shìmíng** (室町), and **Nǎijuǎn** (柰卷) manuscripts, matching this inscription. **Yán Zūn** (严遵) and **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) read *“yú”* (舆). **Yán** (严) writes *“zhì shù yú”* (致数舆) as *“zào yú yú”* (造舆于), with the **Dūn** (敦) manuscript ending the sentence with *“yě”* (也). The **Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ** (法京敦乙) manuscript writes the first *“chē”* (车) as *“yǔ”* (与) and the second as *“yù”* (誉), matching **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) and the imperial annotations. The **Suìzhōu** (遂州), **Fù** (傅), and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts read *“yù”* (誉) for both. **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元) states:\n*“Wáng Bì”* (王弼) aligns with the ancient manuscripts, while **Héshànggōng** (河上公) reads *“shù chē wú chē”* (数车无车). The current text follows the various **Wáng** (王) manuscripts reading *“yú”* (舆), while the **Dàozàng Wáng** (道藏王) manuscript and the **Dàozàng Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu** (道藏宋张太守) collated *Sìjiā Zhù* (四家注) also cite **Wáng Bì** (王弼) as *“gù zhì shù yù, nǎi wú yù yě”* (故致数誉，乃无誉也).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Zuò yù”* (作誉) is correct. The two *“chē”* (车) or *“yú”* (舆) are both errors for *“yù”* (誉), as *“yù”* (誉) and *“yǔ”* (与) were interchangeable in ancient script. *“Yù”* (誉) was mistakenly written as *“yú”* (舆) or *“chē”* (车). **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) and the **Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ** (法京敦乙) manuscripts are evidence of this.\n\nThe interpretation of *“shù chē wú chē”* (数车无车) varies. **Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) states:\n*“Zhūjiā jiě bù tōng”* (诸家解不通), and I say: *“Shù chē zhī gè jiàn, wú yī míng chē zhě”* (数车之各件，无一名车者), metaphorically meaning *“wǒ shì yī shēn, wú yī míng wǒ yě”* (我是一身，无一名我也). **Chéng Xuányīng** (成玄英) says:\n*“Yú”* (舆, vehicle) is *“chē”* (车), composed of *“xiāng”* (箱), *“fú”* (辐), *“gǔ”* (毂), and *“lèi”* (辋). Though named *“chē”* (车), in number it lacks substance. The five elements and four great directions are illusory—just as the body floats in emptiness, where shall nobility reside?\n\n**Lǐ Zhì** (李贽) says:\n*“Jīn fú lún, fú, gài, zhěn, héng, è, gǔ, xián\"* (今夫轮、辐、盖、轸、衡、轭、毂、), when combined, form *“chē”* (车). Yet people see only these parts—when have they seen *“chē”* (车) itself? Yet it is called *“chē”* (车), not *“lún, fú, gài, zhěn, héng, è, gǔ, xián”* (轮、辐、盖、轸、衡、轭、毂、).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nBoth **Lǐ** (李) interpretations reflect Buddhist teachings, as evidenced by the extant Pali *Mìlán Wáng Wèn Jīng* (弥兰王问经) and the lost *Nàxiān Bīqiú Jīng* (那先比丘经) from the Eastern Jin dynasty. The text reads:\n\n*“Nàxiān wèn Wáng: ‘Yán míng chē, hé suǒ wéi chē zhě? Zhóu wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Zhóu bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Lèi wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Lèi bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Fú wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Fú bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Gǔ wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Gǔ bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Yún wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Yún bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Káng wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Káng bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Gài wéi chē yě?’*\n\nThe text reads:\n\n*\"‘Gài wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Hé suǒ wéi chē zhě? Hé jù shì zhū cái mù, zhuó yī miàn níng wéi chē yě?’\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Hé jù shì zhū cái mù, zhuó yī miàn bù wéi chē yě.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Jiǎ lìng bù hé jù shì zhū cái mù, níng wéi chē yě?’\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Bù hé jù shì zhū cái mù, bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Yīn shēng wéi chē yě?’\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Yīn shēng bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Hé suǒ wéi chē zhě?’\n*Wáng biàn mòrán bù yǔ.*\n\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Fó shuō zhī, rú hé jù shì zhū cái mù, yòng wéi chē, yīn dé chē.

Shàn zāi!’*\n\n---\nTranslation:\n\n*\"‘Is the *gài* (盖) a chariot?’*\n*The King said: ‘What is a chariot? When all the materials are assembled and only one side is applied, is that a chariot?’*\n*The King said: ‘When all the materials are assembled and only one side is applied, that is not a chariot.’*\n*Nàxiān said: ‘If they are not assembled as all the materials, is that a chariot?’*\n*The King said: ‘If they are not assembled as all the materials, that is not a chariot.’*\n*Nàxiān said: ‘Is the *yīn shēng* (音声, sound) a chariot?’*\n*The King said: ‘The sound is not a chariot.’*\n*Nàxiān said: ‘What, then, is a chariot?’*\n*The King fell silent and spoke no word.*\n\n*Nàxiān said: ‘The Buddha taught this: when all the materials are assembled and used for a chariot, then it is a chariot. Humans are also like this. When the assembled parts—head, face, ears, nose, mouth, neck, shoulders, arms, bones and flesh, hands and feet, liver, entrails (*fǔ* 腑), heart, spleen, kidneys, intestines, stomach, complexion (*yán sè* 颜色), voice and sound (*shēng xiǎng* 声响), breathing, suffering and joy, good and evil—are assembled, that is called a human.’*\n*The King said: ‘Excellent! Excellent!’*\n\nSince the teachings of the Buddha entered China, there arose the saying of *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\").\n\nThe terms *\"zuò chē\"* (作车, \"to make a chariot\") and *\"zuò yù\"* (作舆, \"to make a carriage\") may share some meaning, yet they are not the original words of *Laozi*—this is quite evident.\n\nGao Yandi said: *\"Zhi yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\"). The *He Shang* (河上) version reads *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数舆无舆), while Wang Bi’s (王弼) and *Huainanzi Dao Ying* (淮南子道应训) versions read *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数舆无舆), all of which are strained interpretations that do not align with the original text.\n\nThe *Lu Shi* (陆氏) annotation explains the character *\"yù\"* (誉) as *\"huì yù\"* (毁誉, \"praise and blame\"). Thus, the original text should have been *\"yù\"* (誉).\n\nFrom *\"yù\"* (誉) it was corrupted to *\"yù\"* (舆, \"carriage\"), and from *\"yù\"* (舆) to *\"chē\"* (车, \"chariot\"). Later scholars mistakenly believed the annotation was incorrect, but this is not the case.\n\nIn the *Zhuangzi* chapter *\"Zhi Le\"* (至乐, \"Utmost Joy\"), it states *\"Zhi yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\"), followed by *\"Tian wú wéi yǐ zhī qīng, dì wú wéi yǐ zhī níng\"* (天无为以之清，地无为以之宁, \"Heaven acts without action and thus is clear; Earth acts without action and thus is tranquil\"). This clearly draws from the same passage, further confirming the original reading.\n\nLuo Yunxian said: *\"Yù\"* (誉) means *\"huì yù\"* (毁誉, \"praise and blame\"). Wu Cheng’s (吴澄) version reads *\"yù\"* (舆) instead of *\"yù\"* (誉), and Jiao Shi’s (焦氏) *Kao Yi* (考异) notes that *\"yù\"* (舆) was originally *\"yù\"* (誉). It is evident that *\"yù\"* (誉) is the correct character for meaning.\n\nI suspect the original text was *\"zhi shu yǔ wú yǔ\"* (致数与无与, \"extreme calculation of giving without giving\"), as *\"yù\"* (誉) and *\"yǔ\"* (与) were used interchangeably in ancient times (as in the *Zuo* commentary: *\"yù\"* or *\"yǔ\"*).\n\n*\"Shu\"* (数) means *\"counting\"* or *\"calculating\"*—so *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数誉无誉) means *\"extreme calculation of praise without praise\"*.\n\nThe *Houwang* (侯王, \"feudal lords and kings\") call themselves *\"gū\"* (孤, \"lonely\"), *\"guǎ\"* (寡, \"few\"), and *\"bù gǔ\"* (不谷, \"not abundant\"), which is *\"not calculating praise\"*, yet praise is still attributed to them. Thus, *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数誉无誉) is clearly understood.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* passage *\"Saying on Mountains\"* (说山训) states: *\"Qiú měi zé bù dé měi, bù qiú měi zé měi yǐ\"* (求美则不得美，不求美则美矣, \"If one seeks beauty, one does not attain beauty; if one does not seek beauty, beauty is attained\"). The annotation reads: *\"Xīn zì qiú měi zé bù dé měi míng yě, ér zì sǔn zé yǒu měi míng yě, gù Lǎozi yuē 'zhi shu yù wú yù'*\"* (心自求美则不得美名也，而自损则有美名也，故老子曰『致数舆无舆』也。), though the text reads *\"yù\"* (舆), the explanation is about *\"měi míng\"* (美名, \"good reputation\"), confirming that it should be read as *\"yù\"* (誉).\n\nThis interpretation is quite insightful.\n\n*\"Bù yù liáng liáng rú yù, luò luò rú shí\"* (不欲琭琭如玉，落落如石, \"One does not desire the lustrous like jade, nor the firm like stone\").\n\nYan Kejun said: *\"Luò luò\"* (落落) was rendered as *\"luò luò\"* (珞珞) in Wang Bi’s version.\n\nLuo Zhentian noted that the *Dunhuang* (敦煌) version reads *\"lù lù\"* (禄禄) or *\"luò luò\"* (落落).\n\nIn my examination: *\"Liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) was written as *\"lù lù\"* (碌碌) in *Jingfu* (景福) version, and *\"luò luò\"* (落落) as *\"shí\"* (石, \"stone\") in *Yu zhu* (御注), *Sui zhou* (遂州), *Qing Xuan* (邢玄), *Qingyang* (庆阳), *Pan Xi* (磻溪), *Lou Zheng* (楼正), *Shiming* (室町), *Nan juan* (柰卷), *Yan Zun* (严遵), *He Shang* (河上), *Gu Huan* (顾欢), *Peng* (彭), *Fan* (范), and *Zhao* (赵) versions, while *Jingfu* (景福) rendered it as *\"guò guò\"* (硌硌). Fu Yi (傅奕) and Fan (范) versions also read *\"ruò\"* (若) for both *\"rú\"* (如) characters.\n\nBi Qian said: *\"In ancient texts, there were no characters 'liáng' (琭), 'lù' (碌), or 'luò' (珞). 'Guò' (硌) should be corrected to 'luò' (落).\"*\n\nThe *Guangyun* (广韵) states: *\"Gōng děng lù lù\"* (公等录录) as *\"○○\"*. The *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) says: *\"○，suí cóng yě\"* (随从也, \"to follow\").\n\nThus, *Guangyun* (广韵) likely used *\"luò\"* (录) in its meaning.\n\nHong Yixian said: *\"Liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) is akin to *\"lù lù\"* (录录).\n\nThe *Guangya* (广雅) explains *\"lù lù\"* (逯逯) as *\"zhòng\"* (众, \"many\"). The *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) also states: *\"○，suí cóng yě\"* (随从也, \"to follow\").\n\nThese characters are used interchangeably.\n\nWang Bi’s version reads: *\"Guì wù yǐ duō ér jiàn jiàn, luò luò, shí jiān mào\"* (贵物以多而见贱。 落落，石坚貌。 石本贱物，以坚而自贞，是以两不欲也。), meaning: *\"Precious things are seen as cheap when they are many. 'Luò luò' (落落) is the firm appearance of stone. Stone is originally a cheap thing, yet it remains firm and steadfast, thus both are not desired.\"*\n\nThe *Yanzi Chunqiu* (晏子春秋) *Inner Chapters* (内篇) *Questions* (问) *Second Part* (下) states: *\"Jiān yǐ shí hū! Luò luò, shì zhī zé jiān, wú yǐ wéi jiǔ, shì yǐ sù wáng yě\"* (坚哉石乎！ 落落，视之则坚，无以为久，是以速亡也。), meaning: *\"Firm indeed is stone! 'Luò luò' (落落), when viewed, appears firm, yet it cannot endure for long, hence it perishes quickly.\"*\n\nThis aligns with the same meaning.\n\nGao Yandi said: *\"Liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) is recorded as *\"lù lù\"* (录录) in the *Shiji* (史记) *Pingyuanjun Zhuan* (平原君传), and *\"lù lù\"* (碌碌) in the *Hou Han Shu* (后汉书) *Feng Han Zhuan* (冯衍传), annotated as *\"lù lù wéi rén suǒ guì, luò luò wéi rén suǒ jiàn\"* (碌碌为人所贵，落落为人所贱。), meaning: *\"Lù lù (碌碌) is what people value, while luò luò (落落) is what people despise.\"*\n\nThe *He Shang* (河上) version annotated *\"liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) as *\"yǔ shuǒ liáng liáng\"* (琭琭喻少, \"represents few\"), and *\"luò luò\"* (落落) as *\"yǔ shuǒ duō\"* (落落喻多, \"represents many\"). Wang Bi interpreted *\"liáng liáng luò luò\"* (琭琭落落) as *\"tǐ jìn yú xíng\"* (体尽于形, \"fully embodied in form\").\n\nWang Yi’s (王逸) *Jiuxi* (九思) annotation states: *\"Guò guò\"* (硌硌, \"long and abundant in appearance\").\n\nAll these interpretations diverge from the original meaning of the text.\n\nMoreover, as evidence, *Mao Suo* (毛遂) ridiculed the nineteen men saying: *\"Gōng děng lù lù, yīn rén chéng shì zhě yě\"* (公等录录，因人成事者也。), meaning: *\"You gentlemen are long and abundant, relying on others to accomplish things.\"*\n\nIn the *Shi Jie* (世家) *Xiao He* (萧何) passage: *\"Lù lù wèi yǒu qí jiē\"* (录录未有奇节。), annotated as *\"lù lù yóu lù lù\"* (录录犹鹿鹿。), meaning: *\"Lù lù (录录) is akin to lù lù (鹿鹿).\"*\n\nXun Yue’s (荀悦) *Han Ji* (汉纪) *Wang Zhongyong* (王仲翁) criticism of *Xiao Wangzhi* (萧望之) states: *\"Bù lù lù, fǎn bào guān mù\"* (不碌碌，反抱关木。), meaning: *\"Not long and abundant, yet clinging to the gatekeeper’s staff.\"*\n\nThe *Hou Han Shu* (后汉书) *Ma Yuan Zhuan* (马援传) states: *\"Jīn gèng lù lù, yù wǎng zhī\"* (今更陆陆，欲往之。), meaning: *\"Now even more long and abundant, yet still desiring to go.\"*\n\nThe various interpretations are even more untenable.\n\nAccording to the *Shuō Wén* (说文): **«录」 (○), to follow and attend** (meaning: to be enslaved by others).\n\nThe *Suǒ Yǐn* (索隐) by Wáng Xiào (王劭) states: *\"Lù (录) is merely a borrowed character. The Shuō Wén says: ‘○○, the appearance of following and attending.’\"*\n\nThe *Guǎng Yùn* (广韵) under **«录»** cites Máo Suǒ (毛遂) as saying: *\"Gōng děng ○○, kě wèi yīn rén chéng shì ěr.\"* (公等○○，可谓因人成事耳。)\n\nThe *Shǐ Jì* (史记) also uses **«录」**. Thus, *jiāng (琭)*, *lù (碌)*, *lù (录)*, *lù (鹿)*, and *lù (陆)* are all borrowed forms of **«录」**, all conveying the meaning of *following and attending*, aligning with the criticisms of the earlier scholars and allowing for intuitive understanding.\n\nLater scholars, seeing only the characters for *jade* (玉) and *stone* (石) below, mistakenly took the radicals *jade* and *stone* as the correct forms, each proposing divergent interpretations without realizing their inconsistency.\n\nThe variants *luò (落)*, *luò (珞)*, and *gē (硌)* are merely scribal variations, now following the *Hòu Hàn Shū* (后汉书) *Gěng Wěn Zhuan* (耿弇传): *«Luòluò nán hé»* (落落难合), annotated as *«shū kuò mào»* (疏阔貌), meaning *spacious and disjointed*—unable to integrate with others—which directly contradicts the meaning of *following and attending*.\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\n*\"Jiāngjiāng (琭琭)\"* is sometimes written as *lùlù (碌碌)*, *lùlù (渌渌)*, *lùlù (禄禄)*, or *lùlù (鹿鹿)*.\n*\"Luòluò (落落)\"* is sometimes written as *luòluò (珞珞)* or *gēgē (硌硌)*, all being phonetic variations and scribal errors commonly used in antiquity.\n\nThe *Hòu Hàn Shū* (后汉书) *Féng Yǎn Zhuan* (冯衍传) annotation elaborates: *\"Kě guì kě jiàn, jiē fēi Dào zhēn. Yù mào luòluò, wéi rén suǒ guì; shí xíng luòluò, wéi rén suǒ jiàn.

The *Yán Zōng Běn* (严遵本) connects with the preceding chapter, sharing the same stone inscription. Additionally, the *Sòng Zhù Zhìjiān Shūyì* (宋赵志坚疏义) renders *\"fǎn\"* (反) as *\"fǎn\"* (返).\n\nFurther commentary: *\"Fǎn\"* (反) means **returning**, aligning with the *Yì* (易) interpretation. The *Yì* *Fù Tuàn* (易复彖) states:\n*\"Returning and reversing the **Dao**, seven days to return—this is the movement of Heaven, returning to reveal the essence of Heaven and Earth!\"*\nThe *Záguà Zhuàn* (杂卦传) says:\n*\"**Returning** is **reversal**.\"*\nThe *Gān Tuàn Zhuàn* (干彖传) states:\n*\"All day long, pressing and pressing—this is the **repeating** of the **Dao**.\"*\nThe *Tài Tuàn* (泰彖) declares:\n*\"Without levelness, there is no slope; without going, there is no **returning**.\"*\n\nThus, **\"returning\"** is the same as **\"reversing.\"** Hence, *Lǎozǐ* (老子) says:\n*\"When all things arise together, I observe their **returning**. Things drift like clouds, each **returning** to its root. Returning to the root is called **stillness**; stillness is called **restoring the mandate**.\"*\nHe also says:\n*\"**Returning** to the infant,\"*\n*\"**Returning** to the boundless,\"*\n*\"**Returning** to the uncarved block,\"*\n—all meaning **reversing and returning**.\n\n*\"Great is called **passing**; **passing** is called **distant**; **distant** is called **returning**,\"*\n—meaning one must first go far before **returning**.\n\n**Returning** is inherently **motion**; without motion, there is no **returning**, hence:\n*\"The **returning** is the **Dao’s** motion.\"*\n\n**Returning** is inherently **contrary**; only by being contrary does it become harmonious, hence:\n*\"The profound **virtue** is deep and far, contrary to things, and only then does it attain the greatest harmony.\"*\n\nAs for *\"the weak is the **Dao’s** use,\"* this aligns with the *Yì*’s *Kūn* (坤), where *Gān* (干) is hidden within *Kūn*, hence called **weak**. The *Yì* says:\n*\"The hidden dragon does not act,\"*\nwhile *Lǎozǐ* speaks of *\"the use of non-action,\"*—this is the **Dao’s** use.\n\n*\"All things under Heaven are born from existence; existence arises from non-existence.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Yán Kějūn (严可均):**\nThe *Héshàng Běn* (河上本) and *Wáng Běn* (王本) render *\"tiānxià wànwù\"* (天下万物) as *\"wànwù\"* (万物), while the *Yù Zhù* (御注) reads *\"zhī wù\"* (之物). **Commentary by Jiānzhī (谦之):**\nThe *Guāngmíng*, *Jǐngfú*, and *Yù Lǎn* (御览) all cite *\"wànwù\"* (万物), matching the stone inscription. *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóu Zhèng* (楼正), *Shìtīng* (室町), *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Gāo* (高), and *Zhào* (赵) all read *\"zhī wù\"* (之物), aligning with the *Yù Zhù*.

Here, since it speaks of *\"yǒu\"* (有) and *\"wú\"* (无), *\"tiānxià wànwù\"* (天下万物) should read *\"tiāndì wànwù\"* (天地万物) for greater coherence.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter is read without rhyme by *Jiāng Shì* (江氏), *Yáo Wéndiàn* (姚文田), and *Xí Dòng* (奚侗). *Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢), *Chén Zhù* (陈柱), and *Gāo Běnhàn* (高本汉) note that *\"dòng\"* (动) and *\"yòng\"* (用) rhyme, which is correct.\n\n**Note:** *Kǒng Guǎngsēn*’s *Shī Shēnglèi* (诗声类) categorizes *\"dòng\"* (动) and *\"yòng\"* (用) under *yángshēng* (阳声) *dōng* (东), *zhōng* (钟), and *jiāng* (江) as one rhyme group, citing *Lǎozǐ*:\n*\"The **returning** is the **Dao’s** motion; the **weak** is the **Dao’s** use.\"*\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng Bēi* (景龙碑) version contains **21 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng Běn* (敦煌本), *Héshàng Běn* (河上本), *Wáng Běn* (王本), *Fù Běn* (傅本), and *Fàn Běn* (范本) all match this.\n\nThe *Héshàng Běn* (河上本) titles this *\"Qùyòng dì sìshí\"* (去用第四十); the *Wáng Běn* (王本) titles it *\"Sìshí zhāng\"* (四十章); the *Fàn Běn* (范本) titles it *\"Fǎnzhě Dào zhī Dòng zhāng dì sìshí\"* (反者道之动章第四十).\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe superior person, hearing the **Dao**, diligently practices it;\n**Commentary by Yán Kějūn (严可均):**\n*\"Qín ér xíng zhī\"* (勤而行之), the *Yù Zhù* (御注) omits *\"zhī\"* (之), while *Fù Yì* (傅奕) renders it *\"ér qín xíng zhī\"* (而勤行之).\n\n**Commentary by Jiānzhī (谦之):**\nThe *Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ Běn* (法京敦乙本) reads *\"qín néng xíng\"* (懃能行), with *Luǒ Juàn* (罗卷) matching the stone inscription, differing from the *Wǔnèi Běn* (武内本). The *Fàn Běn* (范本) reads *\"qín\"* (懃), annotated as *\"gǔběn\"* (古本). **Note:** *Xià Sūn*’s (夏竦) *Gǔwén Sìshēngyùn* (古文四声韵) cites the ancient *Lǎozǐ* as *\"qín\"* (懃).\n\nThe middle person, hearing the **Dao**, holds it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nThe inferior person, hearing the **Dao**, **derides** it.\n\n**Commentary by Jiānzhī (谦之):**\nThe various manuscripts read *\"xiào\"* (笑), the *Suìzhōu Běn* (遂州本) reads *\"[missing character]\"*, and the *Yù Zhù* (御注) marks it *\"○\"*.

The *Bàopǔ Zǐ*’s *Wéizhǐ Piān* (抱朴子微旨篇) also states:\n*\"‘Dà ér xiào zhī’ (大而笑之), this has been long so.\"*\n\nNow, according to *Wáng*’s (王) explanation, this is correct. *\"Xiàshì wén dào, dà ér xiào zhī\"* (下士闻道，大而笑之) opposes the preceding *\"Shàngshì wén dào, qín ér xíng zhī\"* (上士闻道，勤而行之).\n\n*Fù Yì* (傅奕) renders:\n*\"Shàngshì wén dào, ér qín xíng zhī; xiàshì wén dào, ér dàxiào zhī\"* (上士闻道，而勤行之；下士闻道，而大笑之),\n—mistakenly placing the *\"ér\"* (而) at the sentence’s beginning. However, the *\"ér\"* (而) in the latter sentence still allows us to infer the original.\n\n*\"Ér qín xíng zhī\"* (而勤行之) is a misplacement of *\"qín ér xíng zhī\"* (勤而行之). Thus, *\"ér dàxiào zhī\"* (而大笑之) is a misplacement of *\"dà ér xiào zhī\"* (大而笑之), which can now be confirmed.\n\n**Commentary by Gāo Hēng (高亨):**\n*\"Wáng\"* (亡) is read as *\"wàng\"* (忘); the two characters were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Shī Jiǎ Yuè* (诗假乐) states *\"bù qiān bù wàng\"* (不愆不忘), and the *Shuōyuàn Jiànběn Piān* (说苑建本篇) cites *\"wàng\"* (忘) as *\"wáng\"* (亡).\n\nXúnzǐ’s *Effort in Learning* (劝学篇) reads *“yān màn wàng shēn”* (怠慢忘身), while the *Great Rites of Dài* (大戴礼·劝学篇) renders *“wàng”* (忘) as *“wáng”* (亡). In the *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋·权勋篇), it states *“shì wàng jīng guó zhī shèjì ér bù xù wú zhòng yě”* (是忘荆国之社稷而不恤吾众也), and similarly, the *Han Feizi* (十过篇) and *Huáinánzǐ* (人间篇) use *“wàng”* (忘) as *“wáng”* (亡). These serve as further evidence.\n\nThe *Shī* (诗·绿衣) states *“xīn zhī yōu yǐ, hé wéi qí wáng”* (心之忧矣，曷维其亡), with Zhèng’s annotation *“wáng zhī yán wàng yě”* (亡之言忘也), following the same pattern.\n\nThe *Yìjīng Liè Jiě* (周易·略例) declares:\n*“Cún yán zhě, fēi dé xiàng zhě yě; cún xiàng zhě, fēi dé yì zhě yě.\nWàng yán zhě, nǎi dé xiàng zhě yě; wàng xiàng zhě, nǎi dé yì zhě yě.”*\n(存言者，非得象者也；存象者，非得意者也。\n忘言者，乃得象者也；忘象者，乃得意者也.)\n\nHere, *“cún”* (存) and *“wàng”* (忘) are paired opposites, aligning with the passage’s structure. This does not suffice to elucidate the *Dao*.\n\nLǔ Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes that the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript includes *“zhī”* (之) after *“xiào”* (笑). Thus, the original text reads:\n*“Jiàn yán yǒu zhī”* (建言有之).\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) observes that the Imperial Commentary lacks the *“gù”* (故) character. My examination reveals that the editions by Xíng Xuán (邢玄), Jǐng Fú (景福), Qìngyáng (庆阳), Pánxī (磻溪), Lóuzhèng (楼正), Gāo Yì (高翿), and Shìmǎchōng (室町本) align with the Imperial Commentary. The *Wǔnèi Dūnyǐ* (武内敦乙本) and Gǔ Huān’s (顾欢) editions insert *“shì yǐ”* (是以) after *“jiàn yán”* (建言). Lǔ Zhènyù states that the *Dūnhuáng* text reads *“shì yǐ jiàn yán yǒu zhī yuē”* (是以建言有之曰). My review confirms that the Fù Yì (傅奕) and Fàn (范) editions also include *“yuē”* (曰).\n\nFàn Yìngyuán (范应元) notes that Wáng Bì (王弼), Sūn Dēng (孙登), and Ruǎn Xián (阮咸) follow the ancient manuscripts, while the Héshànggōng (河上公) edition omits *“yuē”* (曰). Xí Dòng (奚侗) argues that *“jiàn yán”* (建言) likely refers to an ancient text title.\n\nGāo Hēng (高亨) suggests *“jiàn yán”* (建言) may be the title of a book referenced by Lǎozǐ.\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子·人间世篇) cites *“fǎ yán”* (法言), the *Hùguānzǐ* (鹖冠子·天权篇) references *“yì yán”* (逸言), and the *Guǐgǔzǐ* (鬼谷子·谋篇) invokes *“yīn yán”* (阴言). The *Hànshū Yìwénzhì* (汉书·艺文志) lists *“huáng yán”* (谰言), with Bān Gu’s annotation *“bù zhī zhǔzhe”* (不知作者), demonstrating that naming texts with *“yán”* (言) was a common ancient practice.\n\n---\n明道若昧，进道若退，\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes that *“ruò lèi”* (若类) is rendered *“ruò chǎn”* (若颣) in the Imperial Commentary and Wáng Bì’s (王弼) edition.\n\nMy examination reveals:\n- *“Jìn dào ruò tuì”* (进道若退) has *“tuì”* (退) marked *“○”* in the Imperial Commentary.\n- Fù Yì (傅奕), Péng Zhì (彭耜), Lín Xīyì (林希逸), and Zhào Mèngfǔ (赵孟俯) place this sentence after *“yí dào ruò lèi”* (夷道若类).\n- The *“lèi”* (类) character appears in the *Shìwén* (释文), *Héshànggōng* (河上公), *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), and *Gǔ Huān* (顾欢) editions, while Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) use *“chǎn”* (颣).\n\nFàn (范) states:\n*“Chǎn”* (颣), in ancient manuscripts, is pronounced *“lěi”* (耒), referring to a silk node. The *Héshànggōng* (河上公) edition uses *“lèi”* (类). I follow the ancient manuscript here.\n\nMy review confirms *“chǎn”* (颣) and *“lèi”* (类) were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Guǎngyǎ* (广雅·释言) defines *“chǎn”* (颣) as *“jié”* (节), and the *Tōngsúwén* (通俗文) states *“duō jié yuē chǎn”* (多节曰颣). The *Jiǎnwén Zhù* (简文注) for *“yí dào ruò chǎn”* (夷道若颣) explains *“cī”* (疵, flaw). The *Huáinánzǐ Fànlùn* (淮南子·泛论) describes *“míngyuè zhī zhū, bùnéng wú chǎn”* (明月之珠，不能无颣), with the annotation *“chǎn, pán ruò sī zhī jié chǎn yě”* (颣，盘若丝之结颣也). Borrowed as *“lì”* (戾), the *Zuǒzhuàn Zhāoshí* (左传·昭十六) uses *“xíng zhī pō chǎn”* (刑之颇颣), with Shì Zhù (服注) defining it as *“bù píng”* (不平, unevenness). Since *“píng”* (平) and *“bù píng”* (不平) are opposites, *“yí dào ruò chǎn”* (夷道若颣) signifies *“the Way of uniformity appears flawed.”*\n\n---\n上德若谷，大白若辱，\nWǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) notes that the *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) manuscripts render *“gǔ”* (谷) as *“sú”* (俗). Lǔ Zhènyù (罗振玉) observes that *“dà bái ruò rǔ”* (大白若辱) appears before *“shàng dé ruò gǔ”* (上德若谷) in the *Dūnhuáng* text.\n\nMy examination of the *Lǔjuàn Dūnwù* (罗卷敦戊本) confirms *“gǔ”* (谷) is not written as *“sú”* (俗), differing from the *Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ* (法京敦乙本). Chéng Xuányīng (成玄英) explains:\n*“Gǔ”* (谷) was also written as *“sú”* (俗), meaning *“even one who embodies virtue can forget it, indistinguishable from the vulgar.”*\n\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states:\n*“All editions render it ‘gǔ’ (谷), a shorthand for ‘sú’ (俗). High virtue appears as the common crowd—embodying the meaning of blending with the world.”*\n\nAdditionally, the *Dàozàng Wángběn* (道藏王本) writes *“tài”* (太) instead of *“dà”* (大). The *“rǔ”* (辱) character is marked *“○”* in Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) editions.\n\nFàn (范) explains:\n*“○”* is pronounced *“rǔ”* (辱), meaning *“black filth.”* Ancient manuscripts follow this, while the *Héshànggōng* (河上公) edition uses *“rǔ”* (辱).\n\nBì Yàn (毕沅) notes:\n*“○”* is rendered *“rǔ”* (辱) in the *Héshànggōng* (河上公) and Wáng Bì (王弼) editions. Those writing *“○”* follow the principle of *“yǐ bái zào zī”* (以白造缁, transforming white into black). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) does not list *“○”*.\n\nMy review confirms the *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) defines *“○”* as *“gòuhēi”* (垢黑, filth and blackness), an ancient form of *“rǔ”* (辱). The *Guǎngyǎ Shìgǔ* (广雅·释诂三) states *“rǔ, wū yě, yòu è yě”* (辱, 污也, 又恶也, defilement and evil). The *Yílì Shìhūn Lǐ* (仪礼·士昏礼) annotates *“jīn wú zǐ rǔ”* (今吾子辱) as *“yǐ bái zào zī yuē rǔ”* (以白造缁曰辱). The *Sūwèn Qìjiāo Biàn Dàlùn* (素问·气交变大论) states *“hēi qì nǎi rǔ”* (黑气乃辱). Since *“rǔ”* (辱) carries the meaning of blackness, opposing *“bái”* (白), the phrase *“dà bái ruò rǔ”* (大白若辱) follows this contrast.\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) clarifies:\n*“Rǔ”* (辱) in the *Yílì Shìhūn Lǐ* (仪礼·士昏礼) annotation *“yǐ bái zào zī yuē rǔ”* (以白造缁曰辱) aligns with this usage. Transforming white into black—removing traces of defilement—hence *“rǔ”* (辱).\n\nThis reflects Lǎozǐ’s original intent, corroborated by the *Shīchuán* (诗传) and *Lǐzhù* (礼注).\n\n---\n广德若不足，\nMy examination of the *Zhuāngzǐ Yùyán Piān* (庄子·寓言篇) reveals:\n*“Lǎozǐ yuē: ‘Ér suīsuī xūxū, ér wéi yǔ jū? Dà bái ruò rǔ, shèng dé ruò bùzú.’”* (老子曰：“而睢睢盱盱，而谁与居？ 大白若辱，盛德若不足。”)\nThe final two sentences match this chapter.\n\n*«Yòu Shǐjì Lǎozǐ běnchuán* (又史记老子本传) further records Lǎozǐ’s original words: *“Liáng jiǎ shēncáng ruò xū, jūnzǐ shèng dé, róngmào ruò yú.”* (良贾深藏若虚，君子盛德，容貌若愚). It is suspected that *“guǎng dé”* (广德) is a corrupted form of *“shèng dé”* (盛德).\n\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) argues that this passage should follow the *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子), and *“shèng”* (盛) is the original text, which is correct. Yán Zūn (严遵)’s version as *“shèng dé”* (盛德) should be adopted.\n\nLǔ Juǎn (罗卷) renders *“ruò bùzú”* (若不足) as *“ruò rú”* (若濡), differing from all other versions.\n\n**Jiàn dé ruò tōu** (建德若偷),\nJìu yě Zhíxǐ (狩野直喜) states: *“Héshàng Gōng běn* (河上公本) and *Wáng Bì běn* (王弼本) originally had differing texts, but later scholars, following *Bùshì Yìxíng* (辅嗣义行), altered the text based on *Wáng Bì*’s version, causing the two to merge indistinguishably. Fortunately, old manuscript copies (*jiùzhāo* 旧钞) suffice to correct the errors in the printed editions.\n\nIn Chapter 41, *“jiàn dé ruò tōu, zhì zhēn ruò yú”* (建德若偷，质真若渝), this version (*qiānzhī’ān* 谦之案: referring to Lǔ Juǎn’s text) renders *“tōu”* (偷) as *“ruò yú”* (若揄). The annotation reads: *“Yú”* (揄) is the same as *“yǐn”* (引), as proven by the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文手部): *“Yú, yǐn yě”* (揄，引也). The *Hànfēizǐ Dìxié Piān* (韩非子饰邪篇) states: *“Páng yuǎn yú bīng ér nán”* (庞援揄兵而南). The *Hànshū Lǐyuèzhì* (汉书礼乐志) mentions *“shén zhī yú”* (神之揄), with *Yán Shīgǔ* (颜师古) annotating: *“Yú, yǐn yě”* (揄，引也). Thus, the evidence confirms their difference.\n\nIt is clear that the two schools’ original texts differ, and their interpretations also vary. Later generations, lacking discernment, arbitrarily changed *“yú”* (揄) to *“tōu”* (偷) to align with *Wáng Bì*’s version, and the annotation was also altered to *“tōu”*, rendering *Héshàng Gōng*’s original meaning entirely obscure.\n\nMoreover, it is noted that the *Táng Jǐnglóng Kèshí* (唐景龙刻石) reads *“jiàn dé ruò tōu”* (建德若偷), … thus proving that *Héshàng Gōng*’s version was corrupted by *Wáng Bì*’s as early as the Tang Dynasty. *Qiānzhī’ān* (谦之案): Indeed, *Héshàng Gōng*’s version was corrupted by *Wáng Bì*’s. Only this sentence—*Dùnhuáng běn* (敦煌本) omits it, while *Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng Bì* both have *“tōu”* (偷), matching the stone inscription. The *Guǎngmíng běn* (广明本) and *Fù* (傅本) also have *“tōu”*, while *Gāo Yì* (高翿) has *“shū”* (输), and *Nài Juǎn* (柰卷) and *Shìdōng* (室町本) have *“yú”* (揄).\n\nFàn Yìngyuán (范应元) states: *“Shū”* (输), as *Fù Yì* (傅奕) says, was originally *“shū”* (输), citing *“Guǎngyùn”* (广韵) which defines *“shū”* as *“yú”* (愚). *Héshàng Gōng*’s *“yú”* (揄) is a grass script error (*cǎozì* 草字), substituting *“chē”* (车) for *“shǒu”* (手). *Fù Yì* says: *“Shǒu”* (手) was mistaken in transmission across generations, how much more so *“rǔ”* (辱) missing *“hēi”* (黑)!*”*\n\n*Fù Yì*’s version at the time must have had evidence to support it. *Wáng Bì*’s version has *“tōu”* (偷), while *Dòng Yù* (董遇) has *“yáo”* (摇); now we follow the ancient version (*gǔběn* 古本).\n\nThe *Shuōwén* (说文) defines *“tōu”* (偷) as *“qiǎo xiá yě”* (巧黠也), from *“nǚ”* (女), with the sound of *“yú”* (俞声). The character is also written as *“tōu”* (偷). *Zhū Qūnshēng* (朱骏声) explains: *“Tōu”* (偷) is borrowed as *“yú”* (愉), in the *Hànshū Shíhuòzhì* (汉书食货志): *“Mín tōu gānshí hào yī”* (民偷甘食好衣). The *Lù Wēnshū zhuàn* (路温舒传) uses *“tōu wéi yīqiè”* (偷为一切), with the annotation *“gǒuqiě yě”* (苟且也). The *Lǐjì Biǎojì* (礼记表记) states *“ān sì yuē tōu”* (安肆曰偷). The *Zuǒ Wén shíqī zhuàn* (左文十七传) mentions *“Qí jūn zhī yǔ tōu”* (齐君之语偷), with the annotation *“gǒuqiě”* (苟且). Additionally, the *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋) says *“jiāo mín yǐ tōu lè”* (剿民以偷乐), with the annotation *“yú jiùxìng yě”* (犹侥幸也). The *Hòuhàn Zhāng Héng zhuàn* (后汉张衡传) states *“suī àoyóu yǐ tōu lè xī”* (虽遨游以偷乐兮), with the annotation *“huái ān yě”* (怀安也). The *Ěryǎ Shìyán* (尔雅释言) defines *“tiāo”* (佻) as *“tōu yě”* (偷也). *Xúnzǐ Xiūshēn* (荀子修身) and *Fēi Shí’ěr zǐ* (非十二子) both use *“tōu rú”* (偷儒), with the annotation *“dāng wéi shū, gǒu bì yú shì yě”* (当为输，苟避于事也). *“Tōu”* (偷) is also used as *“yú”* (揄).\n\nFrom the above, *“tōu”* (偷), *“shū”* (输), *“yú”* (揄), and *“shū”* (愉) were interchangeable in ancient usage, and *“tōu”* (偷) is the original text (*gùshū* 故书).\n\nYú Yì (俞樾) states: *“Tōu”* (偷) in *Héshàng Gōng*’s annotation means *“ruòkě tōu yǐn, shǐ kōngxū yě”* (若可偷引，使空虚也). *Wáng Bì*’s annotation reads: *“Tōu, pǐ yě”* (偷，匹也). *“Jiàn dé zhě tōu”* (建德者偷), meaning one who upholds **Dao**/**Way** and **Virtue/Power** acts like a simple, unassuming matchmaker (*pǐ* 匹), neither imposing nor contriving, thus resembling *“tōu”* (偷) as *“pǐ”* (匹).\n\nHowever, the meaning of *“tōu pǐ”* (偷匹) is unattested in antiquity, and its interpretation is difficult to grasp.\n\nNow, *“jiàn”* (建) should be read as *“jiàn”* (健). The *Shìmíng Shìyányǔ* (释名释言语) states: *“Jiàn, jiàn yě, néng yǒu suǒ jiànwéi yě”* (健，建也，能有所建为也). Thus, *“jiàn”* (建) and *“jiàn”* (健) share the same pronunciation, and the meaning also becomes clear. *“Jiàn dé zhě tōu”* (健德若偷) means that **Virtue/Power** that is robust and vigorous (*jiàn* 健) paradoxically appears as lazy and indolent (*tōu* 偷).\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the preceding sentence *“guǎng dé ruò bùzú”* (广德若不足).\n\n**Zhì zhēn ruò yú** (质真若渝),\n*Qiānzhī’ān* (谦之案): *Fù Yì*’s version reads *“zhì zhí ruò shū”* (质直若输), and *Nài Juǎn* (柰卷) also renders *“zhēn”* (真) as *“zhí”* (直). *“Yú”* (渝) and *“shū”* (输) are interchangeable in ancient script.\n\nBì Qián (毕沅) states: *“Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng Bì* both have *“yú”* (渝), which aligns with ancient usage, such as *“yú píng”* (渝平) in the *Chūnqiū* (春秋) being *“shū píng”* (输平).\n\n*“Shū”* (输) is borrowed as *“yú”* (愉), carrying the sense of *“gǒuqiě huái ān”* (苟且怀安), and is also used as *“yú”* (渝). The *“zhēn”* (真) in *“zhì zhēn”* (质真) is a corrupted form of *“zhí”* (直). *“Zhì ruò yú”* (质若渝) refers to the sincere and unadorned (*zhì* 质) individual whose actions are sluggish and weak (*yú* 渝), resembling one who is dull and foolish (*shū* 输).\n\n「Liu Shīpèi states: Examining the passage above, *“Guǎngdé ruò bùzú, Jiàndé ruò tōu”* (广德若不足，建德若偷), this parallels the earlier paired phrases, and it is suspected that *“zhēn”* (真) should also be read as *“dé”* (德). Indeed, the character *“dé”* (德) in the original text is written as *“”* (a variant of 德), resembling *“zhēn”* (真).\n\n*“Zhìdé”* (质德) aligns with *“Guǎngdé”* (广德) and *“Jiàndé”* (建德) in structure. *“Guǎngdé”* (广德) signifies broad and expansive **virtue** (德), contrasting with *“bùzú”* (不足); *“Jiàndé”* (建德) denotes firm and resolute **virtue** (德), opposing *“tōu”* (偷) (following Yu’s interpretation); *“Zhìdé”* (质德) represents unadorned **virtue** (德), countering *“yú”* (渝). These three **virtues** (德) are thus paired in meaning.\n\n大方无隅,\n大器晚成,\n大音希声,\n大象无形.\n\n**Dao** (道) is subtle and nameless.\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): The *Fǎjīng* (法京) edition reads *“wú”* (无) as *“wú”* (无), while the *Luójuàn* (罗卷) consistently renders it as *“wú”* (无).\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) remarks: *“Dàfāng wúhuán”* (大方无隅) is recorded in *Moral Reflections on the Way* (道德指归论) as *“Dàfāng bùjǔ”* (大方不矩).\n\nGù Guǎngqì (顾广圻) notes: *“Dàyīn xīshēng”* (大音希声), the *Fù* (傅) edition renders *“xī”* (希) as *“xī”* (稀), which is the same character.\n\nWáng Xiānshèn (王先慎) observes: The *Fù* (傅) edition reads *“yīn”* (音) as *“yán”* (言), differing entirely from all other versions.\n\nLǐ Qiào (李翘) states: *“Lǜshì Chūnyǒu Lèchéng Piān”* (吕氏春秋乐成篇) begins with *“Dàzhì bùxíng, dàqì wǎnchéng, dàyīn xīshēng”* (大智不形，大器晚成，大音希声), which does not cite **Laozi** (老子).\n\nIt is only **Dao** (道) that is both generous and good.\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: *“Shàn yú qiě shàn”* (善贷且善) is rendered *“qiěchéng”* (且成) in other editions.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version reads *“dài”* (贷) as *“shǐ”* (始).\n\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): The *Lùoluó* (譣罗) and *Dūnhuáng Yǐběn* (敦煌乙本) omit the *“wúmíng”* (无名) clause; thus, *“dài”* (贷) being read as *“shǐ”* (始) aligns with **Laozi**’s *Yìběn* (义本). The *Fù* (傅) edition, along with the *Zhūrōng* (诸王本) and *Shìzhōngdīng* (室町本), reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), while the *Fàn* (范) edition renders *“shàn huò qiě shànchéng”* (善货且善成). It is said: *“Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) follow the ancient version; *Héshàng Gōng* (河上公) reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), and now we follow the ancient version.” However, the *Yílántáng Yánběn* (怡兰堂严本) also reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), differing from the *Fàn* (范) edition, which likely omits one *“shàn”* (善) character, while the stele version omits *“chéng”* (成) at the end of the sentence. It is proper to augment according to the *Fàn* (范) edition.\n\n*“Chéng”* (成) rhymes with *“chéng”* (成), *“shēng”* (声), *“xíng”* (形), *“míng”* (名).\n*“Dài”* (贷) shares meaning with **Zhuangzi**’s *“Huàdài wànwù ér mín fùshì”* (化贷万物而民弗恃) in *Yìngdìwáng Piān* (应帝王篇), where it describes **Laozi**’s words.\n\n*“Dàoxuàn wúmíng”* (道隐无名) also echoes **Zhuangzi**’s *“Yǒu mòjǔ míng, shǐ wù zìxǐ”* (有莫举名，使物自喜), meaning the attainment of **dharma** (功) without claiming fame, standing in the incomprehensible, and wandering in the boundless.\n\nYú Shěngwú (于省吾) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition reads *“Fūwéidào, shànyú qiěshàn”* (夫唯道，善贷且善), likely omitting *“chéng”* (成). The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version reads *“shǐ”* (始) for *“dài”* (贷), which is a phonetic transformation.\n\nFrom the *Zhōuyǔ* (周语): *“Chúnmíng zé zhōng”* (纯明则终), commentary: *“Zhōng”* (终) means *“chéng”* (成).\nAgain, *“Gù gāomíng lìngzhōng”* (故高明令终), commentary: *“Zhōng”* (终) is synonymous with *“chéng”* (成).\nFrom the *Shū* (书), *“Xiāosháo jiǔchéng”* (箫韶九成), *Zhèng Zhù* (郑注) states: *“Chéng”* (成) is equivalent to *“zhōng”* (终).\nThus, *“chéng”* (成) and *“zhōng”* (终) are interchangeable, with the same meaning.\n\nThen *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成) is equivalent to *“shànyú qièzhōng”* (善贷且终).\nChapter Sixty-Four reads *“shèngzhōng rúshǐ”* (慎终如始), where *“zhōng”* (终) and *“shǐ”* (始) are paired in meaning.\n\n【Sound and Rhyme】Jiāngshì (江氏) reads this chapter in the following rhyme scheme:\n- *“Xíng, wáng”* (行、亡) in the *Yángbù* (阳部) rhyme.\n- *“Xiào, dào”* (笑、道) in the *Yōuxiào tōngyùn* (幽、宵通韵) rhyme, with *“dào”* (道) rhyming with *“dào”* (盗).\n\n- *“Mèi, tuì, lèi”* (昧、退、类) in the *Zhǐbù* (脂部) rhyme, *“mèi”* (昧) pronounced *“mèi”* (寐), *“tuì”* (退) as *“tùi”* (吐位反).\n\n- *“Gǔ, rǔ, zú, tōu, yú, huán”* (谷、辱、足、偷、渝、隅) in the *Hòubù* (侯部) rhyme, *“yú”* (渝) as *“yù”* (喻蓲反), *“huán”* (隅) as *“é”* (俄蓲反).\n\n- *“Chéng, shēng, xíng, míng, chéng”* (成、声、形、名、成) in the *Gēngbù* (耕部) rhyme.\n\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): *“Xiào”* (笑) belongs to the *Xiàobù* (宵部), *“dào”* (道) to the *Yōubù* (幽部), with *Yōu* (幽) and *Xiào* (宵) being interchangeable. *“Wéidào”* (惟道) should rhyme with *“dào”* (盗), which seems incorrect. *“Dào”* (道) is *“túhào”* (徒皓切), while *“dào”* (道) in ancient times was *“túgǔ”* (徒苟切). *“Dào”* (道) is an initial sound, rhyming with *“shǒu”* (守), *“jiù”* (咎) in Chapter Nine; with *“yǒu”* (有) in Chapter Ten; and with *“yǒu”* (牖), *“shào”* (少) in Chapter Forty-Seven. These are the proofs of its usage.\n\nFurthermore, *“gǔ, rǔ, zú, tōu, yú, huán”* (谷、辱、足、偷、渝、隅) belong to one rhyme, with *Yáo Wéntián* (姚文田) and *Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢) dividing them into *“gǔ, rǔ, zú”* (谷、辱、足) in the *Liùxià rùshēng* (六屋入声) rhyme, and *“tōu, yú, huán”* (偷、渝、隅) in the *Shísān hòu píngshēng* (十三侯平声) rhyme.\n\nAdditionally, the *“tōu”* (偷) in *“Jiàndé ruò tōu”* (建德若偷) is rendered *“tōu”* (偷) in the *Gāoběn* (高本) and *“shū”* (输) in the *Hànběn* (汉本), both of which rhyme.\n\nGù Yánwú (顾炎武) states: *“Xíng”* (行), in ancient pronunciation, was *“háng”* (杭). Referring to **Laozi**’s words: *“Shàngshì wéndào, qín ér xíngzhī; zhōngshì wéndào, ruòcún ruòwáng”* (上士闻道，勤而行之；中士闻道，若存若亡). Again, *“Gù ruòzhī shèngqiáng, róuzhī shènggāng”* (故弱之胜强，柔之胜刚) reads *“tōu”* (偷) as *“tú”* (俞) in the *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正卷五十二庚). He also notes: The four sentences follow a two-rhyme pattern, with the particle *“zhī”* (之) sometimes present and sometimes absent, as seen in other poems.»\n\n**Laozi** states: *“Shàngshì wéndào, qín ér xíngzhī; zhōngshì wéndào, ruòcún ruòwáng”* (上士闻道，勤而行之；中士闻道，若存若亡), where *“xíng”* (行) rhymes with *“wáng”* (亡).\nAgain, in the *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正卷十七), under *“Shísān mò”* (十三末): *“Mèi”* (昧), in examining ancient texts, is sometimes pronounced with a departing tone and sometimes with an entering tone. With a departing tone, it is *“mòpèi”* (莫佩反). In **Laozi**’s *“Míngdào ruò mèi, yídào ruò lèi, jìndào ruò tuì”* (明道若昧，夷道若类，进道若退).\nAgain, in the *Hòubù* (侯部) of *Tángyùn zhèng* (卷六十九侯): *“Tōu”* (偷), in ancient pronunciation, was *“tú”* (俞). In **Laozi**’s *“Jiàndé ruò tōu, zhìzhí ruò yú, dàfāng wúhuán”* (建德若偷，质直若渝，大方无隅).\n\nDeng Tingzhen states: *“Tōu, yú, yú”* (偷、渝、隅) form a rhyme. *“Yú”* (渝), in ancient pronunciation, was read as *“yú”* (羭). In the *Shījīng* (詩經), *“Zhōu liú”* (羔裘), *“shěmìng bù yú”* (舍命不渝), rhymes with *“hóu”* (侯).\n\n*“Yú”* (隅), in ancient pronunciation, was read as *“gài”* (盖) with a level tone akin to *“ǒu”* (耦). In the *Shījīng* (詩經), *“Chóu miù”* (绸缪), *“sān xīng zài yú”* (三星在隅), rhymes with *“xiù”* (逅).\n\nBoth *“tōu”* (偷), *“yú”* (渝), and *“yú”* (隅) are ancient *Hòu* (侯) department characters.\n\nHe also states: *“Yú”* (俞) and *“yú”* (禺) share the same modern pronunciation as *“yú”* (鱼) and *“yú”* (虞), yet in ancient times both belonged to the *Hòu* (侯) department. Thus, words derived from *“yú”* (俞) or *“yú”* (禺) should all be classified under *Hòu*.\n\n**Laozi** states: *“Shàngdé ruò gǔ, dàbái ruò rǔ, guǎngdé ruò bùzú, jiàndé ruò tōu, zhìzhí ruò yú, dàfāng ruò yú”* (上德若谷，大白若辱，广德若不足，建德若偷，质直若渝，大方若隅).\n\n*“Gǔ”* (谷), *“rǔ”* (辱), and *“zú”* (足) are all *Hòu* (侯) department entering-tone characters, while *“tōu”* (偷) and *“yú”* (渝) are *Hòu* (侯) department level-tone characters. Since *“yú”* (隅) rhymes with them, all words derived from *“yú”* (禺) belong to the same category as *“yú”* (隅), not merely those like *“ǒu”* (偶), *“ǒu”* (耦), *“ǒu”* (藕) collected in the *Hòu* (厚) department of *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **95 characters**, while the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Hé* (河), and *Wáng* (王) versions match it. The *Fù* (傅) version contains **97 characters**, and the *Fàn* (范) version has **98 characters**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *“Tóngyì dì sìshíyī”* (同异第四十一), the *Wáng* (王) version *“Sìshíyī zhāng”* (四十一章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *“Shàngshì wéndào zhāng dì sìshíyī”* (上士闻道章第四十一).\n\n**Chapter 42**\nDao/Way generates One (一), One generates Two (二), Two generates Three (三), and Three generates all things.\n\nDeng Tingzhen’s annotation: The *Huáinánzǐ Tiānwén Trùn* (淮南子天文训) states: *“Dào rì guī, shǐ yú yī”* (道日规，始于一). Wang Pennisun (王念孙) remarks: *“Rì guī”* (日规) does not align with the meaning of the surrounding text; it is a mistaken interpolation from *“gù shuō guī shēng jǔ shāi”* (故曰规生矣杀) above.\n\nThe *Sòngshū Lǜshū* (宋书律书) reads: *“Dào shǐ yú yī”* (道始于一), without *“rì guī”* (日规).\n\nToday’s annotation confirms Wang’s explanation. The *Huáinán Yì* (淮南义) cites **Laozi**’s chapter, thus the following passage states: *“Yī ér bù shēng, gù fēn ér wéi yīnyáng, yīnyáng hé hé ér wànwù shēng. Gù shuō yī shēng èr, èr shēng sān, sān shēng wànwù”* (一而不生，故分而为阴阳，阴阳合和万物生。 故曰一生二，二生三，三生万物).\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ Tiāndì Piān* (庄子天地篇) states: *“Tàichū yǒu wúwú, yǒu wúmíng, yī zhī suǒ qǐ, yǒu yī ér wèi xíng”* (泰初有无无，有无名，一之所起，有一而未形), which echoes **Laozi**’s *“Wúmíng, tiāndì shǐ”* (无名，天地始) and *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一).\n\nThe *Huángdì Nèijīng Tàisū Juàn shíjiǔ Zhīzhēnshí Piān Yángshàngshàn Zhù* (黄帝内经太素卷十九知针石篇杨上善注) also states: *“Cóng Dào shēng yī, wèi zhī pǔ yě; yī fēn wéi èr, wèi zhī tiāndì yě; cóng èr shēng sān, wèi zhī yīnyáng hé qì yě; cóng sān yǐ shēng wànwù, fēn wéi jiǔ yě, sì shí, rìyuè nǎiwéi wànwù”* (从道生一，谓之朴也； 一分为二，谓天地也； 从二生三，谓阴阳和气也； 从三以生万物，分为九野、四时、日月乃至万物). These words are also derived from here.\n\nDeng further notes: *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一), where *“yī”* (一) refers to *qì* (气). The *Zhuāngzǐ Zhīběi Yóu Piān* (庄子知北游篇) states: *“Tōng tiānxià yī qì ér, shèngrén gù guì yī”* (通天下一气耳，圣人故贵一). Li Daochun (李道纯) remarks: *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一) means *“vacuity and nothingness generate One *qì* (气)”; *“yī shēng èr”* (一生二) means *“One *qì* (气) differentiates into Yin and Yang”*.\n\nZhao Zhijiàn (赵志坚) states: *“Yī”* (一) is *“yuánqì”* (元气), the beginning of Dao/Way. *“In ancient times, all things under heaven, including Yin and Yang, received One *qì* (气) and thus came to life”*.\n\nDàtiān Qíngxuān (大田晴轩) states: *“Yī èr sān”* (一二三) has been interpreted in various ways by scholars. *“I examine the *Huáinánzǐ Tiānwén Trùn*: ‘*Guī shēng jǔ shāi, héng zhǎng quán cáng, shéng jū zhōngyāng, wéi sìshí gēn* (规生矩杀，衡长权藏，绳居中央，为四时根). *Dào rì guī, shǐ yú yī, yī ér bù shēng, gù fēn ér wéi yīnyáng, yīnyáng hé hé ér wànwù shēng.

This interpretation is most fitting.\n\nHe also states: *“Dào”* (道) is *“principle”*; *“yī”* (一) is *“One *qì* (气)”*. As *Zhuāng Zhōu* (庄周) says: *“Yī zhī suǒ qǐ, yǒu yī ér wèi xíng”* (一之所起，有一而未形). *“Èr”* (二) is *“Yin and Yang”*; *“sān”* (三) is *“the initial emergence of form, *qì* (气), and substance”*.\n\nIn **Chapter 14**, it states: *“Cǐ sān zhě bùkě zhì jié, gù hùn ér wéi yī”* (此三者不可致诘，故混而为一). This refers to the aforementioned three.\n\nThe meaning is: *“Dao/Way generates One *qì* (气); One *qì* (气) differentiates into Yin and Yang; *qì* (气) flows and transforms between heaven and earth, taking form and substance, and then all things are born. Hence, it is said: ‘Three generates all things.’”* (万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和).\n\nDeng Tingzhen’s annotation: The *Huáinánzǐ Jīngshén Trùn* (淮南子精神训) quotes: *“Wànwù bèi yīn ér bào yáng, chōng qì yǐ wéi hé”* (万物背阴而抱阳，冲气以为和). Gāo Yù (高诱) annotates: *“Wànwù yǐ bèi wéi yīn, yǐ fù wéi yáng”* (万物以背为阴，以腹为阳). The *Hànshū Gāodì Jì Zhù* (汉书高帝纪注) cites it as *“xiàng yīn ér bào yáng”* (向阴而负阳).\n\nThe *Lièzǐ Tiānruì Piān* (列子天瑞篇) states: *“Chōng hé qì zhě wéi rén”* (冲和气者为人). The *Huángdì Nèijīng Tàisū Juàn shíjiǔ Zhīzhēnshí Piān Yángshàngshàn Zhù* (黄帝内经太素卷十九知针石篇杨上善注) states: *“Wànwù bào yīn bào yáng, chōng qì yǐ wéi hé, wànwù jìn cóng sān qì ér shēng, gù rén zhī xíng bù lí yīnyáng yě”* (万物负阴抱阳，冲气以为和，万物尽从三气而生，故人之形不离阴阳也). These words all derive from here.\n\n*“Bào”* (抱) is written as *“bào”* (袌) in the *Fù* (傅) version.\n\n「Chōng」 (冲), as rendered by Fàn Yìngyuán (范应元) and Gāo Xiè (高翿), is written as **«zhōng»** (盅); the character **«qì»** (气) is absent in Zhāng Suìchéng’s (张嗣成) version.\n\nWhat people detest are solitude, widowhood, and poverty*—* yet kings and nobles take them as titles.\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: *“Bù guǒ”* (不毂) is annotated in the *Gùzhù* (御注) and by Wáng Bì (王弼) as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷).\nWèi Jiàosūn (魏稼孙) remarks: *“Wéi wánggōng wéi chēng”* (而王公以为称) reverses the order of the characters in the *Gùzhù* (御注).\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Dūnhuáng jǐběn* (敦煌己本) reads *“wéi chēng”* (为称) as *“zì míng”* (自名).\nIn my annotation: The *Fù* (傅) version reads *“wánghóu yǐ zì chēng yě”* (王侯以自称也), while the *Fàn* (范) version has *“wánghóu yǐ zì wèi yě”* (王侯以自谓也).\nFàn (范) says: *“Wáng Bì (王弼) and Yán Zūn (严遵) follow the ancient text, while Héshàng Gōng (河上公) renders it as ‘而王公以为称’ (wéi wánggōng wéi chēng). Now, we follow the ancient text.”*\nAccording to today’s *Yílán Táng* (怡兰堂) and *Dàozàng* (道藏) editions of the *Yán* (严) version, they both read *“wéi wánggōng yǐ míngchēng”* (而王公以名称), differing from Fàn’s (范) observation.\nLáo Jiàn (劳健) states: *“Wéi wánggōng wéi chēng”* (而王公以为称) is the reading in all Tang-era editions and the *Héshàng* (河上) version. Here, *“wánggōng”* (王公) is used for its rhyme with *“chēng”* (称), just as in Chapter 32 *“hóu”* (侯) rhymes with *“shǒu”* (守), and in Chapter 39 *“wáng”* (王) rhymes with *“zhēn”* (贞) and *“chēng”* (称). Thus, it should follow the Tang-era editions.\nIn my annotation: Following the Tang-era edition is correct; *“gōng”* (公) and *“chēng”* (称) do not rhyme.\n\nTherefore, some things are diminished when increased, and some are increased when diminished.\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: *“Yì zhī ér sǔn”* (益之而损) lacks the *“yòu”* (或) in the *Gùzhù* (御注).\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Gùzhù* (御注) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) versions also lack *“yòu”* (或).\nIn my annotation: The *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gǔ Huān* (顾欢), *Péng Zhì* (彭耜), and *Gāo Xiè* (高翿) versions likewise lack the *“yòu”* (或) below, while the *Yán Zūn* (严遵) version omits both *“yòu”* (或) and the first three characters.\n\nWhat people are taught, I also teach:---\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Gùzhù* (御注) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) versions both read *“yì wǒ yì jiào zhī”* (亦我义教之).\nIn my annotation: Xíng Xuán (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Péng Zhì* (彭耜), Zhào (赵), and *Gāo* (高) versions align with the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version. The *Shìtōng* (室町) version reads *“rén zhī suǒ jiào, wǒ yì jiào rén”* (人之所教，我亦教人).\nSūn Shèng’s (孙盛) *Lǎozi Yíwèn Fǎnxùn* (老子疑问反讯) quotes *“yì”* (亦) with an *“yǐ”* (以) character below.\nThe *Fù* (傅) version reads *“rén zhī suǒ jiào wǒ, yì wǒ zhī suǒ jiào rén”* (人之所教我，亦我之所教人), while the *Fàn* (范) version has *“yì”* (亦) preceded by *“ér”* (而).\nFàn (范) states: *“Wáng Bì (王弼) and Yán Zūn (严遵) follow the ancient text, while Héshàng Gōng (河上公) renders it as ‘人之所教，亦我义教之’ (rén zhī suǒ jiào, yì wǒ yì jiào zhī).”*\nIn my annotation: The current *Yán* (严) version reads *“rén zhī suǒ jiào, yì wǒ jiào zhī”* (人之所教，亦我教之), differing from Fàn’s (范) observation.

There is no mention of *«wúyǒu rù yú wúwén»* (无有入于无闻).\n\nYán Kějūn said: The *Yùzhù* (御注), *Héshàng* (河上), and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions lack *«yú»* (于), while *Fù Yì* (傅奕) and *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) read: *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn”* (出于无有，入于无间).\n\nWèi Jiàosūn said: *«Wúwén»* (无闻) likely stems from a mistake in the inscription. *«Wén»* (闻) is a misinterpretation of *«jiàn»* (间); Yán Kějūn erred in this correction.\n\nJiāo Jǒng said: The ancient *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) versions uniformly read: *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn”* (出于无有，入于无间).\n\nFàn Yìngyuán said: *«Jiàn»* (间) means *«xì»* (隙, gap). *Fù Yì* (傅奕) and *Yán Zūn* (严遵) align with the ancient editions.\n\nIt is noted that the current *Yán* (严) version reads: *“Wúyǒu rù yú wújiàn”* (无有入于无间).\n\nLiú Shīpéi said: The *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) *Yuándào* (原道) and *Yuántuàn* (原训) cite: *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn,”* which reflects the ancient *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text. The *Wáng* (王) version also includes *«chū yú»* (出于) twice. In *Wáng Bì*’s (王弼) preceding annotation, *“Qì wú suǒ bù rù, shuǐ wú suǒ bù chū yú jīng”* (气无所不入，水无所不出于经), the phrase *«wú suǒ bù chū yú jīng»* (无所不出于经) should read *«wú suǒ bù jīng»* (无所不经), paralleling *«wú suǒ bù rù»* (无所不入). The *«chū yú»* (出于) must belong to the main text above *«wúyǒu»* (无有). It appears the *Wáng* (王) version also reads *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn,”* with *«chū yú»* (出于) mistakenly placed in the annotation.\n\n*Fù Yì* (傅奕) aligns with *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子).\n\nLiú Wéntiǎn said: The current *Lǎozǐ* (老子) *Héshànggōng Zhāngjù* (河上公章句) *“Biān yòng dì sìshí sān zhāng”* (偏用第四十三) reads: *“Tiānxià zhī zhì róu, chěngcèng tiānxià zhī zhì jiān, wúyǒu rù wújiàn,”* with *«chū»* (出) omitted before *«wúyǒu»* (无有). This can be supplemented based on the *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) citation. The *Dàoyìng* (道应) passage cites *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn,”* likely altered by later scholars.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) annotation states: *“Wúyǒu, wèi Dào yě. Dào wú xíngzhì, suǒnéng chū rù wújiàn.”* (无有，谓道也。道无形质，故能出入无间.) This suggests the version he consulted still lacked *«chū»* (出).\n\nWáng Dào said: *«Wújiàn»* (无间) means *«wúxì»* (无隙, no gap). A single *zhàng* (丈) of water can float a ten-thousand *hú* (斛) vessel; a six *chǐ* (尺) rein can guide a thousand-*lǐ* (里) horse. The utmost gentleness riding the utmost firmness—this is the case. The *qi* (气) of Heaven and Earth, though formless, can penetrate metal and stone; the light of the sun and moon, though without substance, can pierce through lattice windows. *«Wúyǒu rù yú wújiàn»* (无有入于无间)—this is the case. Thus, one knows the virtue/power of *wuwei* (无为).\n\nYán Kějūn said: The *Yùzhù* (御注) reads *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì yì,”* while *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) include *«zhī»* (之), omitting the repeated *«yì»* (益).\n\nWèi Jiàosūn said: Yán Kějūn incorrectly noted the *«zhī»* (之) and *«yì»* (益) in *Yùzhù* (御注), missing *«wú»* (吾) above *«shì»* (是).\n\nLuó Zhèn-yù said: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) versions lack *«wú»* (吾) and *«zhī»* (之).\n\n**Qiánzhī’s annotation:** All *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions read *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì,”* with *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Shìmíng* (室町), and *Fàn* (范) versions identical, *«wú»* (无) rendered as *«wú»* (无). *Gù Huān* (顾欢) reads *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi yǒuyì,”* while Péng Zhì renders *“Shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì yě.”*\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid, the virtue/power of *wuwei* (无为), few in the world can attain.\n\n**Qiánzhī’s annotation:** The *Fù* (傅) version renders *«xī»* (希) as *«xǐ»* (稀), with *«yǐ»* (矣) appended below. The *Fàn* (范) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) versions render *«wú»* (无) as *«wú»* (无). This reflects the meaning of Chapter 70: *“Wú yán shèn yì zhī, shèn yì xíng; tiānxià mò néng zhī, mò néng xíng.”* (吾言甚易知，甚易行；天下莫能知，莫能行.)\n\n**[Sound and Rhyme]** According to Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme scheme, this chapter lacks rhyme.\n\nGāo Běn Hàn and Xí Dòng noted *«jiān»* (坚) and *«jiàn»* (间) as rhyming. *«Jiān»* (坚) belongs to the *Zhēn* (真) rhyme group, *«jiàn»* (间) to *Yuán* (元), indicating *Yuán-Zhēn* (元、真) rhyme interchange.\n\nXuè Huì said: *«Jiān»* (坚) is akin to *«gāngqiáng»* (刚强, strong), yet it is not called *«gāng»* (刚) or *«qiáng»* (强)—this is a variation in literary rhyme.\n\nThe *Yòujǐnglóng Bēi* (右景龙碑) contains 38 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version 37, the *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions 39, the *Fù* (傅) version 44, and the *Fàn* (范) version 42.\n\nThe *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *“Biàn yòng dì sìshísān zhāng”* (遍用第四十三), the *Wáng* (王) version *“Sìshísān zhāng”* (四十三章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *“Tiānxià zhī zhì róu zhāng dì sìshísān”* (天下之至柔章第四十三).\n\n**Chapter 44**\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWho is dearer—name or self?

Here, it aligns with the '重' in '重迭' (重迭, overlapping), and can be extended to mean '重' (重) in '轻重' (轻重, weighty/light). The Hànshū (汉书) *Biàn Bù* (黥布) passage says: '又多其材' (又多其材, moreover, his talents were abundant), where Shǐ Gǔ (师古) annotates: '多 means repeated/weighty'.\"*\n\nThus, excessive love incurs great expenditure, and excessive accumulation invites heavy loss.\nYáo Wéndiàn divides *«zhú»* (足) and *«rǔ»* (辱) as one rhyme (六屋入声), *«zhǐ»* (止) and *«dài»* (殆) and *«jiǔ»* (久) as another (四之上声).\n\nDèng Tíngzhēn states: *\"The character '久' lacks a rhyme; he notes that the preceding seven sentences all exhibit internal rhyme within their five- or four-character lines, akin to the poetic structure of '于嗟乎驺虞' (于嗟乎驺虞) or '日居月诸' (日居月诸).\"*\nJiāng Yǒuguì says: *\"「货」 is pronounced *huò* (呼卧切).

It should be read as *píyáng* (皮羊切) in its ancient tone and classified under the *Yáng* (阳) rhyme group.\"*\nThe *Lìjiè* (立戒) passage of the *Lǎozǐ* (老子) reads: *\"「得与亡孰病」\"* (得与亡孰病) with *«wáng»* (亡) and *«bìng»* (病) as internal rhyme (forty-third *yìng* (映)).\n\nThe *Gǔrényìn* (古韵总论) states: *\"In antiquity, there were instances where the rhyme shifted within a single sentence, as in the seven sentences of this chapter and the four sentences of '我无为而民自化' (我无为而民自化).\"*\nMǎ Xùlún, in the *Máopǐ zhèngyùn* (毛诗正韵) postscript, cites this chapter: *\"身、亲、货、多、亡、病、爱、费、藏、亡、足、辱、止、殆、久\"* (身、亲、货、多、亡、病、爱、费、藏、亡、足、辱、止、殆、久) all exhibit internal rhyme.\n\nThe *Yòujǐnglóng* (右景龙) version contains 40 characters; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version matches. The *Héshàng* (河上) version has 37 characters, while the *Wáng* (王), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) versions each have 39 characters.\nThe *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *\"Lìjiè dì sìshísì\"* (立戒第四十四), the *Wáng* (王) version *\"Sìshísì zhāng\"* (四十四章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *\"Míng yǔ shēn shú qīn zhāng dì sìshísì\"* (名与身孰亲章第四十四章).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 45**\nWhen the Great Dao is complete, its use is inexhaustible.\n\nQián Zhī annotates: *«鈌»* (鈌) is rendered *«quē»* (缺) in other versions; the *Yìlín* (意林) volume one, the scripture, and the *Héshànggōng* (河上公) annotations all read *«鈌»* (鈌), while the Song-printed *Héshàng* (河上) version renders *«鈌»* (鈌).\nMǎ Xùlún states: *\"「鈌」 and 「鈌」 are both corrupt forms of 「缺」 (缺). In Six Dynasties vernacular texts, the radical for '缶' (fū) and '垂' (chuí) was often confused. '缶' was mistakenly written as '○', and then further misread as '金' (jīn).\"*\n*«Bì»* (弊) is rendered *«bì»* (敝) in the versions of Fù Yì (傅奕), Péng (彭), Zhào (赵), and the *Hánshī wàichuán* (韩诗外传) volume nine.\nThe *Yùnhuì xiǎobǔ* (韵会小补) states: *\"「敝」 is pronounced *bì* (笔别切), as in the *Lǎozǐ* (老子) passage.\"*\nThis aligns with the *suǒjiàn* (所见) version of Yáo Wéndiàn (姚文田).\nBì Qián (毕沅) states: *\"「敝」 is rendered '○' by *Héshànggōng* (河上公) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼).\"*\nThis aligns with the *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions as seen by Bì (毕). Now, all *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions render *«bì»* (弊), matching this stone.\n\nThe Great fullness, like overflowing, its use is never-ending.\nQián Zhī annotates: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) versions, as well as the *Wénxuǎn* (文选) *Wèidū* (魏都) annotations, *Zèng Lùjī* (赠陆机) as *Wúwáng* (吴王) *Lángzhōnglìng* (郎中令) poem annotations, and *Yīqièjīng yìnyì* (一切经音义) volume five all render *«yíng»* (盈) as *«mǎn»* (满).\n\n「傅、范」 versions render *«chōng»* (冲) as *«zhōng»* (盅).\nFàn Yìngyuán (范应元) states: *\"「大满若盅」 (大盈若冲), Guō Yún (郭云) and Wáng Bì (王弼) align with the ancient texts.\"* This confirms that the Wáng (王) version seen by Fàn (范) also renders it as *«mǎn»* (满).\nAs annotated, the correct rendering is *«yíng»* (盈).\nThe character *«mǎn»* (满) was altered to avoid the taboo of Emperor Huì of Hàn (汉惠帝讳).\nAll other versions render it as *«yíng»* (盈), and *«yíng»* (盈) is the original text (Mǎ Xùlún [马叙伦] says).\n*«Chōng»* (冲), following the Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) versions, should be rendered as *«zhōng»* (盅).\nIt is also written as *«chōng»* (冲).\nThe *Chūnqiū Fàn* (准南原道) states: *\"Chōng while xū yíng\"* (冲而徐盈), with the annotation: *\"Empty.\"* This *«dàyíng ruò chōng»* (大盈若冲) is thus *«dàyíng ruò xū»* (大盈若虚).\nAdditionally, *«dàyíng»* (大盈) corresponds with *«dàchéng»* (大成) from above, where *«chéng»* (成) is the abbreviated form of *«shèng»* (盛).\nShèng (盛) and yíng (盈) both derive from *«mǐn»* (皿), referring to ancient vessels used for food and drink.\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states: *\"「chéng」 (成) is the abbreviated form of 「shèng」 (盛).\"* The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) says: *\"Shèng (盛), to fill the millet and sorghum in vessels for sacrificial offerings.\"* This is extended to mean vessels as shèng (盛), as seen in *Tàishǐ Gōngshì Dàntán* (太史公司马谈) *Dàjì* (大记): *\"Shí zhōu yú shèng\"* (食粥于盛).\nIn this passage, *«shèng»* (盛) and *«quē»* (缺) are paired.\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: *\"Quē (缺), a broken vessel.\"* (缺, 器破也.)\nAs annotated, *«yíng»* (盈) also refers to vessels.\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) says: *\"○ (盈), a full vessel, from皿○ (mǐn盈).\"* This is extended to mean *«full and stored»* as yíng (盈).\n*«Dàyíng ruò chōng»* (大盈若冲), *«chōng»* (冲) should be rendered as *«zhōng»* (盅).\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字), under the *«mǐn»* (皿) section, states: *\"○ (盅), an empty vessel, from皿○ (mǐn盅), with the middle tone.\"* Lǎozǐ (老子) says: *\"Dào zhōng ér yòng zhī\"* (道盅而用之).\nEmpty vessels correspond to full vessels, illustrating that vessels of great fullness are like those emptied—thus, their use is never-ending.\n\n**Great straightness is like bending,**\nAs annotated, all *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions agree, while Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) render *«qū»* (屈) as *«qū»* (诎).\nLuó Juǎn (罗振玉) mistakenly renders *«zhí»* (直) as *«zhēn»* (真).\nFàn Yìngyuán (范应元) states: *\"Qū\"* (诎) is pronounced like *«qū»* (屈), meaning to bend or curve.\nTàishǐ Gōngshì (太史公司马) aligns with the ancient texts.\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states: All versions, as well as annotations from *Huáinán Dàoyīng Juàn* (淮南道应训) and *Hòushǐ Xuànshuō Zhì* (后汉书荀爽传注), render it as *«qū»* (屈).\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) says:\n*\"Qū (屈), without a tail.\"* (屈, 无尾也.)\n*\"Qū (诎), to question and bend.\"* (诎, 诘诎也.)\n*\"Yǐ (颉), head bent.\"* (颉, 头颉也.)\n*\"○ (蛣), to bend.\"* (蛣○, 蛣○也.)\nThus, *«qū»* (诎) conveys the meaning of bending or curving.\nAncient texts often use *«qū»* (诎) in the phrase *«qūshēn»* (屈申).\nIt is further annotated that the following sentence should include *«qí yòng bù qū»* (其用不屈).\nSūn Yǐràng (孙诒让) states: In *Hánshī Wàichuán* (韩诗外传) volume nine, the citation of Lǎozǐ (老子) renders *«qū»* (屈) as *«qū»* (诎), matching the Fù (傅) version.\nThe phrase *«dàqiǎo ruò zhuō»* (大巧若拙) follows *«dàbiàn ruò nè»* (大辩若讷), and there should be *«qí yòng bù qū»* (其用不屈) beneath it.\nFollowing the parallel structure of the previous sentences *«qí yòng bù bì»* (其用不弊) and *«qí yòng bù qióng»* (其用不穷), this confirms the presence of the omitted phrase.\nHán (韩) relies on texts from the *Xiānqín* (先秦) and *Xīhàn* (西汉) periods, hence its completeness.\nAll versions from *Wèi* (魏) and *Jìn* (晋) onward omit this sentence.\n\n**Great skill is like clumsiness,**\n**Great eloquence is like stammering.**\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: *«Nè»* (讷) is rendered *«náo»* (吶) in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version.\nAs annotated, Lǐ Dàochún (李道纯) and Lóu Zhèng (楼正) versions render *«biàn»* (辩) as *«biàn»* (辨).\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) passage in *Qùqiè* (胠箧) and *Huáinán Dàoyīng Juàn* (淮南道应训) both cite the same.\n*Hánshī Wàichuán* (韩诗外传) volume nine renders it as: *«Dàbiàn ruò nè, dàqiǎo ruò zhuō, qí yòng bù qū»* (大辩若讷, 大巧若拙, 其用不屈), while *Móuzǐ Lǐhuò Lùn* (牟子理惑论) renders it as: *«Dàbiàn ruò nè, dàqiǎo ruò zhuō»* (大辩若讷, 大巧若拙), inverting the order of the two phrases.\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) suggests that in *Dàchéng Ruò Quē* (大成若缺) of *Dàodé Zhǐguī Lùn* (道德指归论), the phrase *«dàqiǎo ruò zhuō»* (大巧若拙) is followed by *«yíng ér ruò qū»* (赢而若诎), indicating that the version he consulted may have included *«dàyíng ruò qū»* (大赢若诎) but lacked *«dàbiàn ruò nè»* (大辩若讷).\n\n**Agitation overcomes cold,**\n**Calmness overcomes heat.**\n\nWèi Jiàosūn (魏稼孙) states: *«Zào shèng sāi»* (躁胜塞) should have *«sāi»* (塞) rendered as *«hán»* (寒) in the annotation, as corrected by Yán Shī (严失).\nAs annotated, *«sāi»* (塞) is rendered *«hán»* (寒) in all versions; this is a mistaken character.\n*«Jìng»* (静) is rendered *«jìng»* (靖) in the Fù (傅) version, and similarly below.\nAdditionally, the character *«zào»* (躁), Mǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states: *\"「Zào」 (躁), the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文) renders as 「zào」 (躁), meaning swiftness; it is now commonly written as 「zào」 (躁).\"* Here, it should be rendered as *«zào»* (燥).\nAs annotated, Mǎ (马) is correct.\nThe *Shīmíng* (释名) states: *\"Zào (躁), dryness; things dry and move, flying and scattering.\"* (躁, 燥也, 物燥乃动而飞扬也.)\nThe *Shīyán Yǔ* (释言语) states: *\"Zào (燥), scorched.\"* (燥, 焦也.)\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: *\"Zào (燥), dry.\"* (燥, 干也.)\nYán Zūn (严遵) in *Dàodé Zhǐguī Lùn* (道德指归论) *Dàchéng Ruò Quē* (大成若缺) says:\n*\"Thus, when yīn (阴) reaches its peak, the earth cracks and ice solidifies, cold winds blow fiercely, frost and snow congeal rigidly, fish and turtles hibernate, and all things curl up tightly.\nAt this time, even a single warm room, facing a furnace, layered with fox and badger skins, wrapped in fluffy wool, still cannot resist the cold.\nBut when one's spirit is settled and mind is at ease, when the body moves and exerts itself, then the essence flows and sweat pours, shedding clothes and stepping outside, warmth remains in excess on the body.\"*\n\n「Thus, the explanation of *zào* (躁) as *\"dòngtǐ láo xíng\"* (动体劳形) is insightful, yet it fails to account for the fact that even in a warm room, beside a furnace, layered with fox and badger skins, wrapped in fluffy wool, one still cannot resist the cold—this contradicts common experience. The error stems from interpreting *zào* (躁) as *zào* (燥) in the common sense.\n\nIn truth, *zào* (躁) is *zào* (燥), but *zào* (燥) is the楚方言 (Chu dialect) used in *Lǎozǐ*’s (老子) book, specifically referring to *furnace flames*. The *Shīyán Yǔ* (释言语) states: *\"The Chu (楚) call fire *zào* (燥), the Qi (齐) call it *huǐ* (毁), and the Wu (吴) call it *tāo* (焚).\"* Since *Lǎozǐ* (老子) was a Chu (楚) man, he used *zào* (躁). *\"Zào (躁) overcomes cold\"* is paired with *\"jìng (静) overcomes heat\"* (静胜热).\n\nThe character *jìng* (静) shares its meaning with *jìng* (寂). In the *Chūcí* (楚辞) *Lǚfén Shìwén* (汝坟释文), it is noted: *\"The Chu (楚) call stillness *jìng* (寂), and the Qi (齐) call it *jìng* (静).\"* The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: *\"寂 (jìng), from 水 (shuǐ, water), the sound of 静 (jìng).\"* This implies that clear, still water can overcome heat, while furnace flames can repel cold. The phrase *\"clearing and stillness as the Dao/Way (正) for all under heaven\"* (清静以为天下正) is found in the *Dàchéng Ruò Quē* (大成若缺) chapter, though some editions omit the *\"yǐ\"* (以) character. My examination shows that the editions of *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Shìmáng* (室町), *Gù Huān* (顾欢), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) all include *\"yǐ\"* (以). The *Fàn* (范) edition further adds *\"zhī\"* (知) before *\"qīng\"* (清), stating: *\"The ancient edition has the characters '知以' (zhī yǐ).\"* The term *\"qīngjìng\"* (清静) in *Yán Zūn*’s (严遵) text and in *Yáng Xióng*’s (扬雄) *Jiě Jiào* (解嘲) annotation aligns with *\"néng qīng néng jìng\"* (能清能静).\n\nThe *Shìjì* (史记) *Lǎozǐ Zhuàn* (老子传) states: *\"Lǐ Ěr (李耳) transforms himself through *wúwéi* (无为), and his *qīngjìng* (清静) brings *zhèng* (正) to himself.\"* This is an abbreviated passage. The *Chéngshū* (成疏) commentary explains: *\"Clear, still, and tranquil, one can benefit oneself and others, and correct what is deviant—thus, it is the Dao/Way (正) for all under heaven.\"* The *Dūnghuáng* (敦煌) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) editions, as well as the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition, read *\"zhèng\"* (正), not *\"zhèng\"* (政). *Wǔnèi* (武内) mistakenly corrected it to *\"zhèng\"* (政), claiming: *\"The Dūnghuáng (敦), Jǐngfú (景), and Suìzhōu (遂) editions all read '政' (zhèng).\"* *Jǐng Héshàng* (警河上) annotated: *\"If one can clear and still, then one becomes the eternal ruler for all under heaven.\"* Thus, *Héshàng* (河上) rendered it as *\"néng qīng néng jìng, wéi tiānxià zhèng\"* (能清能静，为天下正).\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) states:\n*\"Great completion resembles deficiency; its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness; its use is boundless.\"*\n\n【Rhymes and Tones】 In this chapter, *Jiāng Shì* (江氏) rhyme readings are as follows:\n- *Quē* (缺) and *Bì* (敝) rhyme (祭部, *bì* pronounced as *biě* (蹩)),\n- *Chōng* (冲) and *Qióng* (穷) rhyme (中部),\n- *Qū* (屈), *Zhuō* (拙), *Nè* (讷), and *Rè* (热) rhyme (脂、祭通韵, *qū* pronounced as *quē* (缺), *zhuō* co-rhyming with *zé* (棁), *nè* co-rhyming with *nǚ* (奴, as in *nuè* 月反)).\n\n- *Jìng* (静) and *Zhèng* (正) rhyme (耕部).\n\n*Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢) notes:\n- *Quē* (缺) and *Bì* (弊) rhyme, stating: *\"'弊' (bì) is in the 祭部 (zhài bù) rhyme category, while '缺' (quē) is its 入声 (rù shēng, entering tone).\"*\n\nMy examination shows that *Yáo Wéntián* (姚文田) aligns with *Jiāng* (江), while *Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢), *Gāo Běnhàn* (高本汉), *Xí Dòng* (奚侗), and *Chén Zhù* (陈柱) do not consider *\"rè\"* (热) as part of the rhyme scheme. *Lǐ Dàochún* (李道纯) suggests *\"bì\"* (弊) be co-rhymed as *\"biē\"* (鳖). *Gù Yànwǔ* (顾炎武) in his *Táng Yùn* (唐韵) *Zhèng Shíliù* (正十六屑) states that *\"quē\"* (缺) in the *去声 (qù shēng, departing tone)* is pronounced as *\"kǔhuì\"* (苦惠反), also written as *\"缺\"* (quē).\n\n「To the right, the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version has **forty-one characters**, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version and the *Héshàng* (河上) version have **forty characters**, while the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions have **forty-two characters**. The *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *\"Hóngdé dì sìshíwǔ\"* (洪德第四十五), the *Wáng* (王) version *\"Sìshíwǔ zhāng\"* (四十五章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *\"Dàchéng ruò quē zhāng sìshíwǔ\"* (大成若缺章第四十五).\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six:**\nWhen the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, the warhorses are turned back to till the fields;\nWhen the **Dao/Way** does not prevail in the world, warhorses are born in the suburbs.\n\n*Luó Zhènyù* (罗振玉) states: *\"Fèn\"* (粪), in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version, is written as *\"○\"*, a variant form of *\"fèn\"* (粪).*\n**My examination:** The stele version matches this.\n\n*Luó* (罗) mistakenly wrote *\"róng\"* (戎) as *\"wǒ\"* (我) in his notes—an error in verification.\n\n*\"Fèn\"* (粪), in the *Fù* (傅) version, is written as *\"bō\"* (播).\n*Bì Yàn* (毕沅) notes: *\"Fèn\"* (粪) and *\"bō\"* (播) are ancient characters used interchangeably.*\nThe *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) defines: *\"Bō\"* (播) means *to sow*.\nPerhaps the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) here carries the meaning of *sowing*.\n\n*Péng Zhé* (彭耜) states: *\"Zhū Wén Gōng\"* (朱文公) version has *\"chē\"* (车) after *\"fèn\"* (粪), suggesting that the warhorses are turned back to clear the dung from the fields.\nRecently, in Jiangxi, I saw what is called a *fèn chē* (粪车), and only then did I understand this.\n\n*Wú Chéng* (吴澄) states: *\"Fèn\"* (粪) under has no *\"chē\"* (车) in other versions, only in *Zhūzǐ* (朱子) *Lùjì* (语录) is it mentioned, yet no one knows its source.\nNow, examining *Zhāng Héng* (张衡) *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋), it reads *\"却走马以粪车\"* (turn back the warhorses to clear the dung from the fields), which uses the full phrase of the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经). Yet by the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the *\"chē\"* (车) character was already missing, and *Wèi* (魏) scholar *Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s annotation, though not far from *Zhāng Héng* (张衡), already omitted it.\nIt seems that initially, one character was accidentally dropped, and later scholars, unaware of the error, did not restore it.\n*\"Chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) rhyme, but omitting *\"chē\"* (车) leaves no rhyme.\n**My examination:** *\"Chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) do not rhyme; further explanation follows below.\n\n*Yì Shùndǐng* (易顺鼎) states: According to *Wénzǐ* (文子) *Jīngchéng piān* (精诚篇), it says:\n*\"Only those who travel at night can achieve this, hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields, and the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\n\nSome read *\"chē\"* (车) as connected to the previous sentence, which also supports *Wú Chéng* (吴澄)'s interpretation.\nHowever, the *Huáinán Lǎn* (淮南览) *Míngxùn* (冥训) states:\n*\"Hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields, and the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\nHere, *\"fèn\"* (粪) is followed by *\"ér\"* (而), so *\"chēguǐ\"* (车轨) should be read as a connected phrase.\n\n*Gāo* (高)'s annotation states:\n*\"'却走马以粪' (turn back the warhorses to till the fields) is a phrase from the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经). It means stopping the warhorses from running and using them to till the fields instead.\nAnother interpretation: When a ruler lacks **virtue/power**, warhorses are born in the suburbs, and the warhorses are used to till the fields, hence the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\n\nIn the *Huáinán Lǎn* (淮南览), there are annotations by *Xǔ Shèng* (许慎) and *Gāo Yòu* (高诱). This second interpretation is likely *Xǔ Shèng* (许慎)'s, yet it aligns with *Gāo* (高)'s meaning.\nThe annotation by *Xuē Jiōng* (薛综) in *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋) also cites the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) phrase *\"却走马以粪\"* (turn back the warhorses to till the fields), indicating that by the end of the Han Dynasty, those transmitting the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) had no *\"chē\"* (车) character, and *Zhāng Héng* (张衡) likely misread *Wénzǐ* (文子)!\n*Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s *\"yǐ fèn tián\"* (以粪田) correctly uses the original meaning.\nThe pronunciation of *\"chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) also does not align closely, and *Wú* (吴) assumes they rhyme, which is unclear.\n\nAgain, according to *Wénzǐ* (文子) *Zìrán piān* (自然篇), it states:\n*\"The footprints do not reach the borders of the neighboring states, and the chariot tracks do not extend beyond a thousand miles.\"*\nThis clearly shows *\"chēguǐ\"* (车轨) as a connected phrase.\n*He Shìzhào* (何氏焯) *Dúshū jì* (读书记) cites *Wénzǐ* (文子) as *\"fèn chē\"* (粪车), but *Lǐ* (李)'s annotation missed this and is incorrect.\n**My examination:** The annotations by *Zhāng Jǐngyáng* (张景阳) *Qī Mìng zhù* (七命注) cite *Wáng Bì* (王弼) as saying:\n*\"When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, cultivation of the fields is all that is needed, hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields.\"*\nThe annotation by *Yán Shìgǔ* (颜师古) in *Hànshū* (汉书) *Xīyù zhuàn* (西域传) states:\n*\"The *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) says: 'When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, the warhorses are turned back to till the fields.'\"*\nIt is likely that *\"fèn\"* (粪) either has *\"wéi\"* (为) above it or *\"tián\"* (田) below it, or else it is a mistaken citation identical to *\"fèn chē\"* (粪车).\n\nThe *Hánfēi* (韩非) *Jiě Lǎozǐ* (解老) and *Yù Lǎozǐ* (喻老) both cite the same text as this stele.\nAdditionally, according to the *Yánsī Lùn* (盐铁论) *Wèitōng piān* (未通篇), it states:\n*\"At that time, the warhorses were turned back to till the fields. Later, military expeditions were frequently launched, and the warhorses were insufficient, so even the mares were sent into battle, hence the foals were born on the battlefield.\"*\n\nThis interpretation refers to the scarcity of warhorses in the army, where even mares were sent into battle, aligning with the ancient meaning of the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经).\n\n**The greatest crime is to desire what is not right;**\n**The greatest calamity is to not know contentment;**\n**The greatest misfortune is to covet what one desires.**\n\n*Yán Kějūn* (严可均) notes: *\"The greatest misfortune is to covet what one desires\"* is absent in *Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s version.\n*Luó Zhènyù* (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yùzhù* (御注), *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), and *Jǐngfú* (景福) versions all have the sentence *\"The greatest crime is to desire what is not right\"*, and the *Shìwén* (释文) *Héshàng* (河上) version also includes it.\nThe character *\"dà\"* (大) in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version is written as *\"shèn\"* (甚).\n\n**My examination:** The *Guāngmíng* (广明), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Nǎi juàn* (柰卷), *Shìcháng* (室町), *Gāo* (高), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) versions all match this stele.\nOnly the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions have the third sentence as *\"Guì mò cǎn yú yù dé\"* (咎莫憯于欲得), while the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) and *Gù Huān* (顾欢) versions write *\"dà\"* (大) as *\"shèn\"* (甚).\nThe *Hánshī wàizhuàn* (韩诗外传) *Jiǔ* (九) cites the first sentence *\"kě yù\"* (可欲) as *\"duō yù\"* (多欲), and *Wú Chéng* (吴澄)'s version places the third sentence above the second.\n\nThe *\"○\"* is a variant form of *\"jiù\"* (咎), identical to the ninth chapter.\n*Yú Yì* (俞樾) states: According to the *Héshàng* (河上) version, there is a sentence *\"The greatest crime is to desire what is not right\"* above this one, and based on the *Hánfēi zǐ* (韩非子) *Jiě Lǎo piān* (解老篇), this sentence should exist.\nHowever, *Hánfēi zǐ* (韩非子) mistakenly writes *\"huò mò dà yú kě yù\"* (祸莫大于可欲), which is incorrect.\nThe preceding text states:\n*\"He who harms the weak ruler above and oppresses the people below commits the greatest crime.\"*\nThus, it is clear that the original character was *\"zuì\"* (罪).」\n\nLiu Shipei says: *\"Yú’s account is correct. In the *Hánfēi zǐ* *Jiě Lǎo piān* (解老篇), the character ‘祸’ (huò) was mistakenly influenced by the preceding ‘君祸’ (jūn huò). Moreover, the *Yù Lǎo piān* (喻老篇) also cites these three phrases, correctly rendering them as ‘罪莫大于可欲’ (zuì mò dà yú kě yù). Given the preceding context—‘To name and title as crime, to give cities and lands as crime’—it is evident that the original *Lǎozi* text must have read ‘罪’ (zuì).*\n\nHowever, in both the *Jiě Lǎo* and *Yù Lǎo* chapters of the *Hánfēi zǐ*, the phrase appears as ‘咎莫大于欲得’ (jiù mò dà yú yù dé), where ‘大’ (dà) is uniformly rendered as ‘憯’ (cǎn). In the *Jiě Lǎo piān*, ‘得’ (dé) is further mistakenly written as ‘利’ (lì). The preceding passage in the *Jiě Lǎo piān* reads: ‘When bitter suffering mixes within the intestines, it harms the person—this is *憯* (cǎn), and *憯* leads one to retreat and blame oneself,’ thus explaining the meaning of ‘憯.’ Since ‘憯’ (cǎn) is synonymous with ‘痛’ (tòng), it may be glossed as ‘祸莫痛于欲得’ (huò mò tòng yú yù dé). The ancient *Lǎozi* text must originally have read ‘憯’ (cǎn), as did the *Fù* (傅) edition. The current text renders it as ‘大’ (dà), likely due to later scholars harmonizing it with the preceding ‘大’ (dà) character.\n\nAs for the *Jiě Lǎo piān*’s substitution of ‘利’ (lì) for ‘得’ (dé), this was an error influenced by the preceding ‘欲利’ (yù lì). Gu Qianli’s correction—retaining ‘得’ (dé)—is accurate.\n\nIn my notes: The rendering of ‘大’ (dà) as ‘憯’ (cǎn) is correct. ‘憯’ (cǎn) is interchangeable with ‘甚’ (shèn). The *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) editions read ‘甚’ (shèn), while the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions read ‘憯’ (cǎn). Fàn (范) explains: ‘憯 (cǎn) is pronounced like *cǎn* (惨), meaning *pain*.’ Bì Yàn (毕沅) states: ‘The *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) editions also render ‘憯’ (cǎn) as ‘大’ (dà), while *Hánfēi zǐ* reads ‘咎莫憯于欲利’ (jiù mò cǎn yú yù lì), and Lǐ Yuē (李约) renders ‘憯’ (cǎn) as ‘甚’ (shèn). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines ‘憯’ (cǎn) as *pain*, and its ancient pronunciation aligns with ‘甚’ (shèn).’*\n\n「Mǎ Xùlún said: Chéng Shū (成疏) and Luó Juàn (罗卷) render it as *‘shèn’* (甚).\nChéng Shū (成疏) states: *“Its guilt and censure are none more severe than this.”*\nThus, Chéng (成) also uses *‘shèn’* (甚).\n*‘Shèn’* (甚) is borrowed for *‘cǎn’* (憯), as they belong to the same phonetic category.\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) notes: *“Replicated characters (○) are written as (○),”* serving as its precedent.\n\nHence, it is known that *“knowing sufficiency as sufficiency”* (知足之足) means *“sufficient”* (常足).\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) said: *“常足”* (常足) is rendered as *“常足矣”* (常足矣) in the *Yùzhù* (御注) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) editions.\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) noted: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) text lacks the *“故”* (故) and *“矣”* (矣) characters.\nMy annotation: The *Yán Zūn* (严遵) edition also lacks *“故”* (故), while the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition lacks *“矣”* (矣), though *Hánfēi wàishuān* (韩诗外传) includes them.\n\nThe *Sīmǎ Guāng* (司马光) edition omits *“之足”* (之足).\n*Hánfēi yù Lǎo* (韩非喻老) cites *“knowing sufficiency as sufficiency”* (知足之为足矣), while the *Wénxuǎn* (文选) *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋) annotation cites *“knowing sufficiency is sufficiency”* (知足常足).\nMy annotation: The character *“足”* (zú) derives from *“止”* (zhǐ), thus its meaning is *“to stop”* (止).\nThe *Yì* (易) states *“鼎折足”* (dǐng zhé zú, \"the tripod's leg broken\"), with *Zhèng Zhù* (郑注) explaining: *“‘趾’ (zhǐ) means ‘no matter’ (无事), while ‘足’ (zú) means ‘to set up’ (陈设).”*\nThe *Hànshū* (汉书) *Wǔxíng zhì* (五行志) states: *“‘足’ (zú) means ‘to stop’ (止).”*\nChapter 28 *“常德乃足”* (cháng dé nǎi zú, \"constant virtue is indeed sufficiency\"), with *Héshàng* (河上) annotation: *“‘to stop’ (止).”*\nLiú Xiànruò (刘咸炘) said: *“Knowing stop is knowing reversal”* (知止即知反).\nThe *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) repeatedly speaks of *“knowing sufficiency”* (知足), which is *“knowing stop”* (知止), meaning *“to preserve wealth and honor”* (保富贵).\n“Constant exchange” (相对往来) cannot endure long, for it must reverse to become constant and thus last.\n\nConstant endurance (常久) is indeed the core principle of Lǎozi (老子).\n【Phonology】Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme reading lacks a rhyme.\nYáo Wéntián (姚文田) states: *“欲”* (yù, “desire”) and *“足”* (zú, “sufficiency”) rhyme (六屋入声).\nDèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) and Xí Zòng (奚侗) agree.\nGāo Běnhàn (高本汉) and Chén Zhù (陈柱) say: *“欲”* (yù), *“足”* (zú), *“得”* (dé, “obtain”) and *“足”* (zú) rhyme.\nMy annotation: Wú Chéng (吴澄) remarked: *“‘粪’ (fèn, ‘dung’)” below has the character *“车”* (chē, ‘cart’), with *“车”* (chē, *yú* department) and *“郊”* (jiāo, *xiāo* department) rhyming.*\nThe *Yì* (易) *Shùn Dǐng* (顺鼎) states that *“车”* (chē) and *“郊”* (jiāo) are not close in sound, which is correct.\nWèi Yuán (魏源) in *Lǎozi běnyì* (老子本义) said: *“The three lines ‘静胜寒’ (jìng shèng hán, ‘tranquility overcomes cold’), some say should belong to the next chapter, as ‘正’ (zhèng, ‘upright’) and ‘粪’ (fèn, ‘dung’) form a rhyme, while ‘有道’ (yǒu dào, ‘with the Dao’) and ‘却走马’ (què zǒu mǎ, ‘turns back the horse’) illustrate the effect of ‘clearing and tranquility governing the world’ (清静治天下).*\nI tentatively retain this doubt.\nMy annotation: *“正”* (zhèng) and *“粪”* (fèn) indeed rhyme, but this is something I have not yet fully understood.»\n\nThis chapter rhymes *Dao* (道) and *jiāo* (郊).\n*Dao* (道) belongs to the *yōu* (幽) department, *jiāo* (郊) to the *xiāo* (霄) department—this is the same *yōu-xiāo* rhyming pattern as in the forty-seventh chapter, where *xiào* (笑) and *dào* (道) rhyme.\n\nWú Shēn (吴棫) in his *Yùn Bǔ* (韵补) under the *yù* (屋) rhyme (one *yù* department): *“dé”* (得) rhymes with *“shī”* (失).\n\nThe *Lǎozi* (老子) states:\n*“Zui mò dà yú kě yù, huò mò dà yú yù dé.”*\n(*“The greatest crime is to indulge in desires,\nThe greatest calamity is to covet what one desires.”*)\n\nThe *Yì Lín* (易林) says:\n*“Rù shì qiú lù, bù jiàn tóu zú;\nZhōng rì zhì yè, jìng wú suǒ dé.”*\n(*“Entering the market to

the small, hence *míng* (明)”*,\nboth use the paired terms ‘*jiàn* (见)’ and ‘*míng* (明)’.\nThis is further proof, and thus the character should be altered according to *Zhāng*’s (张) edition.”*\n\nNow, considering the *Shì Míng Shì Yán* (释名释言语):\n*“Míng (名): to make clear.”*\n*“Míng (名)” and *“míng (明)” share both sound and meaning,\nso there is no need to alter the character.\n\nAgain, *“bù wéi”* (不为),\nin *Héshàng* (河上) and *Yáo Mèngfǔ* (姚孟俯) editions,\nis written as *“wú wéi”* (无为).\nGiven the parallel structures *“bù xíng”* (不行) and *“bù jiàn”* (不见)\nin the preceding sentences, *“bù wéi”* (不为) is the correct form.\n\n---\n【Phonology and Rhyme】\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme readings for this chapter:\n*“Hù* (户), *xià* (下) rhyme (鱼部),\n*Yǒu* (牖), *dào* (道) rhyme (幽部).”*\n\nYáo Wéntián (姚文田)

agrees.\n\nXí Zōng (奚侗) reads:\n*“Yuǎn* (远), *wéi* (为) rhyme,\n*xíng* (行), *míng* (明), *chéng* (成) rhyme.”*\nIndeed, *“shǎo* (少)” was originally *“xiān* (鲜)”,\nand *“míng* (名)” was originally *“míng* (明)’.\nXí’s (奚) misreading alters *“bù xíng ér zhī”* (不行而知)\nto *“bù zhī ér xíng”* (不知而行),\nwhich is incorrect, as *“xíng* (行)” does not rhyme in this context.\n\nGù Yànwù (顾炎武) records the *Táng Yùn Zhèng* (唐韵正) Volume 93, Section 35, *Mǎ* (马):\n*“The ancient pronunciation of *xià* (下) is *hù* (户).”*\nIn *Lǎozi* (老子):\n*“Not stepping outside the door, knowing the world;\nCultivating it, its virtue becomes universal;\nA nine-tiered tower, rising from accumulated earth.”*\n\n「The journey of a thousand *lǐ* (里) begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThus, the Sage who wishes to elevate the people must first lower himself to their words, and he who wishes to lead them must first place himself behind them in conduct.\n\nThe adept in *shì* (士) does not resort to force, the skilled warrior does not rage, the master of defeating foes does not quarrel, and the wise ruler serves as their foundation.\n\nChén Dì (陈第) cites Wèi Liǎowēng (魏了翁):\n*\"In the *Liù Jīng* (六经), every instance of 下

The **Wáng Bìo** (王弼) text should also originally have contained them, as evidenced by his annotation:\n*\"Thus, those who speak do so according to their knowledge, those who act do so according to their ability; all the common people focus their ears and eyes upon it, and I merely nurture them in their simplicity.\"* (如此则言者言其所知，行者行其所能，百姓各皆注其耳目焉，吾皆孩之而已。)\n\nThe annotation further contains the four characters *\"each use their innate wisdom\"* (各用聪明), placed beneath the sentence *\"For the world, make it one with your heart\"* (为天下，浑其心), which correctly elucidates the meaning of *\"All the common people focus their ears and eyes upon it\"* (百姓皆注其耳目). Since the canonical text omits this sentence, it should be restored according to the **Héshànggōng** (河上公) edition.\n\nQián Zhī (谦之) notes:\nThe restoration as above is correct. All the **Wáng** (王) editions mistakenly omit this sentence, but the Daoist Canon **Wáng** (王) edition retains it.\n\nMoreover, *\"注\"* (zhu) means *\"to gather\"* (聚). The **Zhōu Lǐ** (周礼) commentary on *\"shòurén\"* (兽人) and the empty space *\"○\"* (○) in *\"tiánshù\"* (田疏) states:\n*\"注 means to gather.\"* (注犹聚也。) To *\"register\"* (注) their ears and eyes is to *\"gather\"* (聚) their ears and eyes.\n\nThe **Gù** (顾) edition’s commentary states:\n*\"Héshànggōng (河上公) renders it as ‘**注**’ (zhu), while other editions read ‘**浮**’ (fú). ‘浮’ implies stagnation and entanglement—those who are wayward, lost in worldly illusions, indulge their ears and eyes in sensory pleasures, becoming ensnared by sounds and colors, eventually drifting aimlessly like a long river, accumulating faults through self-indulgence.\"* (河上作『注』，诸本作『浮』，浮者染滞也，颠倒之徒，迷没世境，纵恣耳目，滞着声色，既而漂浪长流，愆非自积) This is incorrect; *\"浮\"* (fú) is a baseless alteration by later scholars to align with Buddhist teachings, which does not appear in the original **Lǎozǐ** (老子).\n\nGāo Hēng (高亨) remarks:\nRegarding *\"孩\"* (hái), it is a borrowed character for *\"阂\"* (hé). The **Shuōwén Jiězì** (说文解字) states:\n*\"阂, external closure.\"* (阂, 外闭也。) The **Hànshū Lǜlì Zhì** (汉书律历志) says:\n*\"阂 conceals all things\"* (阂藏万物), and **Yán Zhù** (颜注) cites **Jìn Sháo** (晋灼) as stating:\n*\"External closure is called 阂.\"* (外闭曰阂。) When the **Sage** (圣人) *\"nurtures\"* (孩) them, it means the **Sage** externally closes the common people’s ears and eyes.\n\nThe preceding passage states:\n*\"Gathering, gathering, for the world, make it one with your heart\"* (歙歙为天下浑其心), meaning to make all under heaven’s hearts uniformly muddled and ignorant, without knowledge or awareness. This passage says:\n*\"All the common people focus their ears and eyes upon it, and the **Sage** externally closes them\"* (百姓皆注其耳目，圣人皆阂之), meaning to externally block the common people’s ears and eyes, rendering them deaf and blind.\n\nThis is **Lǎozǐ**’s (老子) policy of keeping the people in simplicity. *\"孩\"* (hái), *\"咳\"* (kè), and *\"阂\"* (hé) are interchangeable as borrowed characters, hence also written as *\"骇\"* (hài) or *\"咳\"* (kè). The **Yánzǐ Wàipiān** (晏子外篇) Eighth says:\n*\"Does the nape of your neck close the heavens and earth?\"* (颈尾咳于天地乎！) **Sūn Xīngxiǎn** (孙星衍) notes:\n*\"咳 (kè) is the same as 阂 (hé).\"* (咳与阂同。) Thus, *\"咳\"* (kè) is also used for *\"阂\"* (hé).\n\n**[Phonology]**\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme readings find no rhyme in this chapter.\n**Chén Zhù** (陈柱) suggests:\nThe *\"心\"* (xīn) in the second line rhymes, the *\"善\"* (shàn) in the third line rhymes, and the *\"信\"* (xìn) in the third line rhymes.\n\nThe **Jǐnglóng** (景龙) stele edition contains **63 characters**; the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) edition contains **62**; the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions contain **64**; the **Fù** (傅) edition contains **68**; and the **Fàn** (范) edition contains **69**.\n\nThe **Héshàng** (河上) edition is titled *\"Chapter on Trusting in Virtue\"* (任德第四十九), the **Wáng** (王) edition is titled *\"Chapter Forty-Nine\"* (四十九章), and the **Fàn** (范) edition is titled *\"Chapter Forty-Nine on the Sage’s Lack of Fixed Intent\"* (圣人无常心章第四十九).\n\n**Chapter Fifty** (五十章)\n*Birth and Death* (出生入死).\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\n*Birth and Death*\n\nOf those who seek life, there are thirteen;\nOf those who court death, there are thirteen.\n**Luó Zhèn-yù** notes: The *Dūnhuáng* edition reads *\"什\"* (shí) for *\"十\"* (shí), and this is consistent below.\n**Mǎ Xù-lún** states: The *Shuōwén Jiězì* contains no *\"涂\"* (tú) or *\"途\"* (tú) characters; *\"徒\"* (tú) is likely their original form.

This is why few attain the full measure of their fate!\n\n**Qián Zhī** notes: The claim of *\"thirteen\"* has been variously interpreted—\n*Hán Fēi Zǐ*, *Héshànggōng*, *Bìxūzǐ*, and *Yè Mèngdé* associate it with the four limbs and nine orifices, an arbitrary association.\nOthers, like *Dù Guǎngchéng*, link it to the *\"ten evils and three offenses\"* (十恶三业);\n*Fàn Yìngyuán* ties it to the *\"five phases’ life-death cycles\"* (五行生死之数).\nThese interpretations are forced and unreliable.\n\n*Sū Shè* posits that the way of life and death comprises nine paths,\nwhile the way of neither life nor death is one—\n*Lǎozǐ* speaks of the nine, omitting the one,\nleaving it for the seeker to discover.\nThis seems profound, yet it interprets *Lǎozǐ* through *Buddhist* lenses.\n\n**Jiāo Jǔn** follows this, claiming enlightenment upon reading *\"出生入死\"* (shēngchū rùsǐ),\nyet his *\"playful mastery of life and death\"* is sheer misinterpretation.\nAlas!

The *Ěryǎ* states: *\"Its form resembles that of a wild cow, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* (斤).\"* In the *Huáinánzǐ*’s *\"Dìxíng Trùn\"* (地形训), it reads: *\"In the southern lands, there are the rhinoceros and elephants of Liángshān.\"* High Yù (高诱) annotates: *\"Liángshān lies in Kuàijī (会稽). The rhinoceros horns and elephant tusks of Chángshā (长沙) and Xiāngnán (湘南) are all treasures.\"* The *Shānhǎijīng* (山海经) records: *\"The **yú** (兕) emerges from the southern banks of Xiāngshuǐ (湘水), with a blackish hue.\"* As **Lǎozǐ** (老子) was a **Chǔ** (楚) native, he used the **yú** as a metaphor. **\"Without a place to lodge its horn,\"** the **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render *\"tóu\"* (投) as *\"zhù\"* (驻). **Gù** (顾) annotates in his *Chéngshū* (成疏): *\"All editions say *‘zhù’* (驻), meaning *‘to stand’*.\"* Thus, this is what **Chéng** (成) observed in his original text. In the *Huáinánzǐ*’s *\"Quán Yán Trùn\"* (诠言训), it cites: *\"The tiger has no place to deploy its claws, the **yú** has no place to deploy its horn\"*—both rendered as *\"cuò\"* (措). Jiǎng Xíchāng (蒋锡昌) states: *\"‘Zhù’ (驻) likely shares the same pronunciation as ‘zhù’ (注).\"* In **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Dá Shēng\"* (达生), it reads: *\"He who strikes with a tile is skilled\"*—the *Shìwén* (释文) cites **Lǐ** (李) as saying: *\"‘Zhù’ (注) means ‘to strike’.\"* Both *\"zhù\"* (驻) and *\"zhù\"* (注) are phonetic variants of *\"tóu\"* (投). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *\"tóu\"* (投) as *\"to thrust\"* (擿). **\"Without a place to lodge its horn\"** means that the adept at nurturing life, having avoided encountering the **yú**, thus the **yú** finds no place to thrust its horn. **Qiānzhī** confirms: Jiǎng’s explanation is correct. The *Yán Tiě Lún* (盐铁论) in *\"Shìwù Piān\"* (世务篇) renders it as **\"Without a place to use its horn\"**—*\"yòng\"* (用) also being a phonetic variant. **Lǎozǐ**’s *\"Bǎixìng jiē zhù qí ěrmù\"* (百姓皆注其耳目) uses *\"zhù\"* (注) in the sense of *\"use\"* (用).\n\n**○** Without a place to sheath its claws, weapons have no room to wield their blades. **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *\"‘Sheath its claws’\"* is rendered as *\"cuò\"* (措) in **Gù** (顾)’s annotation, **Héshàng** (河上), and **Wáng Bì** (王弼)’s text, while the *Shìwén* (释文) uses *\"cuò\"* (错). **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) observes: The **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render *\"‘cuò’* (措) as *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"; the *Shìwén* (释文) edition aligns with this. **Qiānzhī** confirms: **Luǒ Juàn** (罗卷) renders *\"‘zhuǎ’* (爪) as *\"‘○’*\"* (○), an error. The *Bēiběn* (碑本) renders *\"‘cuò’* (措) as *\"‘kāi’* (揩)\"*, also incorrect. *\"‘Kāi’* (揩)\"* is a mistaken character for *\"‘cuò’* (措).\"* Both the *Hán Fēi Jiě Lǎo* (韩非解老) and *Shìwén* (释文), as well as the **Suìzhōu** (遂州) and **Fàn** (范) editions, render it as *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"; while the *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Fénxī* (磻溪), *Shìtáng* (室町), **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷), and **Fù Yì** (傅奕) editions all use *\"‘cuò’* (措)\"*.*\"‘Cuò’* (措) and *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"* were anciently interchangeable. *\"‘Cuò’* (措)\"* means *\"to place\"*—*\"without a place to sheath its claws\"* implies *\"without a place to rest its claws.\"* *\"‘Zhuǎ’* (爪)\"* in **Luǒ Juàn** (罗卷) is rendered as *\"‘○’*\"* (○), resembling *\"‘zhuā’* (抓)\"* in form. **Xià Shēn** (夏竦) in his *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* (古文四声韵) includes the character *\"‘zhuā’* (抓)\"*, citing the ancient *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text as *\"‘○’*\"* (○). Why so? It is because there is **no place of death**. **Liú Shīpèi** (刘师培) states: *\"In the *Hán Fēizǐ Jiě Lǎo* (韩非子解老篇), it reads: ‘Embodying the Dao of Heaven and Earth, it is said: *“Without a place of death.”*’ Thus, the character *\"‘yě’*\"* (也) in this passage is a corruption of *\"‘dì’*\"* (地). **Wáng** (王) explains it as *\"‘What place of death is there?’\"*—so **Wáng**’s (王) edition also renders it as *\"‘dì’*\"* (地). Now, the *Héshàng* (河上) edition uses *\"‘dì’*\"* (地), while **Wáng**’s (王) edition uses *\"‘yě’*\"* (也), likely due to scribal errors. **Qiānzhī** confirms: All **Wáng** (王) editions uniformly render it as *\"‘dì’*\"* (地), not *\"‘yě’*\"* (也); **Liú**’s (刘) source was an erroneous edition. Among all **Wáng** (王) editions, only the **Zhèjú** (浙局) edition, based on the **Huátíng Zhāng** (华亭张) original, renders it as *\"‘sǐ yě’*\"* (死也), which lacks meaning. All the *Shíběn* (石本) and *Shǐxiěběn* (写本) editions align with this *Shí* (石) text, except the **Suìzhōu** (遂州) edition, which renders *\"‘hé’*\"* (何) as *\"‘qí’*\"* (其). The **Fàn** (范) edition renders *\"‘gù’*\"* (故) as *\"‘zāi’*\"* (哉). The **Fù** (傅) and **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷) editions have *\"‘yě’*\"* (也) after *\"‘gù’*\"* (故), while the **Yán** (严) and **Shìtáng** (室町) editions use *\"‘zāi’*\"* (哉). The *Hán Fēi Jiě Lǎo* (韩非解老) and **Wáng Xīnzhī** (王羲之) editions, along with the **Fù** (傅) edition, include *\"‘yān’*\"* (焉) after *\"‘dì’*\"* (地)—this is an added character for rhetorical effect, unrelated to the core meaning. **Gāo Yán’dì** (高延第) states: This chapter instructs those navigating turbulent times that the **yú** and tiger, as well as weapons and blades, are all ominous and violent, metaphorically illustrating the treacherous paths of the world and the deceitful nature of human affairs. Reading **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Yǎngshēng Zhǔ\"* (养生主) and *\"Rénjiān Shì\"* (人间世) suffices to grasp the intent of this chapter—it does not truly advocate following a hungry tiger. The followers of **Gě Hóng** (葛洪) fail to understand this meaning, fabricating talismans and spells to ward off evil, claiming one can enter mountains and subdue spirits—utterly absurd.\n\n**[Yīnyùn]** This chapter lacks rhyme in **Jiāng**’s (江) pronunciation. **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) suggests: *\"‘sān’*\"* (三) rhymes with *\"‘sān’*\"* (三). **Qiānzhī** confirms: *\"‘Sān’*\"* (三) in ancient pronunciation was akin to *\"‘sēn’*\"* (森). The *\"Pí Biàn\"* (摽) of the *\"Shī\"* (诗) reads: *\"Its fruit is threefold (三), seeking my commoners (庶士), until now (今兮)\"*—harmonizing with the modern rhyme. Additionally, *\"‘hòu’*\"* (厚) and *\"‘jiǎo’*\"* (角) form a rhyme. **Fāng Yǐzhì** (方以智) in his *Tōng Yǎ* (通雅) states: *\"‘Jiǎo’*\"* (角) in ancient pronunciation was *\"‘lù’*\"* (禄); in the *\"Shī\"* (诗), it rhymes with *\"‘wū’*\"* (屋), while **Dōng Fāng Shào** (东方朔) and **Zhòng Chángtǒng** (仲长统) used it to rhyme with *\"‘zú’*\"* (足) and *\"‘sú’*\"* (俗), respectively. Now, *\"‘lù’*\"* (禄), *\"‘hòu’*\"* (厚), *\"‘zú’*\"* (足), and *\"‘wū’*\"* (屋) are all classified under the *\"Hóu\"* (侯) phonetic department by **Wáng Niànsūn** (王念孙), so *\"‘jiǎo’*\"* (角) and *\"‘hòu’*\"* (厚) belong to the same department and rhyme.\n\nThe **Jǐnglóng Bēiběn** (景龙碑本) contains **79 characters**; the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) edition matches this, as does the **Héshàng Gōng Shìdétáng** (河上公世德堂本) edition. **Wáng**’s (王) edition has **80 characters**; the **Fù** (傅) edition has **87 characters**; the **Fàn** (范) edition has **83 characters**.

Moreover, **Gāo Yè** (高翿) renders *\"restore its clarity\"* (复归其明) as *\"in clarity\"* (于明).\n\n*\"Without leaving the body to calamity\"* (无遗身殃) is called *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常).\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) says: *\"Adhere to the constant\"* (习常) is rendered as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) in the **Yùzhòng** (御注) and **Gāo Yè** (高翿) editions.\n**Takuchi Yoshio** (武内义雄) states: The **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render it as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常), with *\"adhere\"* (习) and *\"assail\"* (袭) being homophones and interchangeable.\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: The **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Nài** (柰) editions, **Gùhuān** (顾欢), the **Zhū Héshàng** (诸河上) editions, and the **Wáng** (王) editions all render it as *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常). **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Lóu Zhèng** (楼正), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Yán** (严), **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), **Fàn** (范), **Wáng Xǔzhēn** (王羲之), and **Zhào Mèngfǔ** (赵孟俯) render it as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常), with *\"assail\"* (袭) and *\"adhere\"* (习) being anciently interchangeable. The **Wénxuǎn** (文选) commentary by **Rèn Yànshēng** (任彦升) on *\"Shàngshū Jīnténg\"* (尚书金滕) states: *\"Adhere\"* (习) and *\"assail\"* (袭) are interchangeable, and *\"Cloth\"* (裳) is the ancient form of *\"constant\"* (常). The **Shūmíng** (释名) explains: *\"Cloth\"* (裳), *\"barrier\"* (障); it is what one uses to shield oneself.*」 The phrase *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) in this chapter shares the same meaning as *\"conceal the light\"* (袭明) in Chapter 27—both imply the **Daoist** practice of preserving and concealing one’s brilliance.\n\nThe **Yùpiàn** (玉篇) defines *\"assail\"* (袭): *\"Left-lapelled robe\"* (左衽袍), *\"to enter\"* (入), *\"layered garment\"* (重衣).*」 Its meaning aligns with layered garments shielding one’s brilliance. The **Yè Mèngdé** (叶梦得) edition correctly renders *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常) as *\"cloth\"* (裳).\n\nHowever, in the **Lǎozǐ** (老子) text, *\"light\"* (光) and *\"clarity\"* (明) carry distinct meanings (as **Dàtián Qíngxuān** (大田晴轩) explains). In Chapter 16: *\"Returning to the **Way** is called the constant, knowing the constant is called clarity\"* (复命曰常，知常曰明); in Chapter 52: *\"Knowing harmony is called the constant, knowing the constant is called clarity\"* (知和曰常，知常曰明); in Chapter 33: *\"Knowing others is wisdom, self-knowing is clarity\"* (知人者智，自知者明); and in Chapter 22: *\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明), all instances of *\"clarity\"* (明) refer to **inner wisdom** (内在之智慧). In Chapter 58: *\"Light without dazzling\"* (光而不耀); in Chapters 4 and 52: *\"Harmonizing its light\"* (和其光); and in Chapter 24: *\"Using its light, returning to its clarity\"* (用其光，复归其明), all instances of *\"light\"* (光) refer to **outer expression** (外表之智慧).*」 This implies blending with the mundane, not dazzling, thus concealing one’s light—akin to **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Qíwùlùn\"* (齐物论) *\"Bǎoguāng\"* (葆光), which is here termed *\"assail the cloth\"* (袭裳).\n\n*\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明) and *\"Not seeing oneself is clarity\"* (不自见故明) in Chapter 41, *\"The **Way** of clarity is like darkness\"* (明道若昧) in Chapter 41, all suggest concealing one’s clarity—*\"This is called subtle clarity\"* (是谓微明) in Chapter 36 and *\"This is called assailing clarity\"* (是谓袭明) in Chapter 27. Thus, *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) and *\"assail the clarity\"* (袭明) seem similar yet differ in meaning.\n\n【**Phonology**】 Jiāng’s rhyme reading for this chapter: *shǐ* (始), *mǔ* (母), *mǔ* (母), *zǐ* (子), *mǔ* (母), *dài* (殆) (韵部 *zhī*), *mén* (门), *qín* (勤) (韵部 *wén*), *shì* (事), *jiù* (救) (韵部 *zhī* and *yōu*通韵, *shì*协*shǐ* 去声 *shòu*反), *míng* (明), *qiáng* (强), *guāng* (光), *míng* (明), *yāng* (殃), *cháng* (常) (韵部 *yáng*).\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: *\"Affairs\"* (事) belongs to the *zhī* (之) rhyme, *\"salvation\"* (救) to the *yōu* (幽) rhyme, with *zhī* (之) and *yōu* (幽) being interchangeable. **Xí Zòng** (奚侗) agrees. **Xí** (奚) states: *\"Mother\"* (母) is read as *\"each\"* (每). *\"Affairs\"* (事) and *\"salvation\"* (救) form a rhyme. The *\"Shìguānzǐ Shìbīng\"* (鹖冠子世兵篇) uses the *zhī* (之) rhyme with *\"game\"* (游), *\"post\"* (邮), following the same pattern.\n\n**Gù Yànwǔ** (顾炎武) in *\"Tángyùn zhèng\"* (唐韵正) Volume 14, under *\"Fifty-two, thick\"* (十五厚), notes: *\"Mother\"* (母) has an ancient pronunciation of *mǎn yǐ* (满以)反, as seen in this chapter of **Lǎozǐ** (老子) and *\"The nameless is the **beginning** of heaven and earth, the named is the **mother** of ten thousand things\"* (无名天地之始，有名万物之母). *\"Sudden as the sea, drifting as if without end\"* (忽兮若海，漂兮若无所止), *\"All people have their own ends, yet I alone am stubborn and coarse\"* (众人皆有以，而我独顽以鄙), *\"I alone differ from others, thus valuing the **mother**\"* (我独异于人而贵食母). *\"Standing alone yet unchanging, revolving yet without peril\"* (独立而不改，周行而不殆), *\"It can be the **mother** of all under heaven\"* (可以为天下母). *\"The **mother** of a state, which can endure long\"* (有国之母，可以长久). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) states: *\"Affairs\"* (事) and *\"salvation\"* (救) form a rhyme, with *\"affairs\"* (事) being *zhī* (之) rhyme, *qùshēng* (去声), and *\"salvation\"* (救) being *yōu* (幽) rhyme, *qùshēng* (去声). To consider them as rhyming despite differing rhyme groups is like the *\"Shīyī\"* (诗翼) rhyming *\"clothing\"* (俅) with *\"○\"* (基), *\"cow\"* (牛), and *\"mole\"* (鼒).\n\nThe **Jīnglóngbēi** (景龙碑) edition contains **72 characters**; the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌), **Héshàng** (河上), and **Wáng** (王) editions match this; the **Fù** (傅) edition has **73 characters**; the **Fàn** (范) edition has **72 characters**. The **Héshàng** (河上) edition is titled *\"Returning to the **Way** of the **Way**\"* (归元第五十二), the **Wáng** (王) edition *\"Chapter 52\"* (五十二章), and the **Fàn** (范) edition *\"Chapter 52: The **Way** of the **Beginning** of All Under Heaven\"* (天下有始章第五十二).\n\n**Chapter 53**\n*\"When I am subtly aware, walking the Great Dao,\nI fear only the crooked.\"*\n\n**Ding Zhongxu** says: *\"Jié\"* (介) means *\"slight\"*—*Yīqīng Yìyì* (一切經音義) Volume 15 cites Liu Zhan’s (劉瓛) commentary on the *Yì* (易), and the *Lìzǐ* (列子) *Yángzhū* (楊朱) chapter’s *Shìwén* (釋文) explains *\"those without subtle concerns\"* (無介然之慮者). In the *Lìzǐ* *Zhòngní* (仲尼) chapter:\n*\"If there is even the slightest awareness,\nand the sound of ‘yes’—\nwhether distant in the eight desolations beyond,\nor near in the hairs of my brows—\nif anything approaches me,\nI shall surely know it.\"*\n\n**Song Lin Xíyì** (宋林希逸) says: *\"Subtle awareness\"* (介然之有) refers to the faintest visible trace.\n\nAgain, *\"jié\"* (介) also means *\"firm and unyielding\"*—as in the *Xúnzǐ* (荀子) *Xiūshēn* (修身) chapter’s note: *\"Virtue in the body is firm, and one must surely take pride in it.\"*\n\nZhang Chong’s (張充) letter to Wang Jian (王俭):\n*\"Firm resolve stands like a towering cliff,\nunyielding resolve cuts across the sea’s edge.\"*\n\n**Wang Renxun** (王念孙) says: Wang Bi (王弼) interprets *\"I fear only the crooked\"* (唯施是畏) as *\"I fear only deeds\"* (唯施為之是畏), and the *Heshang Gong* (河上公) annotation is similarly brief. Renxun notes that both scholars take *\"shī\"* (施) to mean *\"deeds\"* (施為), which is incorrect. *\"Shī\"* (施) should be read as *\"yí\"* (迤), meaning *\"crooked.\"* Walking the Great Dao, one fears only straying into crooked paths.\n\nLater, it states: *\"The Great Dao is most smooth, yet people prefer byways\"* (大道甚夷，而民好径). The *Heshang Gong* annotation explains: *\"Byways are crooked and unorthodox.\"* This confirms the meaning.\n\n*(Note: The \"byways\" here are the same as the \"crooked\" above. Crooked paths easily mislead people, hence \"I fear only the crooked.\" Wang Bi’s note says: \"The Great Dao is vast and straight, yet people still abandon it, preferring crooked byways—how much more so when deeds obstruct the Great Dao’s path!\" This adds an extra layer of meaning beyond the text, which is incorrect.)*\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (說文解字) defines *\"yí\"* (迤) as *\"crooked movement,\"* citing the *Yǔgōng* (禹貢): *\"Eastward it curves northward, converging at Huì.\"* In the *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) *Líliú* (離娄) chapter, *\"Shī from the virtuous man’s path\"* (施從良人之所之), Zhao’s (趙) note says: *\"Shī means to stray crookedly.\"*\n\nDing Gong (丁公) pronounces it *\"yí\"* (迤). In the *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) *Qísú* (齊俗) chapter: *\"Abandoning vice is not merely rejecting crooked paths\"* (去非者，非批邪施也), Gao’s (高) note says: *\"Shī means slight deviation.\"* In the *Yàoliào* (要略) chapter: *\"Meeting straight and crooked paths\"* (接径直施), Gao’s note says: *\"Shī means crooked.\"*\n\nThis proves *\"shī\"* (施) and *\"yí\"* (迤) are interchangeable. In the *Shǐjì* (史記) *Jiǎ Shēng* (賈生) transmission: *\"On the day of *gēngzǐ*, it slants\"* (庚子日施兮), the *Hànshū* (漢書) renders *\"shī\"* (施) as *\"xié\"* (斜), which also means *\"crooked.\"*\n\n**Hán Fēi** (韓非) in the *Xiělǎo* (解老) chapter explains this passage’s meaning:\n*\"The so-called Great Dao is the straight path.\nThe so-called ‘crooked’ is the crooked path.\nThe so-called ‘byways’ are the ornate.\nOrnate is the division of the crooked path.\"*\n\nThis is further clear evidence.\n\n**Liu Shīpèi** (劉師培) notes: Wang Bi’s interpretation is correct.\n\nThe *Hán Fēi Zǐ* in the *Xiělǎo* chapter states:\n*\"The *Dàodéjīng*’s so-called ‘Great Dao’ is the *duāndào* [straight path].\nThe so-called ‘*mào shī*’ is the crooked path.\nThe so-called ‘*jìng dà*’ is ornate.\nOrnate is the division of the crooked path.\"*\n\nFrom this passage, it is evident that the original reading of *\"wéi shī\"* was *\"mào shī\"*, or that *\"mào\"* was prefixed with *\"wéi\"* above. The *Guóyǔ* under *Jìn* states:\n*\"Mào is the adornment of emotion.\"* The *Guǎngyà* under *Shìgǔ* explains:\n*\"Mào means artifice.\"* Thus, the meaning of *\"mào\"* aligns with embellishment, making it synonymous with *\"shī\"* as a crooked path.\n\nThe Great Dao is most straightforward, yet people delight in ornateness.\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: *\"While people delight in ornateness\"*—the *Yùzhù* and *Gāoxī* versions read *\"mín qǐ hào jìng\"*, while the *Héshàng* and *Wáng Bì* versions read *\"ér mín\"*. **Luó Zhènyù** states: *\"‘While’ (ér), in the Dunhuang text, is ‘qí’.\"*\n\n**Qiān Zhī** examines:\n*\"Yí\"* is rendered as *\"○\"* in the *Fàn* text. **Fàn** says: *\"○ was the original reading; the *Shuōwén* states: ‘To walk with ease.’\"* Additionally, the character *\"jìng\"* is written as *\"jìng\"* in **Yán Kějūn**’s version, while the *Jìnglóng*, *Yùzhù*, and *Sòngkān Héshàng* versions all render it as *\"xì\"*. The *Yìlín* (卷一) cites the *Jīng* as *\"ér mín hào xì\"*, with the annotation from *Héshànggōng*: *\"Xì means crooked and unstraight.\"* Thus, the text **Mǎ Zǒng** saw was *\"xì\"*. The *Yùpiàn* under the *Rén* department states:\n*\"Xì (急也), niú gēng, niú yàn liè\"*—likely incorrect.\n\nThe phrase *\"ér rén\"* is rendered as *\"mín shèn\"* in the *Gāoxī*, *Pánxī*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Fàn*, and *Zhào* versions.\n\n**Liú Shīpèi** argues: *\"Xì\"* should be followed by *\"dà\"* (大). In Chapter 41 (*\"Dà xiào zhī\"*), **Wáng Yìxún** posits it should read *\"dà ér xiào zhī\"*. *\"Dà\"* is cognate with *\"yú\"* (迂); though **Wáng Bì** interprets *\"yú\"* as circuitous, here *\"dà\"* truly means *\"yú\"*. The *Hànshū* *Jiàosì Zhì* states: *\"Guài yú\"* (怪迂), with **Yán Zhì**’s annotation: *\"Yú means circuitous and distant.\"* Thus, *\"yú\"* aligns with *\"jìng\"*, hence the pairing of *\"jìng\"* and *\"dà\"* in this passage.\n\n**Qiān Zhī** examines: Though **Liú Shīpèi**’s argument is grounded in the *Hán Fēi Zǐ*, it remains somewhat strained.\n\n**Wáng Xiānshèn** states: *\"In the *Dàodéjīng*, ‘The Great Dao is most straightforward, yet people delight in ornateness,’ *Héshànggōng* comments: ‘Jìng means crooked and unstraight.’\"* Here, the *\"dà\"* (大) is superfluous.\n\nThe court is most corrupt, the fields lie overgrown,\nthe granaries stand empty.\n**Mǎ Xùlún** says: *\"The court is most corrupt\"*—*\"corrupt\"* (除) is borrowed for *\"filthy\"* (污), just as *\"rǔ\"* (杇) is written as *\"tú\"* (涂). The various scholars interpreting *\"corrupt\"* as *\"governed\"* are incorrect.\n\n**Takeshi Takauchi** states: The *Dun* and *Sui* manuscripts have *\"overgrown\"* (芜) as *\"sprouts\"* (苗).\n**Qián Zhī** notes: The *Fǎjīng Dūndīng* manuscript reads *\"sprouts\"* (苗), while the *Luó* manuscript reads *\"overgrown\"* (芜).\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"Sprouts\"* (苗), *\"grass growing in fields.\"*\nThe *Gōngyáng Zhuan* (on Duke Huan’s fourth year) annotation says: *\"Sprouts\"* (苗), *\"hair\"* (毛).\nThis is also a borrowed character for *\"overgrown\"* (芜).\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* defines *\"overgrown\"* (芜) as *\"filth.\"*\nThe *Zhōu Yǔ* says: *\"Fields and plots lie overgrown\"* (田畴荒芜), annotated as *\"filth.\"*\nThus, *\"the fields lie overgrown\"* (田甚芜) means the land is filthy and untended.\nAgain, *\"corrupt\"* (除) is mistakenly written as *\"hold\"* (持) in the *Gāo* and *Hàn* manuscripts.\n\nThey adorn themselves in fine colors,\nwear sharp swords at their sides,\nare gluttonous in their feasting,\nyet hoard wealth in excess—\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: *\"Adorn themselves in fine colors\"* (服文彩) is annotated as *\"colors\"* (彩) in the *Yù* and *Gāo Yì* manuscripts.\n*\"Gluttonous in their feasting\"* (厌饮食) is annotated as *\"gluttonous\"* (厌) in the *Yù*, but as *\"sated\"* (冒) in the *Gāo Yì*.\n**Luó Zhènyù** states: *\"Colors\"* (彩) is written as *\"silk\"* (丝) in the *Guǎngmíng* manuscript.\n*\"Gluttonous\"* (厌) is written as *\"sated\"* (餍) in the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript.\n*\"Wealth\"* (财) is written as *\"resources\"* (资) in the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript.\n**Takeshi Takauchi** notes: The *Dun* and *Sui* manuscripts read *\"resource-goods\"* (资货), aligning with *Hán Fēi Zǐ*’s *Yù Lǎo*.\n**Qián Zhī** examines: *\"Colors\"* (彩) is written as *\"patterns\"* (采) in the manuscripts of *Yán*, *Péng*, *Fàn*, *Pánxī*, and *Lóu Zhèng*.\n*\"Colors\"* (彩) and *\"patterns\"* (采) are the same; the *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"From silk, with the phonetic *cǎi*.\"*\nThe *Yīqiè Jīng Yīnyì* cites the *Shàngshū*: *\"Five colors vividly displayed in five hues.\"*\nThe *Kǎozhèng Jì* states: *\"Five colors complete is called embroidery.\"*\nChén Jǐngyuán’s annotation cites *Fù Yì*: *\"Patterns\"* (采) *\"is the ancient form of embroidery\"* (绣).\n**Yǔ Huì** says: *\"Adorn themselves in fine colors\"* (服文彩), the *Lín* manuscript writes *\"patterns\"* (采) as in *Hán Fēi Zǐ*.

Thus, it should be followed, even if *Lǎo Zǐ* were alive to dispute it.\n\nAgain, **Liú Zǐhóu**’s rhyme, **Lín Xiāo’ōng**, and **Liú Huìmèng**’s interpretations all treat it as *\"loud\"* (夸), a failure to investigate.\nThe *Héshànggōng* annotation also writes *\"loud\"* (夸), yet how could the gods of immortality be so lowly?\n**Yú Yì** states: *\"Loud\"* (夸) has no meaning.\n*Hán Fēi Zǐ*’s *Jiě Lǎo Piān* reads *\"robber-zhu\"* (盗竽), explaining:\n*\"The *zhu* is the leader of the five tones. When the *zhu* leads, the bells and strings follow; when the *zhu* plays, all music harmonizes. Now, when great deceivers act, the common people follow; when the common people follow, petty thieves will surely join. Thus, those who adorn themselves in fine colors, wear sharp swords, gluttonously feast, yet hoard wealth in excess—this is called *robber-zhu* (盗竽).\"*\nThis was clearly the ancient text, and it should be followed.\n\n**Gǔ Yánwù** says: *\"Loud\"* (夸) in ancient times was pronounced *kū*.\nIn *Lǎo Zǐ*’s *\"The court is most corrupt\"* to *\"this is called robber-loud\"* (盗夸), the *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"Loud\"* (夸), *\"from *dà* (大), with the phonetic *yú* (于).\"* Again, *wū* (洿), *kū* (刳), and *qū* (刳) all derive their sound from *夸*.\n**Yáng Shèn**, basing it on *Hán Fēi Zǐ*, changed *Lǎo Zǐ*’s *\"robber-loud\"* (盗夸) to *\"robber-zhu\"* (盗竽), likely incorrectly (*Tángyùn Zhèngjì* Vol. 4).\nAgain, he says: *\"This is called robber-loud\"* (是谓盗夸), **Yáng Shèn** changed it to *\"robber-zhu\"* (盗竽), claiming it was based on *Hán Fēi Zǐ*, yet he did not know that the ancients read *\"loud\"* (夸) as *\"hollow\"* (刳), which rhymes with *\"corrupt\"* (除) (*Dá Lǐ Zǐdé Shū*).\n\n**Yú Shěngwú** states: *\"Robber\"* (盗) should be read as *\"boastful\"* (诞), as *dào* (盗) and *dàn* (诞) share the same initial and are both *dìng* (定) finals. The *Dūnhuáng* manuscript writes *\"loud\"* (夸) as *\"loud\"* (夸), so *\"robber-loud\"* (盗夸) is *\"boastful-loud\"* (诞夸).\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"Loud\"* (夸), *\"from *dà* (大), with the phonetic *yú* (于).\"*\nThe *Jǐnglóng* manuscript writes *\"loud\"* (夸) as *\"○\"*.\n*Hán Fēi Zǐ*’s *Jiě Lǎo* reads *\"robber-zhu\"* (盗竽), but *\"robber-zhu\"* (盗竽) is *\"boastful-loud\"* (诞夸), with *\"loud\"* (夸), *\"zhu\"* (竽), and *\"loud\"* (夸) all as borrowed characters. *Hán Fēi Zǐ*’s interpretation of *zhu* as a musical instrument is incorrect.\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Běnshēng* states: *\"Not named for boastfulness\"* (非夸以名也), with the annotation: *\"Boastful\"* (夸) *\"means hollow\"* (虚). In the *Xúnzǐ Róngrǔ*: *\"Is it not boastful?\"* (岂不迂乎哉), with the annotation: *\"Boastful\"* (迂) *\"means corrupt\"* (失). The meanings of *\"corrupt\"* (失) and *\"hollow\"* (虚) are interrelated.\n\nThe *Hànshū Wǔxíng Zhì* records *\"Shū Yú, Jì Fá\"* (叔迂季伐), annotated as *\"Boastful\"* (迂) *\"means boastful and hollow\"* (夸诞). The passage above—*\"The morning’s affairs were excessively corrupt\"* (朝甚除), *\"fields lay overgrown\"* (田甚芜), *\"granaries were empty\"* (仓甚虚), *\"adorned in fine silks, girded with sharp blades, gluttonous in drink and food, yet wealth overflowed\"* (服文彩，带利剑，厌饮食，财货有余)—all describe boastful excess. The context above and below aligns seamlessly.\n\nThe phrases *\"boastful and hollow\"* (诞夸) and *\"boastful and corrupt\"* (诞迂) were ancient colloquialisms, also rendered as *\"boastful excess\"* (夸诞) or *\"corrupt boastfulness\"* (迂诞). The *Xúnzǐ Bùgǒu* states: *\"Boastful excess breeds confusion\"* (夸诞生惑). The *Rúxiào* declares: *\"Boastful excess is hollow\"* (夸诞则虚). The *Bàopǔzǐ Qiàohuò* observes: *\"Superficial minds are prone to boastful excess\"* (浅薄之徒，率多夸诞). The *Shǐjì Xiàowǔ Běnjì* records: *\"Matters were as boastful and corrupt\"* (事如迂诞). The *Hànshū Yìwén Zhì* notes: *\"Then boastful, deceitful, and fantastical texts proliferated further\"* (则诞欺怪迂之文，弥以益多). All usages align.\n\nIf *\"robber\"* (盗) is read literally, the phrase *\"robber-boastful\"* (盗夸) becomes inscrutable. **Qián Zhēn** concludes: *\"It must be read as ‘robber-○’* (盗○). The *Jiǎwén Sìshēng Yùn* cites *Gǔ Lǎozǐ* with *\"boastful\"* (夸), matching the stele text. The *Yùzhù*, *Zhào Mèngfǔ* edition, and *Fàn* edition concur. The *Fàn* edition renders it as *\"○\"*, likely conflating with *\"○\"* (the character). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* defines *\"○\"* as *\"that which startles\"* (所以惊人也), composed of *\"dà\"* (大) and *\"○\"*. Alternatively: *\"Vulgar speech calls relentless theft ‘○’, pronounced like *hú* (瓠).\"*\n\n**Phonology:** Jiang Shì’s rhyme reading lacks a rhyme. **Yáo Wéntián** groups *\"除、芜、虚、余、竽\"* (twelve *Yú* level tone). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** and **Xí Dòng** follow. *\"竽\"* is read as *\"夸\"*. **Gāo Běn Hàn** groups *\"除、芜、虚、余、竽\"* (alternately *\"夸\"*) with *\"cǎi\"* (采), *\"shí\"* (食), *\"zāi\"* (哉) as rhyming. **Takuchi Yoshio** rhymes *\"wèi\"* (畏), *\"yí\"* (夷), *\"jìng\"* (径). **Qián Zhēn** notes: *\"‘畏’ and ‘夷’ belong to the *zhǐ* department; ‘径’ does not rhyme.\"* Jiang Yǒng’s *Gǔyùn Biāozhǔn* (Vol. 19, *Má* section) cites *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"The morning’s affairs were excessively corrupt\"* (朝甚除) to *\"This is called ‘robber-boastful’\"* (是谓盗夸). The *Jǐnglóng* stele text (52 characters), *Dūnhuáng*, *Wáng*, and *Fàn* editions agree. The *Héshàng* edition has 51 characters; the *Fù* edition, 54. The *Héshàng* edition is titled *\"Yìzhèng Dìsānshísān\"* (益证第五十三), the *Wáng* edition *\"Dìsānshísān Zhāng\"* (五十三章), and the *Fàn* edition *\"Shǐwǒ Jièrán Zhāng Dìsānshísān\"* (使我介然章第五十三).\n\n**Chapter 54:**\n*\"The well-built stands unshaken; the well-embraced is not cast off.

The *Fù* edition writes *\"bào\"* (抱) as *\"guàn\"* (袌); the *Fàn* edition, *\"tuō\"* (脱) as *\"jué\"* (捝). *Yán Zhūn*, *Héshàng*, *Yùzhù*, *Pánxī*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Gù*, *Zhào*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, and *Gāo* editions all omit *\"yǐ\"* (以). Additionally, the *Húnnán Zhǔshù Xuányìn*’s *\"Lún\"* section cites the first sentence identically to this stele text.\n\nThe *Huánnán Zhǔshù Xuányìn* annotates *\"The well-built stands unshaken\"* (善建者不拔) as *\"Speaking of the formless nature of building\"* (言建之无形也). **Wáng Niǎnsūn** states: *\"These six characters are the main text, not annotation. ‘Thus, the well-built stands unshaken’* (故善建者不拔) quotes *Lǎozǐ*, while ‘Speaking of the formless nature of building’* (言建之无形也) elucidates its meaning. The *Wénzǐ* correctly renders it: ‘Thus, the well-built stands unshaken, speaking of the formless nature of building’\"* (故善建者不拔，言建之无形也). This aligns with *Lǎozǐ*’s ancient intent. **Hán Fēizǐ**’s *Yùlǎo* cites *\"The well-built stands unshaken, the well-embraced is not cast off, descendants with their sacrifices never cease\"* (善建不拔，善抱不脱，子孙以其祭祀世世不辍), where **Gù Guǎngqì** notes: *\"The *Déjīng* lacks the four characters ‘yǐqí shìshì’* (以其世世).\"* Again, the *Jiělǎo* quotes *\"unshaken\"* (不拔), *\"not cast off\"* (不脱), *\"sacrifices unbroken\"* (祭祀不绝), showing *\"cease\"* (辍) is also written *\"absolute\"* (绝), with identical meanings. **Takuchi Toshio**’s *Dùn* edition renders *\"zhé\"* (辍) as *\"zuì\"* (醊); **Luó Juàn** as *\"chuò\"* (啜)—both incorrect.\n\n*\"Cultivate the self, and virtue becomes genuine;\nCultivate the family, and virtue overflows.\"*\n\n「Cultivate the self, virtue becomes genuine;\nCultivate the village, its virtue grows enduring;\nCultivate the realm, its virtue becomes abundant;\nCultivate the world, its virtue becomes universal.»\n\n**Yán Kějūn** remarks: *\"Cultivate the self\"*—Hé Shàng and Wáng Bì insert *\"yú\"* (于) after *\"xiū\"* (修) in each instance: *\"xiū yú shēn,\"* *\"xiū yú jiā,\"* and *\"xiū yú xiāng.\"* The Imperial Commentary and Gāo Yì omit *\"yú\"* in all five clauses.\n\nThe phrase *\"its virtue overflows\"* (其德有余) is rendered *\"nǎi yú\"* (乃余) in most editions, while the Imperial Commentary reads *\"qí dé néng yǒu yú,\"* matching *Hán Fēizǐ*.\n\nIn *\"Cultivate the realm\"* (修之于国), *Hán Fēizǐ* uses *\"yú bāng\"* (于邦), harmonizing with *\"fēng\"* (丰) in rhyme—later editions altered *\"bāng\"* to *\"guó\"* to avoid the Han taboo.\n\n**Luó Zhèn-yù** notes: The *Jǐngfú* edition omits *\"zhī\"* (之) throughout. The *Jǐnglóng*, Imperial Commentary, and *Dūnhuáng* manuscripts likewise lack *\"yú\"* in all four subsequent clauses. The *Dūnhuáng* text further renders *\"nǎi\"* (乃) as *\"néng\"* (能) in each instance.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary substitutes *\"○\"* (a blank) for *\"zhēn\"* (真). *\"Its virtue overflows\"* (其德乃余) appears as *\"qí dé yǒu yú\"* in *Jǐnglóng* and *Jǐngfú*, while the *Dūnhuáng* edition adds *\"yǒu\"* (有) before *\"yú.\"*\n\n**Takuchi Yoshio** observes: Both *Dūn* and *Suì* manuscripts render *\"nǎi\"* (乃) as *\"néng\"* (能).\n\n**Qiānzhī** notes: The *Péng*, *Zhào*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Lóuzhèng*, and *Gāo Yì* editions likewise omit the five *\"yú\"* (于) characters. The *Shìtáng* edition places *\"nǎi\"* (乃) above *\"yǒu\"* (有), while omitting the four preceding *\"yú\"* (于) characters. **Yán’s** edition lacks the clause *\"its virtue becomes genuine\"* (其德乃真), aligning *\"its virtue overflows\"* (其德有余) with Hé Shàng and Luó Juàn’s stone text.\n\nAdditionally, *Fù* and *Fàn* render *\"guó\"* (国) as *\"bāng\"* (邦), with *Fù* further substituting *\"pǔ\"* (溥) for *\"pǔ\"* (普). **Fàn** states: *\"The character ‘bāng’ aligns with *Hán Fēizǐ* and ancient editions.\"*\n\n**Gù Guǎngqì** notes: *Fù*’s edition uses *\"pǔ\"* (溥) instead of *\"pǔ\"* (普)—both characters are identical in meaning.\n\n**Yì Shùndǐng** cites: According to the *Zhōuyì Jíjiě* (Pei’s Commentary on *Yì*), Pei’s annotation on the *Lǎozǐ* states: *\"Cultivate the self, virtue becomes genuine.\"* The *Shījù Zhèngyì* (Preface to the *Shījìng*) quotes the *Lǎozǐ*: *\"Cultivate the family, its virtue overflows; cultivate the realm, its virtue becomes abundant.\"* Both omit *\"yú\"* (于), and Pei’s citation further lacks *\"qí\"* (其).\n\n**Jiāo Jǔn** states: *\"Bāng\"* (邦) is sometimes written *\"guó\"* (国)—Han scholars altered it to avoid Emperor Gāozǔ’s taboo, disrupting the rhyme. The modern text follows *Hán Fēizǐ*’s original.\n\n**Hóng Yìxuān** argues: *\"Cultivate the realm, its virtue becomes abundant\"* (修之于国，其德乃丰) should read *\"bāng\"* (邦) instead of *\"guó\"* (国). The parallel structure—*shēn* (身), *zhēn* (真); *jiā* (家), *yú* (余); *xiāng* (乡), *cháng* (长); *xià* (下), *pǔ* (普)—demands *\"bāng\"* (邦) and *\"fēng\"* (丰) for rhyme. In *Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo*, *\"Cultivate the realm, its virtue becomes abundant\"* (修之邦，其德乃丰) and *\"observe the realm to govern the realm\"* (以邦观邦) retain the original character. Thus, the full progression is:\nObserve the self to cultivate the self,\nObserve the family to cultivate the family,\nObserve the village to cultivate the village,\nObserve the realm to cultivate the realm,\nObserve the world to cultivate the world.\n\nHow do I know the world follows this principle?\nBy this.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** remarks: *\"The world follows this principle\"* (天下之然) is rendered *\"zhī rán zāi\"* (之然哉) by Hé Shàng and *\"rán zāi\"* (然哉) by Wáng Bì, omitting *\"zhī\"* (之).\n\n**Luó Zhèn-yù** notes: The *Jǐnglóng*, Imperial Commentary, and *Dūnhuáng* manuscripts uniformly read: *\"Wú hé yǐ zhī tiānxià zhī rán?

Having now confirmed the rhyme schemes of *Yì Lín* [易林]’s *\"gōng\"* [功] and *\"guó\"* [国], it is clear that *xiāng* [乡], *zhǎng* [长], *fēng* [丰], and *guó* [国] each follow their own rhyme scheme—this is the **轆轳押法** [lùluó yāfǎ, alternating rhyme technique], yet I still hesitate to fully accept this.\n\nUpon examining **Cháng Wǔ**’s poetry, it is evident that *\"fù\"* [父] rhymes with *\"shì\"* [士], and *\"guó\"* [国] rhymes with *\"wǒ\"* [我], a vast and resonant correspondence. Indeed, *\"guó\"* [国] belongs to the *Zhí* [职] department, functioning as an **入聲** [rùshēng, entering tone] counterpart to *\"zhēng\"* [蒸]. Since *Dōng* [东] and *Zhēng* [蒸] originally shared the same rhyme, this explains their rhyming usage. Thus, rhyme schemes do follow discernible patterns and are not entirely arbitrary (Volume One).\n\n**Qiānzhī** observes: **Máo’s** explanation is incorrect. **Chái Shàobǐng**’s *Gǔyùn tōngjuàn* [古韵通卷] under the *Dōng* [东] department and its related rhymes also cites *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"guó\"* [国] as pronounced *\"gōng\"* [公], a mistake identical to **Máo’s**.\n\nIndeed, none of them recognize that *\"guó\"* [国] in modern usage was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦], altered due to **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳]—*Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo* [解老] clearly attests to *\"bāng\"* [邦].\n\n**Jiāng Yǒng**’s *Gǔyùn biāozhǔn rùshēng* [古韵标准入声] under the **sixth department** states: In *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"Xiū zhī yú bāng, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之于邦，其德乃丰], variant texts render *\"bāng\"* [邦] as *\"guó\"* [国], likely another instance of **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] alteration. In *Yì Lín* [易林], *\"hòujì nóng gōng, fù lì wǒ guó\"* [后稷农功，富利我国], *\"guó\"* [国] is also the original *\"bāng\"* [邦]. Modern rhyme books incorrectly cite this rhyme as *\"guó\"* [国] with *gōng hóng* [公红] tone, a grave error.\n\n**Kǒng Guǎngsēn**’s *Shīshēng lèi* [诗声类] (Volume Four) states:\nExamining *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字]: *\"Bāng\"* [邦], composed of *\"yì\"* [邑] and the phonetic *\"fēng\"* [丰].\n*Shìmíng* [释名] explains: *\"Bāng\"* [邦], meaning **\"to enfeoff\"** [封], for enfeoffing meritorious service.\nThus, *\"bāng\"* [邦] is clearly pronounced as *\"fēng\"* [封].\n\nIn *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"Xiū zhī yú guó, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之于国，其德乃丰], *Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo* [解老] cites it as *\"xiū zhī bāng\"* [修之邦], hence its rhyme with *\"fēng\"* [丰]. Modern editions follow the **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] of *\"Gāo Dì\"* [高帝] by altering it to *\"guó\"* [国].\n\n**Máo’s** *Gǔjīn tōngyùn* [古今通韵] mistakenly claims *\"guó\"* [国] has a *\"gōng\"* [工] pronunciation, revealing such a profound misinterpretation that other convoluted theories are hardly worth refuting!\n\n**Jiāng Yǒu** [Jiāng Yǒu] states: The **Hán Dynasty** [汉] often altered texts to avoid taboo words. For instance, in *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"xiū zhī bāng\"* [修之邦], *\"bāng\"* [邦] was changed to *\"guó\"* [国] to avoid the **Emperor Gāozu** [高祖] taboo. In *Shǐjì* [史记], every instance of *\"qǐ\"* [启] was changed to *\"kāi\"* [开], avoiding the **Emperor Jǐng** [景帝] taboo. Thus, discrepancies in ancient rhymes may not always be errors but rather **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] alterations (General Overview of Ancient Rhymes).\n\n**Lǐ Qìnyún** [李赓芸] states: In the *Déjīng* [德经] of *Lǎozǐ* [老子], *\"Xiū zhī yú shēn, qí dé nǎi zhēn\"* [修之于身，其德乃真], these eight lines alternate in four rhyme schemes. *\"Guó\"* [国] was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦], rhyming with *\"fēng\"* [丰]. Additionally, in *Guǎnzǐ*’s *Mùmín* [牧民] chapter:\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng shēng, yuǎn zhě bù tīng\"* [毋曰不同生，远者不听],\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng xiāng, yuǎn zhě bù xíng\"* [毋曰不同乡，远者不行],\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng guó, yuǎn zhě bù cóng\"* [毋曰不同国，远者不从].\n*\"Guó\"* [国] is also the original *\"bāng\"* [邦], rhyming with *\"cóng\"* [从].\n\nThe **Hán Dynasty** [汉] altered *\"bāng\"* [邦] to *\"guó\"* [国] to avoid the **Emperor Gāozǔ** [高祖] taboo, and later generations, unaware of this correction, perpetuated the change until today.\n\n**Dèng Tíngzhēn** [邓廷桢] states: *\"Guó\"* [国] was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦]. The correct reading is *\"bāng\"* [邦], as *\"bāng\"* [邦] means **\"to enfeoff\"** [封]. The *Shū Xù* [书序] states: *\"Bāng Kāngzǔ, bāng zhūhóu\"* [邦康叔，邦诸侯], meaning **\"enfeoffing Kāngzǔ, enfeoffing the lords\"** [封康叔，封诸侯]. The *Lúnyǔ* [论语] says: *\"Qiě zài bāng yù zhī zhōng yǐ\"* [且在邦域之中矣], where *\"bāng yù\"* [邦域] refers to **\"enfeoffed territory\"** [封域]. Ancient pronunciation grouped *Dōng* [东], *Dōng* [冬], *Zhōng* [锺], and *Jiāng* [江] under the same department, with *\"bāng\"* [邦] pronounced as *\"bó gōng\"* [博工], precisely rhyming with *\"fēng\"* [丰] in this passage.\n\n---\nRegarding the manuscript variations:\n- The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] inscription has **87 characters**.\n- The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] manuscript has **84 characters** (character count follows **Wǔ Nèi** [武内], while **Luó Juàn** [罗卷] does not record this).\n- The *Hé Shàng* [河上] edition has **90 characters**.\n- **Wáng Bì**’s [王弼] edition has **91 characters**.\n- **Fù**’s and **Fàn**’s [傅、范] editions have **86 characters**.\n\n- The *Hé Shàng* [河上] edition titles this as *\"Xiū Guān dì wǔshísì\"* [修观第五十四].\n- **Wáng Bì**’s [王弼] edition titles this as *\"Wǔshísì zhāng\"* [五十四章].\n- **Fàn**’s [范] edition titles this as *\"Shàn Jiànzhě bù bá zhāng dì wǔshísì\"* [善建者不拔章第五十四], now recognized as the **54th Chapter** [五十四章].\n\nThe depth of **virtue/power** [德] is like that of a **赤子** [赤子]—a newborn babe.\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: The **Fù** [傅] edition reads, *\"The depth of **virtue/power** [德] is like that of a **赤子** [赤子].\"* The **Fàn** [范] edition omits the *\"the\"* [之] character. The **Hé Shàng** [河上] and **Wáng Bì** [王弼] editions omit *\"the\"* [者], *\"the\"* [之], and *\"also\"* [也]. This reading is also cited in **Zhāng Róng** [张湛]’s annotation of *Lièzǐ* [列子]’s *Tiān Ruì* [天瑞] chapter.\n\n*On the term* **\"赤子\" [赤子]**: The *Hàn Shū* [汉书]’s *Jiǎ Yì* [贾谊] biography, annotated by **Liú Fèngshì** [刘奉世], states: *\"An infant’s body is naturally red, hence it is called **赤子** [赤子].\"*\n\n**毒○不螫** [毒○不螫]: **Yán Kějūn** [严可均] notes that the **御注** [御注], **Hé Shàng** [河上], and **Gāo Yì** [高翿] editions read **\"毒虫不螫\" [毒虫不螫]**, while **Wáng Bì** [王弼]’s edition reads **\"蜂虿虺蛇不蛰\" [蜂虿虺蛇不蛰]**. The **\"○\"** [○] and **\"虺\" [虺]** characters are interchangeable, but the reading as **\"虫\" [虫]** is incorrect.\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: The **遂州** [遂州] and **Jǐngfú** [景福] editions follow this reading. The **Fànchí** [磻溪], **Lóuzhèng** [楼正], **Nǎijuàn** [柰卷], **Yán** [严], **Gù** [顾], **Péng** [彭], and **Zhào** [赵] editions align with the **御注** [御注], while the **Fàn** [范] edition matches **Wáng Bì** [王弼]. The **Fù** [傅] edition reads **\"蜂虿不螫\" [蜂虿不螫]**. **Bì Yuàn** [毕沅] suggests that **\"虿\" [虿]** should be **\"○\" [○]**, and **\"蜂\" [蜂]** should be **\"\" []**. The *Hàn Shū* [汉书] states, *\"If a **蝮** [蝮] snake bites a hand, the hand is cut off; if it bites a foot, the foot is cut off,\"*—this is the meaning of **\"螫\" [螫]**.\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines **\"螫\" [螫]** as **\"○\" [○]**, stating: *\"To bite.\"* Thus, these two characters share similar pronunciation and meaning.\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: The **Fù** [傅] edition correctly uses **\"攫\" [攫]**. The *Yù Biàn* [玉篇] defines **\"虫\" [虫]** as *\"also called **蝮** [蝮], this is the ancient form of **虺** [虺].\"* **\"虺\" [虺]** in modern times refers to venomous snakes, akin to **蝮** [蝮]. **\"蜂\" [蜂]** should be **\"\" []**. The *Zì Lín* [字林] states: *\"**** [], a flying insect that bites humans.\"* **\"螫\" [螫]** means *\"venomous bite.\"* The terms **\"虺蛇\" [虺蛇]** are redundant here and should be omitted, following the **碑本** [碑本] reading.\n\n**Yú Yì** [俞樾] notes: According to **Hé Shàng** [河上], the original text reads **\"毒虫不螫\" [毒虫不螫]**, with the annotation stating: *\"**蜂** [蜂], **虿** [虿], **蛇** [蛇], and **虺** [虺] do not bite.\"* These six characters are indeed part of **Hé Shàng**’s [河上] annotation. **Wáng Bì** [王弼]’s edition should also read **\"毒虫不螫\" [毒虫不螫]**, but later editors mistakenly incorporated the annotation into the text.\n\n**Jiāng Xīchāng** [蒋锡昌] states: **Wáng Bì**’s [王弼] annotation reads, *\"A **赤子** [赤子] has no desires or demands, and does not offend any creature, hence venomous insects do not bite humans.\"* Thus, **Wáng Bì** [王弼] uses **\"毒虫\" [毒虫]**. **Gù** [顾]’s *Chéng Shū* [成疏] and **Qiáng** [强]’s *Róng Zhù* [荣注] both read **\"毒虫\" [毒虫]**. The phrase **\"蜂虿虺蛇\" [蜂虿虺蛇]** should be revised to **\"毒虫\" [毒虫]** to restore the original text’s authenticity, as **Yú** [俞] suggests.\n\n**猛兽不据，鸷鸟不搏** [猛兽不据，鸷鸟不搏]:\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: **Wǔ Nèi Yìxióng** [武内义雄] notes that the **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌] manuscript reads **\"攫鸟猛狩不搏\" [攫鸟猛狩不搏]**, while the **遂本** [遂本] follows the **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌] reading, except that **\"狩\" [狩]** is replaced with **\"兽\" [兽]**.\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: The **Fàn** [范] edition aligns with the **遂本** [遂本], but **\"猛兽\" [猛兽]** precedes **\"攫鸟\" [攫鸟]**, and both omit **\"不据\" [不据]**. **Yán Zūn** [严遵]’s edition reads **\"攫鸟不搏，猛兽不据\" [攫鸟不搏，猛兽不据]**, reversing the order of the two sentences.\n\n**Mǎ Xùlún** [马叙伦] suggests that the text should read: *\"**猛兽不攫，鸷鸟不搏** [猛兽不攫，鸷鸟不搏].\"*\n\nThe *Huáinánzǐ* [淮南子]’s *Qí Sú* [齐俗] annotation states: *\"When birds are desperate, they strike; when beasts are desperate, they clutch.\"* The *Lǐjì* [礼记]’s *Rú Xíng* [儒行] chapter reads: *\"Fierce insects clutch and strike.\"* Both texts use **\"攫\" [攫]** and **\"搏\" [搏]** together, confirming their linkage. The characters **\"据\" [据]** and **\"攫\" [攫]** are visually similar but misused here, and the **\"鸷\" [鸷]** character is omitted.\n\n**Chéng Shū** [成疏] states: *\"**攫鸟** [攫鸟], such as hawks and falcons.\"* Hawks and falcons are indeed **鸷鸟** [鸷鸟].\n\nThe *Shuōyuàn* [说苑]’s *Xiū Wén* [修文] chapter states: *\"During times when yin and yang, heaven and earth flourish, fierce beasts do not clutch, wild birds do not strike, and venomous snakes do not bite.\"* This likely originates from the present passage, with **\"猛兽\" [猛兽]** and **\"鸷鸟\" [鸷鸟]** as parallel terms, and **\"攫\" [攫]** and **\"搏\" [搏]** as parallel actions, serving as a strong example.\n\n**Pān Zhèng** [潘正] reads: *\"**猛兽不攫，鸷鸟不搏** [猛兽不攫，鸷鸟不搏].\"*\n\n*As to the manuscript variations*: **Pān Jìngguān** [潘静观]’s edition incorrectly changes **\"据\" [据]** to **\"攫\" [攫]**, omitting the **\"不据\" [不据]** characters, which does not align with the **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌], **遂本** [遂本], or **Fàn** [范] editions.\n\n*On the characters*: The *Táng Xuànzōng* [唐玄宗]’s annotation of the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [道德真经]’s commentary, along with **Lǐ Yuē** [李约], **Lǐ Dàochún** [李道纯], **Dù Dàojiān** [杜道坚], **Qiáng Sīqí** [强思齐], and the **宋刊河上本** [宋刊河上本], all use **\"玃\" [玃]** instead of **\"攫\" [攫]**, which is an alternative form. The **Fù** [傅] edition correctly uses **\"攫\" [攫]**.\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines **\"攫\" [攫]** as *\"to grasp with claws.\"* The *Yǐqíng Shūnyì* [一切经音义] cites the *Cāngjǐ* [仓颉] text: *\"**攫** [攫], to strike.\"* It also references the *Huáinánzǐ* [淮南子], stating: *\"When beasts are desperate, they clutch.\"* **Gāo Yòu** [高诱]’s annotation reads: *\"Clutch, to seize.\"* All confirm the meaning of *\"to grasp with claws.\"*\n\n**\"攫鸟\" [攫鸟]**, such as hawks and falcons, is annotated by **Luó Juàn** [罗卷] as **\"○鸟\" [○鸟]** and by the **遂州本** [遂州本] as **\"○鸟\" [○鸟]**, both being vulgar forms. The *Xià Cún Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* [夏竦古文四声韵] Volume 5 contains the character **\"攫\" [攫]**, citing an ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text as **\"○\" [○]**; Volume 5 also contains the character **\"据\" [据]**, citing an ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text as **\"○\" [○]**. The **\"据\" [据]** character depicts two tigers grappling, hence its usage in this context.\n\n*According to* **Wáng Niànsūn**’s [王念孙] *Dùshū Zházì* [读书杂志] Volume 2: *\"In the *Zhàn Guó Cè* [战国策]’s *Chǔ Cè* [楚策], it reads: *'When Chu and Qin were at war, this is what is meant by two tigers grappling.'* **Yǐnzhī** [引之] states: The *Tàipíng Yùlǎn* [太平御览]’s *Bīngbù* [兵部] section cites this text, using **'据' [据]** instead of **'搏' [搏]**, which is correct. **'据'** is pronounced like **'jì'** [戟], meaning two tigers grappling each other. In the *Wénxuǎn* [文选], **Jiāng Yān** [江淹]’s *Zá Shī* [杂诗] reads: *'In the dark, the tigers grapple,'*—**Lǐ Shàn** [李善]’s annotation cites this text, particularly confirming **'据' [据]** as the correct character. The *Shǐjì* [史记]’s *Zhāng Yí* [张仪] biography also contains this passage, with the *Jìjiě* [集解] citing **Xú Guǎng** [徐广]’s annotation: *'Pronounced like **'jì'** [戟]'*—this is precisely the pronunciation of **'据' [据]**.*\"\n\nLaozi states, *\"Fierce beasts do not grapple, snatching birds do not strike.\"* The *Yán Tiě Lùn* [盐铁论]’s *Jī Zhī* [击之] chapter remarks, *\"Tigers and rhinoceroses clash, yet ants thrive.\"* These are further confirmations.\n\nThe current *Shǐjì* [史记] text reads *\"two tigers grappling\"*—clearly later scholars, having heard *\"strike\"* [搏] more often than *\"grapple\"* [据], altered *\"grapple\"* to *\"strike.\"* If the *Shǐjì* and *Zhàn Guó Cè* [战国策] may be emended from *\"grapple\"* to *\"strike\"*, then it is equally evident that *Huáinán* [淮南] and *Shuōyuàn* [说苑] should be emended from *\"grapple\"* to *\"snatch\"* [攫]. This should follow the stele text, retaining *\"grapple\"* [据] as correct.\n\n**Bone frail, sinew soft, yet grip unyielding.**\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes: The *\"○\"* should follow other versions as *\"sinew\"* [筋].\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] states: *\"Sinew: from *strength* [力], resembling sinew.\"*\n\nTián Qián [田潜] says: *\"Strength\"* [力] is sinew, depicting the form of human sinew; bamboo, being abundant in sinew, is written with *strength* to represent its form.\n\nNow examining *\"sinew\"* [筋], the *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions all read *\"○\"*, while the *Yùzhù* [御注], *Héshàng* [河上], *Wáng Xīzhī* [王羲之], and *Zhào Mèngfǔ* [赵孟俯] versions read *\"\"*, all being vulgar characters.\nLù Démíng [陆德明] states: *\"\"* is vulgar.\nThe *Jiǔ Jīng Zìyàng* [九经字样] says: *\"\"* is a corrupted vulgar form, also written as *\"觔\"*, which is incorrect.\n\n**Unknowing of male-female union, the *○* acts.**\nYán Kějūn [严可均] notes: *\"While ○ acts\"*, Wáng Bī [王弼] writes *\"while all acts\"*.\nThe *Shìwén* [释文] cites *Héshàng* [河上] as *\"○\"*, with one version as *\"脧\"* [脧].\n*\"The utmost of essence\"*, *Héshàng* and Wáng Bī [王弼] add *\"also\"* after *\"utmost\"*, as does the following sentence.\n\nWèi Jiàosūn [魏稼孙] says: *\"While ○ acts\"*, the original text leaves a blank after *\"while\"*, and Yán Kějūn [严可均] arbitrarily adds *\"○\"*. The *Yùzhù* [御注] is erroneous.\n\nLuó Zhènyù [罗振玉] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions also read *\"○\"*.\n*\"The utmost of essence also\"*, the *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Yùzhù* [御注], and *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] versions omit *\"also\"*, as does the following *\"The utmost of harmony also\"*.\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes: The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Nàijuàn* [柰卷], Yán [严], Gù [顾], Péng [彭], Wáng Xīzhī [王羲之], and Zhào Mèngfǔ [赵孟俯] versions all read *\"○\"*, while Fù [傅] and Fàn [范] read *\"朘\"* [朘], and Gāo Dì [高翿] reads *\"○\"* [○].\nFàn Yìngyuán [范应元] says: *\"脧\"* [脧], matching Fù Yì [傅奕] and ancient texts, but modern versions mostly read *\"○\"*. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] annotates *\"朘\"* as also written *\"○\"*, *\"○\"*, with all three characters used interchangeably, pronounced *zǐléi* [子雷], meaning *\"red child\"* [赤子] in the *yīn* [阴] category.\n\nYú Yì [俞樾] states: Regarding *\"while all acts\"*, the meaning of *\"all\"* [全] remains unclear.\n\n「Wáng Zhù [王注] states: *\"○, meaning 'long' [长], as there is nothing to harm its body, hence it can attain fullness and growth [全长].\"*\n\nThis interpretation is highly questionable. The *Héshàng* [河上] version reads *\"○\"* for *\"全\"*, yet its annotation states: *\"The red child [赤子] does not yet know the union of male and female [男女之合会], and when the yin [阴] arises in anger, it is due to the abundance of vital essence and qi [精气多之所致].\"* Thus, *\"○\"* is explained through the character *\"阴\"*.\n\nThe *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] under the \"flesh\" radical [肉部] says: *\"○, the red child’s yin [赤子阴].\"* *\"○\"* is indeed *\"朘\"* [朘]. It is suspected that the original text Wáng Zhù [王注] relied upon had *\"全\"* [全] as a mistake for *\"○\"* [○]. *\"○\"* is the genuine character for *\"阴\"* [阴]...\n\nIn the ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] manuscripts, *\"○\"* [○] likely follows the old script form, while the clerical script sometimes renders it as *\"○\"* [○]. The *Wǔliángcí* [武梁祠] inscriptions, where the character *\"阴\"* [阴] is depicted with a left side of *\"○\"* [○], confirms this. When *\"○\"* [○] is worn or damaged, only its upper half remains, making it resemble *\"全\"* [全], hence the confusion.\n\nThus, the reading *\"○\"* [○] reflects the original *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text, *\"全\"* [全] is an erroneous substitution for *\"○\"* [○], and *\"○\"* [○] is a variant form. Wáng Zhù [王注] based his annotation on the mistaken reading and failed to correct it, thereby obscuring the original *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text—this is regrettable.\n\nYì Shùndìng [易顺鼎] says: According to the *Shìwén* [释文], *\"The Héshàng* [河上] version also reads *‘脧’* [脧].\"* It further cites the *Shuōwén* [说文]: *\"脧, the red child’s yin [赤子阴].\"* However, the *Shuōwén* [说文] does not contain the character *\"脧\"* [脧], suggesting that the Tang-era [唐本] version included it. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] also states *\"脧, the red child’s yin [赤子阴]\"*, aligning with the original meaning of the *Shuōwén* [说文]. This implies that the *Shuōwén* [说文] collected *\"朘\"* [朘] as derived from *Lǎozǐ* [老子]. Since *\"朘\"* [朘] and *\"全\"* [全] have similar pronunciations, *\"全\"* was sometimes borrowed as a substitute.\n\nWáng Zhù’s [王注] error lies in interpreting the character based solely on its appearance, unaware that *\"全\"* [全] was a borrowed form for *\"朘\"* [朘].\n\nHóng Yìxiàn [洪颐烜] states: The *Shuōwén* [说文] does not include *\"朘\"* [朘]. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] says: *\"朘, the red child’s yin [赤子阴]. Also written as ○ [○], and in some phonetic categories as ○ [○].\"* The *Shuōwén* [说文] also lacks *\"○\"* [○], which is likely a corrupted form of *\"○\"* [○]. The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"○\"* [○] as: *\"A covering, resembling skin wrapped around, with two arms beneath, and the character *夕* [夕] at the bottom, pronounced like *Fàn* [范].\"* In the *Suìwén Liù Jié Zàngxiàng Lùn* [素问六节藏象论], it states: *\"All marrow [髓] belongs to the brain [脑]\"*, which aligns with the following *\"The utmost of vital essence [精之至].\"* This meaning is also consistent.\n\nZhāng Bǐnglín [章炳麟] says: In *Lǎozǐ* [老子], *\"Before knowing the union of male and female, the red child’s yin [○] arises\"*, and the *Shìwén* [释文] states: *\"○, the red child’s yin [赤子阴], pronounced *zǐchuí* [子垂].\"* The *Sānjiā* [三州] (likely referring to the *Lǐngwài Sānjiā* [岭外三州]) defines the red child’s yin as *\"○\"* [○]. The child cries all day without its voice faltering, reaching the utmost harmony [和之至].\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes: *\"Cries all day without its voice faltering\"* [号而不嗄]—Yán Kějūn [严可均] says: *\"Gāo Dì [高翿] has the character *‘嗌’* [嗌] beneath *‘而’* [而].\"* The versions of Yán [严], Péng [彭], Fù [傅], Fàn [范], Wáng Xīzhī [王羲之], Zhào Mèngfǔ [赵孟俯], and *Pánxī* [磻溪] all include *\"嗌\"* [嗌]. *\"号\"* [号] is written as *\"嗥\"* [嗥] by Yán [严]. *\"嗄\"* [嗄] is rendered as *\"哑\"* [哑] in the *Héshàng* [河上] and *Nàijuàn* [柰卷] versions, *\"○\"* [○] by Fù [傅], and *\"嚘\"* [嚘] by Yán [严].\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子]’s *Gēngsāng Cǔ* [庚桑楚] section states: *\"The child cries all day without its voice faltering [儿子终日嗥而嗌不嗄], reaching the utmost harmony [和之至].\"* The *Shìwén* [释文] says: *\"‘嗥’* [嗥] is also written as *‘号’* [号]. ‘嗄’* [嗄] is also written as *‘嚘’* [嚘].\"* The ancient manuscript versions correctly read *\"儿子终日号而嗌不嚘\"* [儿子终日号而嗌不嚘], likely derived from *Lǎozǐ* [老子]. *\"嗌\"* [嗌] is a Qin [秦] and Jin [晋] dialect term, and Lǐ Yì [李颐] says: *\"‘嗌’* [嗌] is pronounced *è* [厄], meaning ‘to choke’ [噎].\"* Yáng Xiōng’s [扬雄] *Fāngyán* [方言] states: *\"‘厮’* [厮] (pronounced *sī* [斯]) and *‘嗌’* [嗌] (pronounced *è* [恶介]), both mean ‘to choke’ [噎] (all referring to throat pain, pronounced *yè* [翳]). The Chu [楚] say *‘嘶’* [嘶], while Qin [秦] and Jin [晋] sometimes say *‘嗌’* [嗌], or *‘噎’* [噎].\"* Since *Lǎozǐ* [老子] was a Chu [楚] person, he should use Chu [楚] language.\n\nChéng Xuànyīng’s [成玄英] annotation says: *\"The red child cries all day without its voice faltering [终日啼号而声不嘶嗄], as it lacks a mind to alter its sound, and its harmonious qi [和气] does not disperse.\"*\n\nThe text of the version Chéng Xuànyīng [成玄英] saw likely reads *\"终日号而嘶不嗄\"* [终日号而嘶不嗄]. Péng Dì’s [彭耜] *Shìwén* [释文] states: *\"‘嗌’* [嗌] means ‘throat’ [咽]. Huáng Máocái [黄茂材] says: ‘The ancient versions lack the character *‘嗌’* [嗌]. The phrase *‘嗌不嗄’* [嗌不嗄] is from *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], and later people added it to *Lǎozǐ*’s [老子] text, which is not adopted today.’\"* Additionally, *\"嗄\"* [嗄] is also written as *\"噫\"* [噫] or *\"哑\"* [哑]. Lù Démíng [陆德明] says: *\"‘而声不嗄’* [而声不嗄] should be read as *‘噫’* [噫].\"* The *Dàozàng* [道藏]’s *Zhāng Tàishǒu* [张太守]’s collection of four commentaries states: *\"The *Bì* [弼] version reads *‘噫’* [噫].\"* It further cites *Bì* [弼] as saying: *\"Without the mind of contention and desire [无争欲之心], hence it cries all day without faltering [不噫].\"*\n\nThis indicates that Wáng Zhù’s [王注] original text read *\"噫\"* [噫]. *\"噫\"* [噫], *\"yì\"* [欭], *\"yē\"* [噎], and *\"嚘\"* [嚘] are all variations of the same sound. Yán’s [严] version reads *\"嚘\"* [嚘], aligning with *\"终日号而不嚘\"* [终日号而不嚘], as noted in the *Yùpiàn* [玉篇]. The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"嚘\"* [嚘] as *\"the appearance of an undecided speech.\"* Yáng Xiōng’s [扬雄] *Tàixuàn Yí* [太玄夷] states: *\"The third softness in sequence: the infant’s cry, for three days without faltering [婴儿于号，三日不嚘]. Zhì [测] says: the infant’s cry, as its mind is harmonious [中心和].\"* This passage originates from *Lǎozǐ* [老子]. *\"嚘\"* [嚘], composed of the radicals *\"mouth\"* [口] and *\"worry\"* [忧], resembles *\"嗄\"* [嗄] in form and is close in meaning, with *\"嗄\"* [嗄] likely being the original character.\n\nSīmǎ Biāo’s [司马彪] annotation in *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子]’s *Gēngsāng Cǔ* [庚桑楚] states: *\"The Chu [楚] term for utter silence is *‘嗄’* [嗄].\"* Since *Lǎozǐ* [老子] was a Chu [楚] person, he used Chu [楚] dialect, and thus *\"嗌\"* [嗌] in Qin [秦] and Jin [晋] would also be rendered as *\"嗄\"* [嗄] or *\"噎\"* [噎].\n\nThe character *\"噎\"* [yē] carries the meaning of *\"worry.\"*\n\nLiu Duānlín’s [刘端临] *Jīngchuán Xiǎojì* [经传小记] states:\n*\"噎\"* [yē] means *\"worry.\"* In the *Shī* [诗], *\"Centered like noise\"* [中心如噎], the *Zhuàn* [传] says: *\"Noise—worry that cannot be stilled.\"* *\"噎\"* [yē] and *\"忧\"* [yōu] are rhyming words. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] cites *\"The Shī: ‘Centered like noise,’ meaning noise—worry that cannot be stilled,\"* adding the word *\"meaning\"* [谓], most accurately capturing Máo Qí’s [毛奇] intent. *\"噎忧\"* [yēyōu] is the same as *\"欭嚘\"* [yìngōng], meaning *\"reversed qi.\"* The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"欭\"* [yì] as *\"worry.\"* The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] annotates *\"嚘\"* [gōng] as: *\"Lǎozǐ [老子] says: ‘All day crying yet not 嚘.’ 嚘 means reversed qi, also written as ○.\"* The *Guǎngyùn* [广韵] states: *\"欭 [yì], sighing in worry. ○, reversed qi.\"* *\"噎\"* [yē], *\"噫\"* [yī], *\"欭\"* [yì], and *\"忧\"* [yōu] are variations of the same sound.\n\nBy examining Liu’s observations, Wáng Niǎnsūn’s [王念孙] *Fāngyán Shūzhèng Bǔ* [方言疏证补] (from the *Gāoyóu Wángshì Yíshū* [高邮王氏遗书], Vol. 3) cites it, declaring: *\"This truly unifies the intent of Máo’s commentary and dialectal usage.\"* Now, based on this, we correct *Lǎozǐ* [老子], knowing that *\"号而嘶不嗄\"* [háo ér sī bù shà] should have *\"嗄\"* [shà] as the original text, which later evolved into *\"嚘\"* [gōng], then *\"○\"* [yī], and further transformed into *\"噫\"* [yī], and finally *\"哑\"* [yǎ]—all being dialectal variations.\n\nYì Shùndǐng [易顺鼎] says:\n*\"According to *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], *Gēngsāng Cǔ* [庚桑楚], it states: ‘All day crying yet not 嗌 [shà] not 嗄 [shà].’ This is the original text of *Lǎozǐ* [老子], closer to antiquity than *Tàixuàn* [太玄] or *Yùpiàn* [玉篇]. 嗄 [shà] is the same as the ‘charcoal tongue made mute’ [舌炭为哑] in *Shǐjì* [史记], *Cìkè Zhuan* [刺客传]. The *Suǒyǐn* [索隐] states: ‘哑 [yǎ], a speech impediment.’ This chapter rhymes with 螫 [shì], 据 [jù], 搏 [bó], 固 [gù], 作 [zuò], 嗄 [shà], all ancient phonetic rhymes. If written as 嚘 [gōng], there would be no rhyme. The *Shìwén Jiězhu* [释文] states: ‘嗄 [shà], one reads as *mài* [迈], another as *yújiè* [于介].’ The pronunciation is incorrect.\"*\n\nZhāng Bǐnglín [章炳麟] says:\n*\"Sīmǎ Biāo [司马彪] states: ‘The Chu [楚] term for utter silence is 嗄 [shà].’ Today, 嗄 [shà] commonly refers to those unable to speak, and utter silence is also called 嗄 [shà], often borrowed as 哑 [yǎ]. 哑 [yǎ] originally means ‘laughter,’ as in *Yì* [易]: ‘Laughing speech, 哑哑 [yǎyǎ].’ Yet, the *Shǐjì* [史记], *Cìkè Lièzhuan* [刺客列传], already uses ‘swallowed into mute’ [吞为哑], showing its long-standing usage as a borrowed character.\"* (*Xīn Fāngyán* [新方言], Vol. 4)\n\nFrom this, we know *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is a borrowed character, with *\"嗄\"* [shà] as the original. *\"嗄\"* [shà] and *\"哑\"* [yǎ] are the same character, so *Héshàng* [河上] and *Nǎi* [柰] volumes use *\"哑\"* [yǎ]. However, *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is a later character. To restore *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s ancient text, we should follow the stele inscription’s *\"嗄\"* [shà]. Writing it as *\"嚘\"* [gōng], *\"○\"* [yī], *\"噫\"* [yī], or *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is incorrect.\n\n---\n*\"Knowing harmony as constant, knowing constancy as clarity, augmenting life as auspicious, directing qi by the heart as strength.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn [严可均] states: *\"Knowing constancy as clarity\"* [知常曰明], the *Héshàng* [河上] version reads *\"日明\"* [rìmíng], and the same applies to the following two sentences.\n\nBùnài Yìyǒng [武内义雄] notes that in the *\"augmenting life as auspicious\"* [益生曰祥] passage, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] manuscript preserved by Luó Zhènyù [罗振玉] reads *\"详\"* [xiáng].\n\nUpon examination, *\"祥\"* [xiáng] is a borrowed character for *\"牂\"* [zāng], synonymous with *\"壮\"* [zhuàng], aligning with the *\"物壮则老\"* [wùzhuàngzélǎo] *\"壮\"* [zhuàng] below. My note: Luó Zhènyù’s [罗振玉] *Kǎoyì* [考异] did not account for this. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] edition confirms *\"详\"* [xiáng], while Luó failed to correct it. The *Suì* [遂] edition lacks the *\"Knowing constancy as clarity\"* [知常曰明] sentence.\n\nThe word *\"曰\"* [yuē], in *Jǐngfú* [景福] and *Nǎi* [柰] volumes, is written as *\"日\"* [rì] for all three following sentences. The *Shìtōng* [室町] edition writes *\"日\"* [rì] for the last three sentences but *\"曰\"* [yuē] for the first.\n\nThe character *\"强\"* [qiáng], in *Lóuzhèng* [楼正] and *Wǔnèi Dūnhuáng* [武内敦煌] editions, is *\"强\"* [qiáng], while Fù Yì [傅奕]’s *\"曰强\"* [yuēqiáng] reads *\"则强\"* [zéqiáng].\n\nAdditionally, *\"益生曰祥\"* [yìshēngyuēxiáng], Lǐ Dàochún [李道纯]’s version reads *\"益生不祥\"* [yìshēngbùxiáng]. The *Dàodé Huìyuán Xùlì* [道德会元序例] states: *\"‘益生不祥’ is sometimes written as ‘日祥’ or ‘曰祥,’ both incorrect.\"* Lǐ’s [李] edition, based on *Héshàng Zhàngrén Zhāngjù Báiběn* [河上丈人章句白本], is logically sound.\n\nIn *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], *Déchōng Fú* [德充符]: *\"Constantly following nature without augmenting life.\"* Augmenting life contradicts *Lǎozǐ*’s [老子] *\"generative generosity\"* [生生之厚], acting against spontaneity—thus, *\"not auspicious\"* [不祥].\n\nThe phrase *\"不祥\"* [bùxiáng] appears three times in the text: Chapter 31 *\"佳兵者不祥之器\"* [jiābīngzhébùxiángzhīqì], *\"兵者不祥之器\"* [bīngzhébùxiángzhīqì], and Chapter 78 *\"受国不祥\"* [shòuguóbùxiáng]. Only here does it appear as *\"祥\"* [xiáng], which is questionable. *\"祥\"* [xiáng] carries the meaning of *\"omen\"* or *\"portent.\"* Lǐ Qí [李奇] states: *\"Internal portents are called *‘shèng’* [眚], external portents are called *‘xiáng’* [祥].\"* The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] defines *\"祥\"* [xiáng] as *\"portentous omens.\"* Thus, *\"祥\"* [xiáng] is synonymous with *\"不祥\"* [bùxiáng].\n\nThe *Dàodé Jīng*’s *Qǔshàn Jíyǐn* [取善集引] cites Sūn Dēng [孙登]: *\"Generative generosity, when acted upon, becomes a portentous omen.\"* This aligns with the passage.\n\nYì Shùndǐng [易顺鼎] states: *\"‘祥’* [xiáng] is the same as *‘不祥’* [bùxiáng]. The *Shū* [书] *Xù* [序] says: ‘There was an auspicious *xiáng* [祥]—the *sāng* [桑] and *gǔ* [谷] trees grew together in the morning,’ where *xiáng* [祥] shares the same meaning. Wáng Bì’s [王弼] annotation states: ‘Life cannot be augmented; augmenting it leads to decline.’ The character *‘夭’* [yāo] should be *‘妖’* [yāo], interpreting *‘xiáng’* [xiáng] as *‘妖’* [yāo].\"* My note: The *Dàozàng* [道藏] *Zhāng Tàishǒu Huìkè Sìjiā Zhù* [张太守汇刻四家注] cites Wáng Bì [王弼] as writing *\"妖\"* [yāo].\n\nMǎ Xùlún [马叙伦] states: *\"The *Héshàng* [河上] annotation says: ‘If one knows the constant Dao and acts accordingly, one’s understanding will daily grow clearer toward the mysterious.’\"* Thus, *Héshàng* [河上] also writes *\"日明\"* [rìmíng].\n\nChéng Shū states: *\"Excessive greed for worldly gain and excessive augmentation of life are what give rise to daily proliferation of afflictions and entanglements.\"* He further says: *\"Thus, the karmic causes of birth and death grow ever stronger each day.\"* This confirms that Chéng’s *\"rìxiáng\"* [日祥] should be *\"rìxiáng\"* [曰祥].\n\nMǎ Xùlún argues that *\"rì\"* [日] is a mistaken transcription for *\"yuē\"* [曰], as *\"yuē\"* [曰] and *\"zé\"* [则] are interchangeable. My note: The reading *\"yuē\"* [曰] is correct. The *Húinán Dàoyīng Xiàn* [淮南道应训] and *Wénzǐ Xià Dé Piān* [文子下德篇] both cite it as *\"yuē\"* [曰], and this should be followed. Liú Wéndiǎn’s *Sānyú Zházhì* (卷一) claims *\"yuē\"* [曰] should be *\"rì\"* [日], mistaken due to similar shapes, but this is incorrect, as the *Héshàng* text here proves otherwise.\n\nMǎ Xùlún further states: *\"Qì\"* [气] should be *\"qì\"* [气], and *\"qiáng\"* [强] is borrowed as *\"jiāng\"* [僵]. In the *Zhuāngzǐ Jiéyáng Piān* [庄子则阳篇], *\"tuī ér qiáng zhī\"* [推而强之] is cited in the *Yù Piān* [玉篇] as *\"jiāng\"* [僵], providing the precedent.\n\nIn *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhuāngzǐ*, the term *\"qì\"* [气] often surpasses *\"xīn\"* [心] in meaning, as seen in *Zhuāngzǐ Rénjiānshì Piān* [庄子人间世篇]:\n*\"Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the heart; do not listen with the heart, but listen with the *qì* [气]. The *qì* [气] is the empty vessel that awaits things.\"* In *Yìng Dìwáng* [应帝王], it states: *\"Let your mind dwell in serenity, and harmonize your *qì* [气] with emptiness.\"* In this text, *\"zhuāng qì zhì róu\"* [专气致柔] and *\"chōng qì yǐwéi hé\"* [冲气以为和] all follow this usage. Thus, *\"xīn shǐ qì yuē jiāng\"* [心使气曰僵] is correct.\n\nYú Yì states: *\"Below this passage, the original text originally included the lines: ‘Thus, using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.’ Later commentators omitted them, having already appeared in Chapter 52.\"* The *Húinán Dàoyīng Piān* [淮南道应篇] cites *Lǎozǐ* as saying: *\"Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity; augmenting life is called *xiáng* [祥]; the heart directing *qì* [气] is called *qiáng* [强]. Thus, using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.\"* This confirms that the ancient text originally contained these two lines.\n\nMoreover, *\"Using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity\"* clearly illustrates the idea that things cannot remain perpetually vigorous. Hence, the following passage states: *\"When vigor peaks, decay follows—this is called *bùdào* [不道]; *bùdào* [不道] brings early demise.\"* If these two lines are omitted, the meaning disconnects from what follows.\n\nThe *Wénzǐ Xià Dé Piān* [文子下德篇] states: *\"Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity; augmenting life is called *xiáng* [祥]; the heart directing *qì* [气] is called *qiáng* [强]. This is called *Xuántóng* [玄同]; using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.\"* It also includes the subsequent two lines: *\"When vigor peaks, decay follows—this is called *bùdào* [不道]; *bùdào* [不道] brings early demise.\"* Yán Kějūn states: *\"This is called *bùdào* [不道]\"* is annotated in the *Yùzhù* [御注] and *Gāoxì* [高翿] as *\"Shìwèi bùdào\"* [是谓不道]. Luó Zhènyù notes that in the *Dūnjiāng* [敦煌] manuscripts, both *\"bù\"* [不] are written as *\"fēi\"* [非]. My note: The reading *\"bù\"* [不] is correct. *\"Zǎoyǐ\"* [早已] should be *\"zǎowáng\"* [早亡], as explained in Chapter 30. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] and *Gù* [顾] editions write *\"fēi\"* [非] for *\"bù\"* [不], while the *Yán* [严] edition writes *\"fēi\"* [非] in the first instance and *\"bù\"* [不] in the second. The *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Péng* [彭], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Zhào* [赵] editions all follow the stone text. Wáng Xīzhī writes *\"shìwèi\"* [是谓] instead of *\"wèi\"* [谓之], while *Héshàng* [河上] writes *\"wù zhuàng zé lǎo\"* [物壮则老] as *\"wù zhuàng jiāng lǎo\"* [物壮将老], and *Guāngmíng* [广明] writes *\"zǎoyǐ\"* [早已] as *\"zǎoyǐ\"* [早以]. The *Tàisū* [太素] Volume 3 also cites these three lines identically.\n\n**[Phonology]** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading for this chapter:\n*Shì* [螫], *jù* [据], *bó* [搏], *gù* [固], *zuò* [作], *shà* [嗄] (Fish department, *shì* as *shù*, *bó* as *bù*, *zuò* as *zǔ*, *shà* as *shū* with a falling tone).\n*Cháng* [常], *míng* [明], *xiáng* [祥], *qiáng* [强] (Yang department),\n*Lǎo* [老], *dào* [道], *yǐ* [已] (Zhi and Yu departments, *lǎo* as *lùshòu*, *yǐ* as *yǒuyǔ*).\n\nMy note: *Lǎo* [老] and *dào* [道] belong to the Yu department, while *yǐ* [已] belongs to the Zhi department, thus forming a *zhī-yōu* [之幽] rhyme. Yáo Wéntián and Dèng Tíngzhēn agree, except they write *\"shà\"* [嗄] as *\"yǎ\"* [哑] and omit the rhyme for *\"yǐ\"* [已]. Gāo Běn Hàn states that *\"shì\"* [螫] should be *\"shè\"* [赦], making *shè* [赦], *bó* [搏], *zuò* [作] rhyme with *jù* [据] and *gù* [固].\n\nGǔ Yánwù’s *Tángyùn Zhèng* (Volume 22, *Xī* [昔]): *\"Shì\"* [螫] in the falling tone is pronounced as *shè* [赦]. Volume 19, *Du* [铎]: *\"Bó\"* [搏] in the falling tone is pronounced as *fú* [甫], and in the citation of this *Lǎozǐ* passage, it is pronounced as *jùgù* [故反], while *\"shà\"* [嗄] is pronounced as *hù* [户]. Jiāng Yǒuguò’s *Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng* (Volume 22, *Xī* [昔]) states: *\"Shì\"* [螫], pronounced as *shìzhǐ* [施只].\n\nAccording to ancient usage, the falling and entering tones were interchangeable in rhyme. In *Lǎozǐ*, it states: *\"Fierce beasts do not *jù* [据], grasping birds do not *bó* [搏]; though bones are weak and sinews supple, their grip is firm.\"* Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *\"Shì\"* [螫], *\"jù\"* [据], *\"bó\"* [搏], *\"gù\"* [固], *\"zuò\"* [作], *\"shà\"* [嗄] form a rhyme. I note that *\"tuán\"* [抟] should be *\"bó\"* [搏]. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines *\"bó\"* [搏] as *\"seizing and holding.\"* The *Zhōulǐ Shèrén* [周礼射人] annotation for *\"lífǒu\"* [狸首] states: *\"The weasel is skilled at holding, and ‘holding’ is the same as ‘bó’ [搏].\"* The *Húinánzǐ* [淮南子] says: *\"When birds are cornered, they *bó* [搏]; when beasts are cornered, they *jué* [攫].\"* This is its meaning. The *Zhōulǐ Huánrén* [周礼环人] states: *\"Bó tièzéi\"* [搏谍贼], and the *Jīngdiǎn Shìwén* [经典释文] annotates *\"bó\"* [搏] as *fángbù* [房布], belonging to the Yu department. This confirms its pronunciation. Since the entire passage above and below uses the Yu rhyme, this single line should not lack it—only *\"bó\"* [搏] makes the rhyme consistent.\n\nAdditionally, the *Ēryá* [尔雅] states: *\"Juéfù shàn gù\"* [攫父善顾], and Guō Xiànzhě’s annotation says: *\"One who is skilled at seizing and holding others, and good at glancing around.\"*\n\n「攫」 in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* is defined as *\"the large mother monkey, skilled at seizing and holding others.\"*\n\nThe passage here, in its meaning, speaks of how poisonous insects are skilled at stinging (*shì* [螫]) yet do not sting, fierce beasts are skilled at seizing (*jù* [据]) yet do not seize, birds skilled at *bó* [搏] yet do not *bó*, and thus the sense also aligns.\n\nAgain, the character 「作」 was pronounced in ancient times like *zuò* [阼], *zì* [胙].\n\nThe *Yu* rhyme group’s ancient pronunciation was in the *Gòng* [御] department, though the *Shuōwén Jiězì* has no 「嗄」 character. The *Guǎngyuàn* [广韵] cites 「嗄」 from the *Lǎozǐ* [老子]: *\"终日号而不嗄\"*, annotated as *\"the voice does not change.\"* The *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] says of *Gēngsāng Chǔ* [庚桑楚]: *\"终日嗥而嗌不嗄\"*, matching this text. Thus, the *Lǎozǐ* originally had 「嗄」, rhyming with *shì* [螫], *jù* [据], *bó* [搏], *gù* [固], and 「作」.\n\nFù Yì [傅奕] emended the *Lǎozǐ* to read 「不○」; the *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] cites 「嚘」 in this passage as 「不嚘」, annotated as *\"the qi is obstructed.\"* Both variations stem from not recognizing 「嗄」 as a character belonging to the *Yu* rhyme group, leading to divergent readings.\n\nAdditionally, the *Lǎo* [老] and *Dào* [道] characters form a rhyme, both belonging to the *Yōu* [幽] department’s upper tone. 「老」 in ancient pronunciation was in the *Yōu* [黝] department: it rhymes with 「手」 in the *Shījì* [击鼓], with 「酒」 in *Nǚyuē* [女曰], with 「雠」, 「犹」, and 「丑」 in *Cǎiqí* [采芑], and with 「首」 in *Xiǎobiàn* [小弁]. In *Pànshuǐ* [泮水], it rhymes with 「○」, 「酒」, 「道」, and 「丑」.\n\nThe *Jīngdìng Shìwén* [景龙碑本] has **77 characters**, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本] **75**, the *Héshàng* [河上] **79**, the *Wáng* [王本] **81**, the *Fù* [傅本] **83**, and the *Fàn* [范本] **82**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* [河上] titles this as *\"Chapter of Mysterious Harmony, the Fifty-Fifth\"* (玄符第五十五), the *Wáng* [王本] as *\"Chapter Fifty-Five\"* (五十五章), and the *Fàn* [范本] as *\"Chapter of the Depth of Virtue, the Fifty-Fifth\"* (含德之厚章第五十五).\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù* [傅本] and *Fàn* [范本] both append 「也」 after 「不言」 and 「不知」. The *Héshàng* [河上公], *Wáng* [王弼], and other versions, as well as the annotations in *Lǐhuò Lùn* [理惑论], *Wénxuǎn* [文选]’s *Wèi Dū Fù* [魏都赋], and *Yùnmìng Lùn* [运命论], all omit these two 「也」 characters. *Fǔxíng Jì* [辅行记] also cites the same, but changes 「者」 to 「则」. The *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] in *Tiāndào Piān* [天道篇] states: *\"则知者不言，言者不知.\"* In *Zhīběi Yóu Piān* [知北游篇]: *\"夫知者不言，言者不知.\"* Both passages derive from this text and also lack 「也」.\n\nSeal its *yuè* [兑], close its gate, blunt its sharpness, disperse its wrath, harmonize its brilliance, and blend its dust—this is called *Mystic Uniformity* (玄同).\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: In the *Héshàng* [河上] version, 「解其忿」 is written as 「纷」, while *Wáng* [王弼] renders it as 「分」.\n\n*Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本], *Jǐngfú* [景福本], and *Suì* [遂本] all use 「忿」, likely because 「纷」 is a borrowed character for 「忿」.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Jǐngfú* [景福本], *Yán Zūn* [严遵], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] also use 「忿」, while *Qíng Xuán* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷], *Gù Huān* [顾欢], *Péng* [彭], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Zhào* [赵] render it as 「纷」. The *Lǚlùn* [吕览]’s *Shèn Dà Piān* [慎大篇] annotates 「纷纷分分」 as *\"fear and resentment\"*, likely considering 「分」 a contracted form of 「棼」. The *Shìwén Jiězì* [释文] for *Zuǒyǐn Sìchuán* [左隐四传] defines 「棼」 as *\"chaos\"*. *Wáng* [王本]’s 「解其分」 means to disperse its disorder. The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本], *Jǐngfú* [景福本], and *Suì* [遂本] all use 「忿」. The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅]’s *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines 「忿」 as *\"anger\"*. The *Yì Xiàngtuán* [易象传] states: *\"The virtuous one restrains anger and checks desires.\"* The *Chūcí* [楚辞]’s *Huáishā* [怀沙] uses 「惩改忿兮」, annotated as *\"resentment\"*, where 「改忿」 also means 「解其忿」—both interpretations are consistent.\n\n*Yì Shùndīng* [易顺鼎] says: These six lines have already appeared earlier; likely they are a repetition. The four lines of 「挫其锐」 match the *Shàng Piān* [上篇]’s *Dìsì Piān* [第四章], suggesting this annotation may also belong to the *Shàng Piān*’s *Dìsì Piān*. Both annotations in *Wénxuǎn* [文选]’s *Wèi Dū Fù* [魏都赋] and *Yùnmìng Lùn* [运命论] cite only the *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s line: *\"知者不言，言者不知，是谓玄同\"*, without these six lines, confirming their duplication.\n\n---\nThus, it cannot be approached with excessive familiarity, nor can it be avoided with excessive distance;\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: Before 「不可得而疏」, the *Héshàng* [河上] version adds 「亦」, and the same applies to the following two lines.\n\n*Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jǐngfú* [景福本] lacks the 「而」 character, and the same applies to the next five lines.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本] and *Suì* [遂本] omit the six 「而」 characters; the *Yán Zūn* [严遵] and *Péng* [彭] versions lack 「故」; the *Fù* [傅本] and *Fàn* [范本] versions include 「亦」, and the same applies below.\n\nIt cannot be exploited for gain, nor can it be harmed;\n\n*Bì Qián* [毕沅] notes: *Wáng* [王弼] omits 「亦」, and the same applies below.\n\nAdditionally, 「害」 is written as 「刿」. *Sū Língzhī* [苏灵芝]’s text renders it as 「秽」. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines 「刿」 as *\"sharp injury\"*, but has no 「秽」 character.\n\nIt cannot be esteemed as noble, nor can it be disdained as lowly.\nThus, it is held in highest honor by the world.\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: All versions lack 「亦」, except the *Héshàng* [河上].\n\n*According to my examination*: In the sentence 「而疏」, *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷] includes 「亦」. In the sentences 「而害」 and 「而贱」, *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷] and *Gù Huān* [顾欢] both include 「亦」. The sentence 「不可得而贵」 is omitted in *Zhào* [赵].\n\nAdditionally, the *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] in *Xúnwúguǐ Piān* [徐无鬼篇] states: *\"Thus, the true person has none whom he holds in excessive familiarity, nor has he any whom he avoids with excessive distance, embracing virtue and brilliance, to harmonize with the world—this is called the true person.\"*\n\nThe meaning of the text is the same.\n\n**[Phonology]** In this chapter, Jiang’s rhyme reads: *mén* (門), *fēn* (纷), *chén* (尘) rhyme (文部). *Yáo Wéndiàn* [姚文田] and *Xī Zòng* [奚侗] agree. *Gāo Běn Hàn* [高本汉] treats *duì* (兑), *ruì* (锐), *mén* (门), *fēn* (纷), *chén* (尘), and *guāng* (光), *tóng* (同) as alternating rhymes. *Duì* rhymes with *ruì*, *mén* with *fēn* and *chén*, and *guāng* with *tóng*—this is an example of rhyming across separate lines.\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] stele version contains **68 characters**, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] version **60**, the *Héshàng* [河上] version **69**, the *Wáng* [王] version **66**, and the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions **70**. The *Héshàng* [河上] version is titled *\"Chapter 56 on Mysterious Virtue\"* [玄德第五十六], the *Wáng* [王] version *\"Chapter 56\"* [五十六章], and the *Fàn* [范] version *\"Chapter 56 on the Wise Who Speak Not\"* [知者不言章第五十六].\n\n**Chapter 57: Governing the State with Rectitude**\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The *Yù Zhù* [御注] misinterprets 「以正」 as 「以政」.\n*Wǔ Nèi Yì Xióng* [武内义雄] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] and *Suì* [遂] versions read 「政」.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù Yì* [傅奕], *Xíng Xuàn* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], and the *Wénzǐ Shàng Lǐ Piān* [文子上礼篇] all read 「政」. *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷] reads 「以正之国」, *Gù Huān* [顾欢] reads 「以正理国」, while the *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] and *Wáng Rì* [王弼] versions follow this stele.\n\n*Yǐn Wénzǐ Dàdào Xià* [尹文子大道下] cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] as saying: *\"Governing the state with rectitude, employing the Dao/Way in warfare, and attaining the world through non-action. Rectitude refers to established laws and norms.\"* *Gù Běnchéng* [顾本成] glosses: *\"Rectitude refers to the laws and teachings of the state\"*—this aligns with *Yǐn Wénzǐ* [尹文子], likely reflecting the perspective of the *Námiǎ* [名法] school.\n\n*According to my examination*: 「正」 and 「政」 were interchangeable in ancient usage, but here, paired with 「奇」, it should read 「正」. In **Chapter 45**, *\"Calmness and tranquility are the Dao/Way for the world\"* [清静为天下正], and in this chapter, *\"I love tranquility, and the people naturally align with rectitude\"* [我好静而民自正], both should use the original character.\n\n*Employing the Dao/Way in warfare*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The *Yù Zhù* [御注] mistakenly reads 「以奇」 as 「以其」.\n*Liú Shīpéi* [刘师培] says: Since 「奇」 is paired with 「正」, its meaning aligns with *yé* (邪, \"deviant\"). The *Guānzǐ Báixīn Piān* [管子白心篇] glosses: *\"A deviant person is one whose name and conduct are ruined\"* [奇身名废], and explains: *\"Deviant means unorthodox and not rectified.\"* Thus, 「奇」 means \"not rectified,\" and *employing the Dao/Way in warfare* refers to \"not relying on orthodox military methods.\"\n\n*Attaining the world through non-action.*\n\nHow do I know this to be so?\n*According to this.*\n\n*According to my examination*: *Attaining the world* refers to *winning the hearts of the people*. In **Chapter 48**, it states: *\"What is called attaining the world is to do so through non-action; when there is action, it is insufficient to attain the world.\"* *Xúnzǐ Wángzhì Piān* [荀子王制篇] corroborates this: *\"Chéng Hóu* [成侯] and *Sì Gōng* [嗣公] were rulers who accumulated wealth and calculated numbers, but they did not win the people’s hearts. *Zǐchǎn* [子产] won the people’s hearts, but he did not implement governance.\"* *Yáng Tà* [杨倞] annotates: *\"Unattained means their abilities were insufficient; winning the people’s hearts refers to gaining the people’s loyalty.\"* Thus, observing that action fails to win the people’s hearts confirms that non-action can gain their loyalty and attain the world.\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The phrase *知其然* [知其然], in the *Héshàng* [河上], *Wáng Rì* [王弼], and *Gāo Qì* [高翿] versions, has an additional 「哉」 at the end.\n*Wǔ Nèi Yì Xióng* [武内义雄] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] and *Suì* [遂] versions read 「天下之然」 for 「其然」.\n*Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes: The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Yù Zhù* [御注], and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions all lack the 「哉」 character.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read 「奚」 instead of 「何」, and have an additional 「天下」 after 「知」. The *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], and *Gù Huān* [顾欢] versions agree. *Yán* [严], *Péng* [彭], *Gāo Qì* [高翿], and *Wú Miǎnxué* [吴勉学] versions omit 「以此」. *Yú Yì* [俞樾] notes: The following sentences from *\"Governing the state with rectitude\"* to *\"according to this\"* should belong to the previous chapter. For example, in **Chapter 21**, it states: *\"How do I know the multitude’s nature to be such? According to this.\"* In **Chapter 54**, it states: *\"How do I know the world’s nature to be such? According to this.\"* Both use 「以此」 as the concluding phrase for the chapter. The subsequent passage *\"The world abounds with taboos, yet the people grow ever poorer\"* should be treated as a separate chapter, but it is mistakenly combined here.\n\n*The world abounds with taboos, yet the people grow ever poorer;*\n*The more the people possess useful tools, the more the state becomes corrupt.*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: All versions read 「民」 instead of 「人」.\n*Wú Yún* [吴云] states: The *Fù* [傅] version reads 「夫天下多忌讳」, but other versions lack the 「夫」 character.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Péng* [彭], *Fàn* [范], and *Gāo* [高] versions follow the *Fù* [傅] version, including 「夫」. 「弥」 is written as 「○」 in the *Fù* [傅] version. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines 「○」 as *\"long duration\"* [久长也], from *cháng* (长), with the phonetic *ěr* (尔); modern usage renders it as 「弥」. The *Xiǎo Ěryǎ* [小尔雅] glosses: *\"弥 means prolonged.\"* Additionally, the *Yílì Shìguān Lǐ* [仪礼士冠礼] states: *\"Threefold reverence is added to the crown\"* [三加弥尊], with the note: *\"Like ‘benefit’.\"* The *Jìn Yǔ* [晋语] says: *\"The praise grew ever more flourishing\"* [赞言弥兴], and the *Dōngjīng Fù* [东京赋] states: *\"The ages passed, yet its brilliance grew\"* [历世弥光]—both use 「弥」 as a substitute for 「益」.\n\nThe phrase *\"The world abounds with taboos\"* is annotated by *Wáng Rì* [王弼] as: *\"What is feared is ‘忌’, what is concealed is ‘讳’.\"* It means that as taboos and prohibitions multiply in the world, the people become ever poorer.\n\nIn the phrase *\"The more the people possess useful tools\"*, the *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] and *Wáng Rì* [王弼] versions both have an additional 「民」 character at the start, while the *Fù* [傅] version lacks it. This 「民」 character is rendered as 「人」 in the *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], and *Péng* [彭] versions. The *Fàn* [范] version includes an additional 「而」 after 「器」, with *Fàn* [范] noting: *\"The ancient versions had the ‘而’ character.\"*\n\n*The more the people possess clever skills and strange devices, the more corruption arises;*\n*The more the people possess wisdom, the more deviant practices flourish.*\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read 「民」 instead of 「人」, while the *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] and *Wáng Rì* [王弼] versions read 「人」. The *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read *\"The people possess wisdom, and deviant practices flourish\"* [民多知慧而邪事滋起], with *Fàn* [范] noting: *\"Wáng Rì* [王弼] follows the ancient version, with ‘邪’ repeated.\"*\n\n「谦之案」: The *Wáng Bì* [王弼] annotation reads: *\"When the people possess much wisdom, clever deceits arise; when clever deceits arise, deviant practices flourish.\"* This is the *Wáng* [王] version’s original reading of 「邪事」, consistent with the *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Lù Xīshēng* [陆希声] versions.\n\n「伎巧」: The *Sīmǎ* [司马] version renders 「伎」 as 「利」, while the *Yùzhù* [御注], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], and other versions read 「技」.\n\n*Note*: 「邪」 and 「奇」 are interchangeable characters.\n\nIn the *Jiǎzǐ* [贾子] text on Daoist teachings: *\"Square and straight is called ‘正’ (right/orthodox); deviation from this is ‘邪’ (deviant).\"*\nIn the *Lǐjì* [礼记] *Jìyì* [祭义]: *\"Though there are strange and deviant things, they are not addressed\"* [虽有奇邪而不治者], where 「奇邪」 may also be written as 「奇邪」.\nIn the *Zhōulǐ* [周礼] *Bǐzhǎng* [比长]: *\"If there are crimes or strange deviant acts, they are brought to justice\"* [有罪奇邪则相及], with the annotation: *\"This means evil.\"* In the *Gōngzhèng* [宫正] text: *\"With those who are strange and deviant\"* [与其奇邪之民], the annotation states: *\"Strange and deviant, meaning cunning and deceitful.\"* In the *Nèizǎi* [内宰]: *\"Prohibit their strange and deviant acts\"* [禁其奇邪], the annotation explains: *\"Like today’s flatterers.\"* In the *Sījìu* [司救]: *\"Deviant and evil transgressions\"* [邪恶过失], the annotation clarifies: *\"Deviant and evil refers to disrespecting elders, speaking without restraint, though not yet punishable by law.\"*\n\nThis passage thus reads: *\"The more the people possess clever skills, the more deviant practices arise.\"*\n\nIn this chapter, 「伎巧」 is a corruption of 「知巧」. *Wáng* [王]’s annotation lists 「知慧」 and 「巧伪」 together, while *Zhāng Shèng* [章圣]’s *Běncóng* [本成] commentary states: *\"‘知巧’ means cunning intelligence.\"* The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] version also reads 「知巧」, confirming that the original text should be: *\"The people possess much wisdom, and deviant practices flourish\"* [人多知巧，邪事滋起]. Ancient texts referred to deviant acts as 「奇物」, so 「奇物」 elucidates the meaning of 「邪事」.\n\nHowever, the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions, though following ancient usage, are more logically sound, and thus should be preferred.\n\n*\"When lawful things flourish, thieves and robbers abound.\"*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The *Yùzhù* [御注], *Wáng Bì* [王弼], and *Gāo Yè* [高翿] versions read 「法令」 (laws and commands), while the *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] version reads 「法物」 (lawful things). *Héshàng* [河上] states: *\"‘法物’ means desirable things.\"* *Qiánzhī* [谦之] notes: The *Jǐngfú* [景福], *Nǎijuàn* [柰卷], and *Héshàng* [河上] versions all read 「法物」, while the *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Wáng Xǐzhī* [王羲之] versions read 「法令」. The reading 「法令」 is correct; 「法物」 lacks meaning. *Zhāng Shèng* [章圣]’s *Běncóng* [本成] commentary states: *\"‘法物’ is the same as ‘法令’\"*, confirming that 「法令」 is the superior reading. The *Huánnán* [淮南] *Dàoyìng* [道应训], *Wénzǐ* [文子] *Dàoyuán* [道原篇], *Shǐjì* [史记] *Cūlì Lièchuán* [酷吏列传], and *Hànshū* [后汉书] *Dōngyí Chuán* [东夷传] all quote 「法令」. The character 「物」 likely resulted from confusion with the preceding 「奇物」.\n\n*\"When lawful commands flourish\"* [法令滋彰] aligns with *\"the heavy taxes on the people\"* [上食税之多] and *\"‘佳兵者不祥之器’ (Fine weapons are ominous tools)\"* [夫佳兵者不祥之器], all of which represent *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s political philosophy—not merely opposition to luxurious objects.\n\nThe *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read 「章」 instead of 「彰」, and the *Fàn* [范] version includes an unnecessary 「而」 after 「章」, which should be omitted.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people become upright;\nI take no action, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: In most versions, 「人」 is written as 「而民」 in *\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves\"* [我无为，而民自化], and similarly in the following three sentences. The *Yùzhù* [御注] places *\"I take no action, yet the people grow wealthy\"* [我无事，人自富] above *\"I love tranquility\"* [我好静]. *Bì Qián* [毕沅] states: The *Míngdào Cáng* [明道藏] *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] version includes an additional sentence: *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清], but this is not found in other versions. *Jì Yùn* [纪昀] notes: One version does include this sentence. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions all read 「朴」 (simple/uncorrupted), while the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] version also includes the sentence *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清].\n\n*Qiánzhī* [谦之] notes: *Yán Zūn* [严遵], *Xíng Xuàn* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Wénzǐ* [文子] *Dàoyuán* [道原篇], *Yùlǎn* [御览] 76, and *Wénxuǎn* [文选] *Dōngjīng Fù* [东京赋注] all place *\"I take no action\"* [我无事] above *\"I love tranquility\"* [我好静], matching the *Yùzhù* [御注]. The *Yàn Tiě Lùn* [盐铁论] *Dàoxīn* [道秦] section quotes *\"I have no desires\"* [我无欲] above *\"I take no action\"* [我无事]. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] version reads 「政」 (governance) instead of 「正」 (upright), and includes *\"the whole world\"* [天下] before 「自正」. *Bì Qián* [毕沅] states: 「靖」 (tranquil) is read as 「静」 (quiet) in other versions, and *\"the whole world\"* [天下] is also written as *\"the people\"* [民] in other versions. *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] reads: *\"Without action, all things transform themselves; profound stillness, and the people settle\"* [无为而万物化，渊静而百姓定]. *Zhào Mèngfǔ* [赵孟俯]’s version also includes the sentence *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清]. The *Hànshū* [汉书] *Cáo Shēngchuán* [曹参传] *Yán Zhù* [颜注] quotes: *\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves; I love tranquility, yet the people become upright\"* [我无为，民自化；我好静，民自正], matching this stone text except for 「人」 being written as 「民」. This version reads 「民」 (people) instead of 「人」 (person), as the inscriptions all avoid the Tang dynasty taboo on 「人」.\n\n**[Phonology]** *Jiāng* [江]’s rhyme scheme reads: *贫* [贫], *昏* [昏] (File department); *起* [起], *有* [有] (Zhi department); *为* [为], *化* [化] (Ge department); *静* [静], *正* [正] (Geng department); *事* [事], *富* [富] (Zhi department); *欲* [欲], *朴* [朴] (Hou department). *Yáo Wéntián* [姚文田], *Dèng Tíngzhēn* [邓廷桢], and *Xí Dòng* [奚侗] agree. *Xí* [奚] states: *\"‘无为’ (I take no action), ‘好静’ (I love tranquility), ‘无事’ (I take no action), and ‘无欲’ (I have no desires) differ in wording but share meaning, merely varied for rhyme.\"*\n\n*Gāo Běnhàn* [高本汉], due to the Tang dynasty taboo, reads *器* [器] for *贫* [贫], and *为* [为] for *化* [化], with *贫* [贫] and *昏* [昏] rhyming in alternating lines, while the rest follow the same scheme.\n\n*Yáo Nài* [姚鼐] states: Pure tranquility is the right path for the world, so governance is achieved through uprightness, with no other method. *奇* [奇] means surplus; the Dao of zeroing the surplus is complete yet not applied, and thus can also be used in warfare. The common interpretation of this as cunning and deceitful is greatly mistaken. *正* [正] and *兵* [兵] share the same rhyme.\n\n*Gù Yánwǔ* [顾炎武]’s *Tángyùn* [唐韵] *Zhèng wǔ zhī* [正五支] states: *\"‘为’ [为], ancient pronunciation corrupted.\"*\n\nThe *Laozi* states:\n\n*\"The Dao ever acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings can preserve it,\nAll things will transform spontaneously.\n\nI act without doing, yet the people transform spontaneously.\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain treasures;\nTeaches without teaching,\nReturns to the errors of the common folk;\nSupports the spontaneous nature of all things, yet does not dare act.\"*\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* stele version contains **83 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* version, **85**; the *Héshàng* and *Wáng* versions, **88**; the *Fù* version, **92**; and the *Fàn* version, **94**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* version is titled *\"Chapter Fifty-Seven of Pure Wind\"* (淳风第五十七), the *Wáng* version *\"Chapter Fifty-Seven\"* (五十七章), and the *Fàn* version *\"Chapter Fifty-Seven: The Chapter on Governing with Rectitude\"* (以正治国章第五十七).\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight:**\n*\"Its governance is tranquil and unhurried; its people are pure and refined.\"*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* notes: The phrase *\"its people are pure and refined\"* (其人醇醇) is rendered as *\"its people\"* (其民) in most versions, while the *Yùzhù*, *Wáng Bì*, and *Gāo Yì* versions read *\"pure and refined\"* (淳淳).\n\n*Luó Zhènyù* states: The *Jǐnglóng*, *Dūnhuáng*, and *Jǐngfú* versions all read *\"○○\"*.\n\n*Takeuchi Yoshio* observes: The *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions render *\"醇醇\"* as *\"蠢蠢\"*.\n\n*Qián Zhī* notes: The *Héshànggōng* version reads *\"醇醇\"*, while the *Yìlín* citation reads *\"____\"*. The *Nàijuàn* and *Gù Huān* versions align with *Héshàng*; the *Lóuzhèng*, *Péng*, and *Zhào* versions follow *Wáng Bì*; and *Wáng Xīzhī*’s version matches the stone text.\n\n*\"醇\"* and *\"淳\"* were interchangeable in ancient usage.\n*Mǎ Xùlún* cites: In the *Zhuāngzi*’s *\"Xiéshìng\"* (缮性), the *Shìwén* glosses *\"浇淳散朴\"* as *\"淳, also written as 醇\"*—this is the evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions read *\"蠢蠢\"*.\n\nThe *Shuōwén* states: *\"Shǔn (蠢), movement.\"* Again, a reduplicated term, forming a character of appearance. In the *Zuǒ Zhāo* (左昭) *Ershí'èr Zhuàn* (廿二传), it reads, *\"Now the royal house is indeed shǔnshǔn (蠢蠢)!\"* The annotation reads: *\"Appearance of disturbance.\"* The *Shuōwén* citation renders it as *\"shǔn (蠢)\"*. Additionally, the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions, as well as the *Yán* (严) version, read *\"chǔnchǔn (偆偆)\"*.\n\nThe *Chūnqiū Fánlù* (春秋繁露) states: *\"Chǔnchǔn (偆偆) is the appearance of joy and delight.\"* The *Shuōwén* states: *\"Chǔn (偆), abundance.\"* Again, the *Háinán Dàoyīng Xuàn* (淮南道应训) cites it as *\"chúnchún (纯纯)\"*—*chúnchún* being the same as *tuàntuàn (焞焞)*, also *dùndùn (钝钝)*, all signifying the appearance of stupidity and ignorance.\n\nAgain, *\"mènmèn (闷闷)\"*—the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions read *\"mǐnmǐn (闵闵)\"*. *Fàn* (范) states: *\"Mǐn (闵) is pronounced as 'mén' (门).\"* It is noted that *\"mǐnmǐn (闵闵)\"* and *\"mènmèn (闷闷)\"* may be used interchangeably, as seen in Chapter Twenty. The *Shuōwén* states: *\"Mèn (闷), vexation.\"* In the *Chǔcí Xīsòng* (楚辞惜诵), it reads, *\"Zhōng mèn mǎo zhī tuántuán (中闷瞀之忳忳)\"*, annotated as *\"troubled.\"* It is suspected that *\"mènmèn (闷闷)\"* originally may have been written as *\"mènmèn (懑懑)\"*. *Xià Jùn* (夏竦) in his *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* (古文四声韵) cites an ancient *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text containing the character *\"mèn (懑)\"*, written as ○.\n\n*Yì Shùndǐng* (易顺鼎) states: According to the *Dàodé Zhǐguī Lùn* (道德指归论), it reads:\n*\"Not giving, not bestowing—mǐnmǐn (闵闵), mànmàn (缦缦);\nThe myriad people yearn to be drawn—mòmò (墨墨), chǔnchǔn (偆偆).\"*\nHere, *\"mǐnmǐn (闵闵)\"* is a variant of *\"mènmèn (闷闷)\"*, and *\"chǔnchǔn (偆偆)\"* is a variant of *\"shǔnshǔn (蠢蠢)\"*. The *Fù Yì* (傅奕) version reads *\"mǐnmǐn (闵闵)\"* and *\"chǔnchǔn (偆偆)\"*, following this tradition.\n\n*\"Its governance is cháchá (察察), its people...\"*\n*Luó Zhènyù* (罗振玉) notes: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version omits the phrase *\"Its governance...\"*.\n\n*Qián Zhī* (谦之) observes: The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions render *\"cháchá (察察)\"* as *\"[illegible] [illegible]\"* (). Again, all versions render *\"rén (人)\"* as *\"mín (民)\"*, except the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) version, which reads *\"rén (人)\"*. The character *\"[illegible]\"* (缺) is rendered as *\"quē (缺)\"* in all versions. The *Shuōwén* states: *\"Quē (缺), a broken vessel.\"* *Zhū Jiùnshēng* (朱骏声) states: *\"It refers to a broken earthenware vessel. Again, the character is also written as ○, mistakenly taken as 『缺』.\"*\n\nMisfortune is the leaning of fortune;\nFortune is the hidden foundation of misfortune.\nWho truly knows their limits?\n\nYán Kějūn notes: The *Yù Zhù* (御注) reads:\n*\"Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans;\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks.\"*\n\nThe *Hé Shàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions both include two *\"xī\"* (兮) but omit the two *\"zhī\"* (之).\n\n*Qián Zhī* (谦之) observes: The *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Péng* (彭), *Fàn* (范), *Gāo* (高), *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之), and *Zhào Mèngfǔ* (赵孟俯) versions all align with *Hé Shàng* and *Wáng Bì*. The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) version omits both *\"xī\"* (兮) characters.\n\nAgain, all versions render *\"shú\"* (熟) as *\"shú\"* (孰).\nThis speaks of how the common people do not know where misfortune and fortune ultimately rest.\n\nThe *Wénzǐ* (文子) in the *\"Wēimíng\"* (微明) chapter states:\n*\"Benefit and harm share the same gate;\nMisfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors.\nOnly the divine and sagely can distinguish them,\nThus it is said:\n'Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans;\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks.\nWho truly knows their limits?'*\n\nThe *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋) in the *\"Zhì Yuè\"* (制乐) chapter states:\n*\"Thus, misfortune is the leaning of fortune,\nAnd fortune is the hidden foundation of misfortune.\nThis is what only the sage perceives;\nHow could the common people know their limits?\"*\n\nThe *Xúnzǐ* (荀子) in the *\"Zhèngmíng\"* (正名) chapter states:\n*\"When authority is unjust, misfortune is entrusted to desire,\nYet people take it as fortune;\nWhen fortune is entrusted to evil,\nYet people take it as misfortune.\nThis is how people are confused about misfortune and fortune.\"*\n\nAgain, in the *\"Dàluè\"* (大略) chapter:\n*\"Celebrations in the hall,\nCondolences at the gates.\nMisfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors,\nNone know their threshold.\"*\n\nThis aligns with *Jiǎ Yì* (贾谊) in the *\"Fú Fú\"* (鵩赋):\n*\"What difference is there between misfortune and fortune?\nThey are intertwined like knots;\nFate is unfathomable—\nWho truly knows their limits?\"*\n\nAll these passages derive from *Lǎozǐ* (老子).\n\nAgain, *Hán Fēi* (韩非) in the *\"Jiě Lǎo\"* (解老) chapter states:\n*\"Thus it is said, 'Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans'—\nTo complete its purpose.\n...\nThus it is said, 'Fortune, oh, where misfortune lurks'...\nThus he instructs people: 'Who truly knows their limits?'*\n\n*Liú Shīpéi* (刘师培) suspects that the passage after *\"Confusion, oh, where fortune leans\"* includes lost text due to the five characters *\"to complete its purpose\"* (以成其功也).\n\nAgain, the *Yù Lǎn* (御览) in Volume 459, quoting from *Shuōyuàn* (说苑), attributes to *Lǎozǐ*:\n*\"When one gains what benefits, one must consider what harms;\nWhen one rejoices in what brings joy, one must foresee its ruin.\nWhen people do good, Heaven rewards them with fortune;\nWhen people do evil, Heaven punishes them with misfortune.\nThus it is said:\n'Misfortune, oh, where fortune leans;\nFortune, oh, where misfortune lurks.'\"*\n\n*Yì Shùndǐng* (易顺鼎) suspects this may be the lost text from this passage.\n\nIn truth, *Lǎozǐ*'s original words consist only of these three sentences. *Hán Fēi*'s *\"to complete its purpose\"* and the *Shuōyuàn*'s *\"Thus it is said\"* and the preceding lines are all later elaborations on *Lǎozǐ*'s intent, not his original text.

The character *\"ruò\"* [若] is rendered as *\"rú\"* [如] by Yán, Gù, Péng, and Zhào, with the *Shìwén* [释文] also listing *\"rú\"* [如]. *\"Jǐn\"* [啬] appears as *\"shì\"* [式] in the *Dūnhuáng*, *Suì* versions, and the *Zhàozhìběn* [赵志坚本], which is correct.\n\nGù’s annotated version states: *\"Heaven\"* [天] refers to the natural order. *\"Shì\"* [式] means *dharma/law*. *\"Mòruò\"* [莫若] is akin to *\"wúguò\"* [无过], meaning \"nothing surpasses.\" It states that to harmonize with the Heavenly Dao/Way above and transform the people below, nothing surpasses applying the *dharma/law* of non-action.\n\nThis is what Gù saw in his version as *\"shì\"* [式].\n\nHonor’s annotation further says: *\"Nothing surpasses using the Dao/Way as the standard dharma/law.\"* Thus, even Li Róng’s version he saw had *\"shì\"* [式]. *\"Shì\"* [式] is the standard dharma/law, akin to today’s term *guīlǜ* [规律].\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] states: *\"Shì\"* [式], *dharma/law*.\n\nThe *Zhōushū Xìfǎ* [周书谥法] states: *\"Shì\"* [式], *dharma/law*.\n\nThe *Guǎngyǎ Shìgǔ* [广雅释诂] states: *\"Shì\"* [式], *○* [也] (i.e., \"so\").\n\nThe *Shīxià Wǔ* [诗下武] annotation on *\"xiàshì zhīshì\"* [下士之式] says: *\"Dharma/law.\"*\n\nIn the *Yìjīng* [易经], Chapter Twenty-Two: *\"The sage holds unity as the standard dharma/law for all under Heaven,\"* Yì Shùndīng remarks: *\"Shì\"* [式] is the same as *\"zhuó\"* [栻]. The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅] states: *\"Zhuó\"* [栻], *fú* [梮] (a wooden divination device). This *fú* [梮] embodies Heaven and Earth, used to observe yin and yang, and divine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, made from *fēngzǐ* [枫子] and *zǎoxīn* [枣心] wood. The *Hànshū Wángmào* [汉书王莽传] states: *\"The Heavenly Astronomy Officer examines the *fú* [栻] before him,\"* which is the same, though the character is also written as *\"shì\"* [式]. The *Zhōulǐ* [周礼] states: *\"The Grand Historian holds the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times, riding with the Grand Musician,\"* and Zhèng Sīnóng [郑司农] explains: *\"When the Grand Historian goes out, he holds the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times and divines auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.\"* Thus, *\"shì\"* [式] holds this meaning.\n\nQiánzhī notes: The *Yì* [易] explanation is quite distinct. Since Lǎozǐ was the Grand Historian beneath the *Zhōu* [周] pillar, Zēngzǐ’s question, as cited by Zhèng Xuán, states: *\"Lǎodān\"* [老聃], the Grand Historian of *Zhōu* [周]. Thus, it is likely that he once held the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times, which may also have been part of his duties.\n\nHere, it states: *\"To govern people and serve the Dao/Way of Heaven, nothing surpasses the standard dharma/law.\"* In Chapter Twenty-Eight: *\"To be the standard dharma/law for all under Heaven,\"* and Chapter Sixty-Five: *\"These two are also the standard dharma/law; always know the standard dharma/law,\"* the term *\"shì\"* [式] is consistently interpreted as the standard dharma/law, and this concept originates from observing celestial phenomena.\n\nOnly through *jǐn* [啬] is it called *zǎo fú* [早服].\nQiánzhī notes: The *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions render *\"jǐn\"* [啬] as *\"shì\"* [式]. *\"Wèi\"* [谓] is written as *\"wéi\"* [惟] in the *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions, as well as in Yán, Péng, Gù, Fù, and Fàn versions. *\"Zǎo\"* [早] is rendered as *\"zǎo\"* [蚤] in Yán’s version. Both *\"wéi\"* [谓] and *\"zǎo\"* [蚤] align with Hàn Fēi’s interpretation of Lǎozǐ.\n\n*\"Zǎo fú\"* [早服] is written as *\"zǎo fú\"* [早伏] in the *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions, *\"zǎo fù\"* [早复] in Péng and Zhào’s versions, and matches this stone version in Fù and Fàn’s versions.\n\nFàn states: *\"Wáng Bì\"* [王弼], *\"Sūn Dēng\"* [孙登], and the world’s versions all read *\"zǎo fú\"* [早服].\n\nYú Yì states: According to *Kùn Xué Jìwén* [困学纪闻], Volume Ten, the two *\"fú\"* [服] characters are rendered as *\"fù\"* [复], and he also cites *Sīmǎ Gōng* [司马公] and *Zhū Wén Gōng* [朱文公]’s interpretations, stating *\"bùyuǎn ér fù\"* [不远而复].\n\nHe further states: *\"Wáng Bì’s version is ‘zǎo fú’ [早服], but his annotation reads ‘early fú [服] is constant,’ which should also be ‘fù’ [复].\"*\n\nNow, according to Hàn Fēi’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老] essay, it states: *\"He who is able to practice *jǐn* [啬] is one who follows the Dao/Way and submits to *lǐ* [理]. The common people are distant from calamity and immersed in misfortune, yet they still do not know to retreat and submit to the Dao/Way and principles. The sage, though he has not yet seen the form of calamity and misfortune, emptily submits to the Dao/Way and principles, thus calling it *zǎo fú* [早服].\"*\n\nHence, the ancient versions were indeed *\"fú\"* [服]. Wáng’s annotation is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, according to Hàn Fēi’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老], *\"Only through *jǐn* [啬] is it called *zǎo fú* [早服],\"* Lú Wénpián states: *\"Zhāng’s version renders ‘wèi’ [谓] as ‘wéi’* [惟], and ‘yǐ’* [以] as ‘wèi’* [谓]. Líng’s version renders ‘fú’* [服] as ‘fù’* [复], with both characters identical in the upper and lower sentences. Wáng Bì’s version reads ‘fù’* [复], and the *Shìwén* [释文] states: ‘*fù* [复] pronounced as *fú* [服].’\"*\n\nGù Guǎngchì states: *\"Fù’s version and the current *Déjīng* [德经] render ‘wèi’* [谓] as ‘wéi’* [惟]. The current *Déjīng* [德经] renders ‘yǐ’* [以] as ‘wèi’* [谓], aligning with Fù’s version.\"*\n\nWáng Xiānshèn states: *\"Líng’s version renders it as ‘fù’* [复], likely due to a miscorrection of the ancient Lǎozǐ text.\"*\n\nThe passage above states: *\"From the Way and in accordance with Principle\"* [従于道而服于理], yet it also says *\"not to serve the Way and Principle\"*, and further declares *\"the empty and void serve the Way and Principle\"*—thus elucidating the meaning of Laozi’s *\"early service\"* [蚤服]. The *\"service\"* [服] in *\"service to\"* [服从] should indeed be *\"service\"* [服], leaving no room for doubt. Thus, it is clear that the *Déjīng* [德经] cited by Hàn Fēi reads *\"service\"* [服], not *\"repeat\"* [复].\n\nThe *Kùnxué Jìwén* [困学纪闻] cites Laozi with *\"service\"* [服] as *\"repeat\"* [复], also quoting Sīmǎ Guāng and Zhú Wén Gōng as saying: *\"Not distant and yet returning\"* [不远而复], claiming *\"Wáng Bì’s text reads ‘early service’ [早服], but his annotation states ‘early service is the constant’ [早服常也], which should also be ‘returning’ [复].\"* By this account, Wáng Bì’s text still reads *\"service\"* [服], aligning with this book. The Sòng scholars, relying on the *Shìwén* [释文] for interpretation, failed to verify Hàn Fēi’s text. Líng Shì [凌氏] altered the text based on a corrupted Laozi manuscript, which is incorrect.\n\n**My examination:** *\"Early service\"* [蚤服] is correct. Fàn Běn [范本] cites Wáng’s text as *\"early returning\"* [早复], and the *Dàozàng* [道藏] Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu’s [张太守] compilation of the Four Commentaries quotes Wáng’s annotation: *\"Early returning is the constant\"* [早复常也], *\"Early returning is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\"* [早复谓之重积德者也]. Thus, both Fàn [范] and Zhāng [张] saw that Wáng’s text also had instances of *\"returning\"* [复]. Sīmǎ Guāng said: *\"Not distant and yet returning, not departing from virtue—this can be used to cultivate oneself.\"* Zhú Xī said: *\"If one practices *jǐn* [啬], then one is not distant and yet returns, repeatedly accumulating virtue—first, one has already accumulated [virtue], and later, one nurtures it through *jǐn* [啬], which is yet another layer of accumulation.\"* All of these interpretations apply Confucian reasoning to Laozi, arbitrarily changing *\"early service\"* [早服] to *\"early returning\"* [早复]. The *\"corrupted manuscript\"* [误本] that Wáng Xiānshèn refers to is likely this very alteration.\n\nGāo Hēng conjectures: *\"Perhaps there should be a ‘Way’ [道] after ‘service’ [服], making ‘early service to the Way’ [早服道], which parallels the structure of ‘repeatedly accumulating virtue’ [重积德]. The phrase ‘service to the Way’ [服道] aligns with Chapter 23’s ‘engaging in the Way’ [从事于道].\"* The Hàn Fēi’s citation lacks the ‘Way’ [道], indicating that the omission occurred long ago. This chapter’s rhyme scheme follows: *jǐn* [啬], *dào* [道], *dé* [德], *kè* [克], *jí* [极], *mǔ* [母], *jiǔ* [久], *dào* [道]. The ‘Way’ [道] is also omitted after *\"early service\"* [早服] in the following sentence.\n\n**My examination:** Gāo’s conjecture is correct. Héshàng Gōng’s [河上公] annotation on *\"early service\"* [早服] states: *\"Early means ‘prior’; service means ‘obtaining.’ He who loves the people’s wealth and cherishes *qì* [精气] can first obtain the Way of Heaven.\"* His annotation on *\"repeatedly accumulating virtue\"* [重积德] reads: *\"To first obtain the Way of Heaven is called repeatedly accumulating virtue in oneself.\"* Thus, both of Héshàng Gōng’s sentences originally included ‘Way’ [道], now omitted.\n\n*\"Early service\"* is called *\"repeatedly accumulating virtue.\"* Wáng Xiānshèn notes: *\"Héshàng Gōng’s ‘is called’ [谓之] is written as ‘this is called’ [是谓], matching the text in Hàn Fēi’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老].\"* **My examination:** Yán Zhēn’s [严遵] text lacks this sentence. The characters *\"early service\"* [蚤服] can be verified through Hàn Fēi’s annotation, where *\"service\"* [服] is interpreted as *\"serving the Way and Principle\"* [服从道理].\n\nThe *Yú Shū* [虞书] states: *\"The Five Punishments have their service\"* [五刑有服], with the transmission explaining: *\"Follow\"* [从也]. The *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines *\"service\"* [服] as *\"to attend to\"* [事也]. The *Lǐjì* [礼记] *Kǒngzǐ Xiánjū* [孔子闲居] states: *\"The gentleman’s service to it\"* [君子之服之也], with the annotation: *\"Like habituation\"* [犹习也]. *\"Service\"* [服] carries the meaning of *\"following and habituating\"* [从习], meaning *\"following the Way and habituating to Principle\"* [从于道而习于理].\n\nAdditionally, *\"virtue\"* [德] is borrowed for *\"obtain\"* [得]. The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] states: *\"Virtue, to obtain\"* [德，得也]. The *Zuǒzhuàn* [左传] (24th year of Duke Xiāng) says: *\"Virtue is the foundation of the state\"* [德，国家之基也]. The *Jiālǐng* [家语] *Rùguān* [入官] states: *\"Virtue is the beginning of governance\"* [德，政之始也]. The *Lǚshì* [吕览] *Jīngtōng* [精通] declares: *\"Virtue is the sovereign of the people\"* [德也者，万民之宰也]. All these instances borrow *\"virtue\"* [德] for *\"obtain\"* [得].\n\nIt states: *\"Early service to the Way and Principle\"* [早服从道理] *\"accumulates deep and profound virtue\"* [则积得深厚也]. Repeatedly accumulating virtue means nothing is unconquered; nothing unconquered means its limits are unknown. Yán Kějūn [严可均] notes: *\"Then nothing is unconquered\"* [则无不克], with the Imperial annotation and Wáng Bì reading *\"unconquered\"* [不克], as in the following sentence.\n\n**My examination:** The *Jǐngfú* [景福], Yán Zhēn [严遵], Héshàng Gōng [河上公], Shìmáng [室町], and Nǎijuǎn [柰卷] texts all read *\"conquer\"* [克], while the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], Fù [傅], and Fàn [范] texts also read *\"conquer\"* [克], whereas the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] text mistakenly reads *\"fill\"* [充]. Yán Zhēn’s text lacks the following *\"nothing is unconquered, its limits are unknown\"* [无不克则莫知其极] sentences.\n\n**Examination:** *\"Conquer\"* [克] and *\"able\"* [能] can be used interchangeably. Both the *Zìlín* [字林] and *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìyán* [释言] define *\"conquer\"* [克] as *\"able\"* [能]. Héshàng Gōng’s annotation states: *\"Conquer, to overcome\"* [克，胜也]. The *Zìlín* [字林] defines *\"conquer\"* [克] as *\"able\"* [能], indicating that the sound and meaning are identical.\n\nThe *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines *\"extreme\"* [极] as *\"to reach\"* [至也]. The *Lǚshì* [吕览] *Zhìyuè* [制乐] states: *\"How can the musician know its extreme?\"* [乐人焉知其极], with the annotation: *\"Like ‘end’* [犹终也]. The *Lǐjì* [礼记] *Dàxué* [大学] says: *\"The gentleman exhausts all things\"* [君子无所不用其极], with the annotation: *\"Exhaust\"* [尽也]. The *Lí Sāo* [离骚] states: *\"Observing the people’s calculations reach their extreme\"* [观民之计极], with the annotation: *\"Exhaustion\"* [穷也]. Here, *\"its limits are unknown\"* [莫知其极] means *\"its exhaustion is unknown\"* [莫知其所穷尽之义].\n\nIf its limits are unknown, one can establish a state. The foundation of establishing a state can endure long. **My examination:** The *Dūn* [敦] and *Suì* [遂] texts read *\"able\"* [能] instead of *\"unknown\"* [莫], Yán’s [严] text reads *\"can be\"* [为] instead of *\"establish\"* [有], and the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] text reads *\"long enduring\"* [久长] instead of *\"long\"* [长久]. Fàn’s [范] text includes *\"then\"* [则] after *\"extreme\"* [极]. Fàn states: *\"The ‘then’ [则] character appears in Héshàng Gōng’s and Hàn Fēi’s ancient texts.\"*\n\nThis is called the *Dao* of deep roots, firm foundations, longevity, and enduring vision. Yán Kějūn [严可均] notes: *\"Firm foundations\"* [固蒂] is annotated in the Imperial text as *\"old foundations\"* [故蒂] and by Wáng Bì as *\"firm roots\"* [固柢]. Bì Yàn [毕沅] states: *\"Roots\"* [柢], Héshàng Gōng reads as *\"foundations\"* [蒂], and Hàn Fēi reads: *\"Deepen its roots, firm its foundations\"* [深其根，固其柢], without the *\"this is called\"* [是谓] characters.\n\n「The *Su Lingshi* [蘇靈芝] text also uses *\"foundation\"* [蒂]. Lǚ Zhèn’yù [羅振玉] notes: *\"Roots\"* [柢], the *Shìwén* [釋文] states: *\"Also written as ‘foundation’\"* [亦作「蒂」]. The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], Imperial, and *Jǐngfú* [景福] texts all read *\"foundation\"* [蒂].\n\nQiánzhī [謙之] notes: The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], Xíng Xuán [邢玄], Pánxī [磻溪], Lóuzhèng [樓正], Shìmǎtíng [室町], Nǎijuǎn [柰卷], Yán [嚴], Gù [顧], Zhào [趙], and Gāo [高] texts all read *\"foundation\"* [蒂], matching the *Yìlín* [意林] and *Yùlǎn* [御覽] citations (vol. 659). The Fèi [傅] and Fàn [范] texts read *\"roots\"* [柢]. Fàn states: *\"The ‘roots’* [柢] *character*—Fèi Yì [傅奕] cites the ancient text: ‘Roots are the base of trees’* [柢，木根也]。 He further cites Guō Pú [郭璞]: ‘Roots refer to the foundation of roots’* [柢謂根柢也]。 Héshàng Gōng [河上公] uses ‘foundation’ [蒂], which is not the true meaning of the *Classic*. For ‘roots’ [柢] is also the root.\"* Qiánzhī notes: The *Zìlín* [字林] states: *\"‘Foundation’ [蒂] and ‘roots’ [柢] share the same pronunciation.\"* Xià Jùn’s [夏竦] *Gǔwén Sìshēngyùn* [古文四声韵] (vol. 4) cites an ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text also reading *\"foundation\"* [蒂], but Fàn disagrees.\n\nFurthermore, *\"long life, enduring vision\"* [長生久視] was a common phrase of the time. In the *Róngrù Piān* [荣辱篇] of *Xúnzǐ* [荀子], it states: *\"This is how the common people secure warm clothing, full stomachs, long life, and enduring vision to avoid punishment.\"* In the *Chóngjǐ Piān* [重己篇] of *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* [吕氏春秋], it states: *\"The rulers and nobles of the world, whether virtuous or otherwise, all desire long life and enduring vision.\"* Gāo Yù [高诱] annotates: *\"Vision\"* [視] *\"means ‘to live’* [活也].\"* The meaning here aligns with *Lǎozǐ*.\n\n---\n**Phonology:**\nJiāng Shì’s [江氏] rhyme reading for this chapter:\n*\"Shè, shè, fù, dé, dé, kè, kè, jí, guó, mǔ, jiǔ, dào\"* [啬、啬、复、德、德、克、克、极、国、母、久、道] (with *zhī* [之] and *yōu* [幽] in the same rhyme group, *shè* [啬] as *shǐ* [史] in the entering tone, *fù* [复] rhyming with *fángbī* [房逼], *kè* [克] as *kūlì* [枯力], *guó* [国] as *gǔbī* [古逼], *dào* [道] rhyming with *túyǐ* [徒以]).\n\nQiánzhī notes: *\"Shè, fù, dé, kè, jí, guó, mǔ\"* [啬、复、德、克、极、国、母] belong to the *zhī* [之] rhyme, while *jiǔ* [久] and *dào* [道] share the *zhī/yōu* [之、幽] final.\n\nYáo Wéntián [姚文田] groups *\"shè, shè, fù, dé, kè, jí, jí, guó\"* [啬、啬、服、德、克、极、极、国] as one rhyme (first *yàn* [戠] entering tone), and *\"mǔ, jiǔ\"* [母、久] as another (fourth *zhī* [之] rising tone). Dèng Tíngzhēn [邓廷桢] agrees. Dèng states: *\"The character ‘jiǔ’* [久] *rhymes with ‘mǔ’* [母] *above, matching the *Shī* [诗] rhyme, and with ‘dào’* [道] *below, matching the *Yì Xiàngzhuàn* [易象传] rhyme.\"*\n\nXí Dòng [奚侗] groups *\"shè, shè, fù, fù, dé, dé, kè, kè, jí, jí, guó\"* [啬、啬、复、复、德、德、克、克、极、极、国] as one rhyme, with *fù* [复] pronounced as *fú* [服]. *\"Mǔ, jiǔ, dào\"* [母、久、道] form another. All failed to recognize that *\"zhī\"* [之] *and \"yōu\"* [幽] *originally fully rhymed.*\n\nAdditionally, *\"shè\"* [啬] is read as *\"shì\"* [式] in the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] and *Suìzhōu* [遂州] texts, with *\"shì\"* [式] also belonging to the *zhī* [之] entering tone. Chén Dì’s [陈第] *Qū Sòng Gǔyīnyì* [屈宋古音义] states: *\"‘Fú’* [服] *is pronounced ‘bī’* [逼]; in *Shī* [诗], *Yì* [易], and ancient Qin-Han texts, there is none that does not read it as ‘bī’* [逼].\"* Gù Yánwù’s [顾炎武] *Tángyùn Zhèng* [唐韵正] (under *Yīwū* [一屋] entering tone) cites *\"fú\"* [服] with the ancient pronunciation *pǔběifǎn* [蒲北反], referencing this passage of *Lǎozǐ*.\n\n**Collateral Evidence:**\nIn the *Lí Sāo* [离骚] of *Chǔcí* [楚辞]:\n*\"Gazing forward and looking back, observing the people’s schemes to their limits—who among them is not virtuous and worthy of emulation!\"*\nThe *Jìnglóng* [景龙] stele text contains 64 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] text 63, while the Héshàng Gōng [河上公], Wáng [王], Fèi [傅], and Fàn [范] texts contain 64. The Fàn [范] text alone has 65.\n\nThe **Heshang Gong** [河上] text titles this as *\"Shǒudào Dì Wǔshíjiǔ\"* [守道第五十九], the **Wang** [王] text as *\"Wǔshíjiǔpiān\"* [五十九章], and the **Fan** [范] text as *\"Zhìrén Shìtiān Zhāng Dì Wǔshíjiǔ\"* [治人事天章第五十九].\n\n**Chapter Sixty:**\n*\"Zhì dàguó ruò hēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国若亨小鲜].\n\nLuo Zhènyù [罗振玉] notes: *\"Hēng\"* [亨], the **Wang** [王] text reads *\"pēng\"* [烹], matching the **Jǐngfú** [景福] text. The *Shìwén* [释文] cites *\"pēng\"* [烹], with the annotation: *\"Should not add ‘fire’.\"* Thus, the **Wang** [王] text originally read *\"hēng\"* [亨], now corrected. The **Jǐnglóng** [景龙] and **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌] texts both read *\"hēng\"* [亨], while the **Yùzhù** [御注] and **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌] **Gǔběn** [古本] read *\"xiǎng\"* [享].\n\nAgain, *\"xiān\"* [鲜], the **Dūnhuáng** [敦煌] **Xīn** [辛] text reads *\"xīng\"* [腥], annotated: *\"Heshang Gong* [河上] *reads ‘xiān’* [鲜].\"*\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes: The **Suìzhōu** [遂州] text reads *\"hòu xiǎoxīng\"* [厚小腥], with *\"hòu\"* [厚] being erroneous. The **Fan** [范] text reads *\"hēng xiǎolín\"* [亨小鳞], annotated: *\"Xiǎolín* [小鳞] *refers to small fish. To govern a great state is like cooking small fish. He who cooks small fish must not disturb it, for disturbance causes the fish to spoil. Thus, governing a great state requires non-action; action harms the people. For the Dao/Way is the sacred instrument of Heaven, and cannot be manipulated.\"*\n\n*\"Lín\"* [鳞] and *\"shén\"* [神] rhyme, and the meaning aligns.\n\nFurther, the character *\"xīng\"* [腥]: Chéng Xuányīng’s [成玄英] *cóng* [疏] states: *\"Xīng* [腥] *refers to fish; Heshang Gong* [河上] *wrote ‘xiān’* [鲜], also meaning fish.\"* Only *\"xīng\"* [腥] carries the connotation of stench. In the *Chǔcí* [楚辞] *Shèjiāng* [涉江], it reads: *\"Xīngchòu bìng yù\"* [腥臊并御], annotated: *\"Stench.\"* Additionally, *\"ròu zé míxīng\"* [肉则麋腥], with the *cóng* [疏] explaining: *\"Raw meat; also written as* [○].\" *Tōngsúwén* [通俗文] states: *\"The stench of fish is called* xīng*.\"* Though *\"xīng\"* [腥] is more concise in meaning, the **Jǐnglóng** [景龙] stele’s reading of *\"hēng xiǎoxiān\"* [亨小鲜] is preferred.\n\nKǒng Guāngsēn’s [孔广森] *Shīshēng Lèi* [诗声类] under *\"hēng\"* [亨] states: *\"‘Hēng’* [亨], *‘pēng’* [烹], and *‘xiǎng’* [享] are later distinctions; in antiquity, only *‘hēng’* [亨] was used, with its pronunciation likely only as *hēng*.\"*\n\nHeshang Gong’s [河上] annotation reads: *\"Cooking small fish without removing its entrails, scales, or stirring it—lest it spoil.\"*\n\nThe *Huáinán Qísú Xuǎn* [淮南齐俗训] cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] as saying: *\"To govern a great state is like cooking small fish: the lenient approach avoids frequent disturbance; the harsh approach seeks only to season it properly.\"* Both align with the ancient meaning of *Lǎozǐ* [老子].\n\nHóng Yíxiǎn [洪颐烜] states: Referencing *Hánfēizǐ* [韩非子]’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老], *\"Disturbing the masses frequently yields little success; storing precious instruments while moving them often leads to ruin; stirring small fish excessively ruins their flavor; frequently altering laws in a great state brings suffering to the people. Thus, the enlightened ruler values stillness and avoids frequent legal changes. Hence it is said: ‘To govern a great state is like cooking small fish.’\"* The character *\"ruò\"* [若] is likely a corruption of *\"kǔ\"* [苦].\n\nYì Shùndìng [易顺鼎] notes: Previous annotations interpret *\"pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [烹小鲜] as *\"cooking small fish,\"* yet the meaning remains obscure. The *Dàodé Zhǐguī Lùn* [道德指归论] on *\"Zhì Dàguó\"* [治大国] states: *\"Thus, the enlightened ruler governs a great state as if draining small streams.\"* *\"Hēng\"* [亨] means *\"to drain\"* or *\"to complete.\"* *\"Xiān\"* [鲜] in *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] is defined as *\"water’s last remnants.\"* *\"Hēng xiǎoxiān\"* [亨小鲜] thus means *\"draining the last of small water,\"* akin to acting without effort. *\"Hēng\"* [亨] is read as written, while later scholars misread it as *\"pēng\"* [烹]; *\"xiān\"* [鲜] and *\"xiān\"* [鲜] (as in *\"shuǐ xiān\"* [水鲜]) were interchangeable in antiquity. In the *Shī* [诗], *\"Yǒu tù sīshǒu\"* [有兔斯首], the *Jiān* [笺] explains: *\"Sī* [斯] *means ‘white.’\"* Today, *\"sībái\"* [斯白] is written as *\"xiān\"* [鲜], confirming this. *\"Xiǎoxiān\"* [小鲜] is thus *\"xiǎoxiān\"* [小鲜].\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] concludes: Both Hóng [洪] and Yì [易] offer convoluted interpretations, yet it is clear that *\"ruò\"* [若] likely originally read *\"kǔ\"* [苦], and *\"xiān\"* [鲜] may have been *\"xiān\"* [澌] in the strict text.\n\nFurther, *Hánfēizǐ* [韩非子]’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老] includes *\"guó\"* [国] followed by *\"zhě\"* [者], with *Gù Guǎngqì* [顾广圻] noting: *\"The Fèi* [傅] *text and today’s* Dàodéjīng [道德经] *lack the ‘zhě’* [者] *character.\"* Wáng Xiānshèn [王先慎] states: *\"The* Zhìyào [治要] *includes ‘zhě’* [者].\"*\nUpon review, the *Sān Guó Zhì* [三国志] (Vol. 44, Chén Shǔ’s [陈寿] evaluation) reads: *\"Zhì dàguó zhě ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国者若烹小鲜], the *Hòuhànshū* [后汉书] *Xúnlì Zhuan* [循吏传] annotation cites: *\"Lǐ dàguó ruò hēng xiǎoxiān yě\"* [理大国若亨小鲜也], and the *Shǔ Zhì* [蜀志] *Jiāng Wéi Zhuan* [姜维传] evaluation quotes: *\"Zhì dàguó zhě yóu pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国者犹烹小鲜], all including *\"zhě\"* [者]. Conversely, the *Běitáng Shūchuán* [北堂书钞] (Vol. 27) cites *\"Zhì guó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治国若烹小鲜], the *Hòuhànshū* [后汉书] *Yìmín Zhuan* [逸民传] quotes *\"Lǐ dàguó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [理大国若烹小鲜], the *Lèijú* [类聚] (Vol. 52), *Huáinán Qísú Xuǎn* [淮南齐俗训], and *Wénzǐ Dàodé Piān* [文子道德篇] all read *\"Zhì dàguó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国若烹小鲜], lacking *\"zhě\"* [者], matching this stele.\n\nAdditionally, *Mǎ Qíchǎng* [马其昶] notes: *\"The* Máo Zhuan [毛传] *of the* Shī [诗] *states: ‘Stirring fish too much breaks it; governing the people too much scatters them. Knowing how to cook fish is to know how to govern the people.’ This meaning originates from* Lǎozǐ [老子].\"*\n\nWith the Dao governing the realm, its spirits lose their potency.\n\nMetu Guangchi notes: *\"The Fu edition [傅本] has the character ‘者’ [者] after ‘天下’ [天下], differing entirely from other editions.\"*\n\nWang Xianshen remarks: *\"The *Zhìyào* [治要] citation of Lǎozǐ also includes ‘者’ [者], suggesting that the Tang-era Lǎozǐ text seen by scholars originally contained ‘者’ [者].\"*\n\nLuó Zhènyù states: *\"Both the Dunhuang *Zàngběn* [敦煌藏本] and *Jǐngfúběn* [景福本] include ‘者’ [者].\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"The *Nài* [柰] scroll, *Shìtōng* [室町] edition, *Péng* [彭], and *Zhào* [赵] editions also include ‘者’ [者].\"*\n\nAdditionally, the character *yé* [邪] in the Fu edition is written as *lì* [莅].\n\nBì Yàn states: *\"The ancient character for ‘莅’ [莅] was written as ‘○’, also used as a positional marker; the vulgar forms ‘莅’ and ‘邪’ are incorrect.\"*\n\nLù Démíng notes: *\"‘邪’ [邪] was not an ancient character; the *Shuōwén* [说文] renders it as ‘○’.\"*\n\nYì Shùndǐng argues: *\"According to the *Huáinán Túzhēn Xuǎn Zhù* [淮南俶真训注], it reads: ‘With the Dao governing [○] the realm, its spirits lose their potency.’ The ‘○’ is the correct character for ‘莅’ [莅], proving that Gāo Yòu’s [高诱] seen text of Lǎozǐ originally used ‘○’—the forms ‘莅’ and ‘邪’ are erroneous. This aligns with the *Shuōwén*’s citation of Lǎozǐ’s ‘盅’ [盅] character, both being precious ancient script.\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"‘○’ and ‘莅’ share the same meaning. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] defines ‘邪’ [邪] (with the pronunciation *lìzhì* [力致]) as in the *Shī* [诗]: ‘Fāngshū yé zhǐ’ [方叔邪止], meaning ‘to oversee.’ The ‘○’ [○] is defined as *lìjì* [力季] and *lìzhì* [力至], meaning ‘to oversee’ or ‘to follow.’ Thus, ‘以道○天下’ means ‘to govern the realm with the Dao,’ identical in meaning to ‘邪’ [邪]. The character ‘邪’ appears in the *Shījīng* [诗经], yet is absent from the *Shuōwén*, proving it was not absent in antiquity.\"*\n\nQiánzhī further notes: *\"The *Lùnhéng Zhīshí Piān* [论衡知实篇] states: ‘Thus, the virtuous and sage are titles for moral excellence and ability; *shén* [神] refers to the intangible, elusive essence.’ Here, ‘贤圣’ [virtuous and sage] is contrasted with ‘神’ [spirit], reflecting Lǎozǐ’s intent.\"*\n\nWang Dào elaborates: *\"The *Zhuàn* [传] says: ‘When a state is about to flourish, it listens to the people; when it is about to decline, it listens to the spirits.’ When the sage governs the realm with the Dao, public virtue shines clearly, and the people’s hearts remain pure. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune, are all determined by the people; yet fabrications and malevolent influences find no place. Thus, its spirits lose their potency—not that they are powerless, but that they no longer harm the people.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *\"The *Yùzhù* [御注] reads ‘伤民’ [harm the people]; the same applies to the following two sentences.\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"The *Qìngyáng* [庆阳], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Péng* [彭], *Fàn* [范], and *Gāo* [高] editions all read ‘民’ [people], while the Fu edition reads ‘人’ [person]. The *Hánfēizǐ* [韩非子] citation—‘非其鬼不神，其神不伤人也’ [If its spirits are not potent, their potency does not harm people]—includes the ‘也’ [also] character. Only the *Gāndàoběn* [干道本] omits ‘人’ [person] after ‘伤’ [harm].\"*\n\nGù Guāngchì notes: *\"The Fu edition and the current *Déjīng* [德经] lack both ‘也’ [also] characters above and below. The *Zàngběn* [藏本] includes ‘人’ [person] after ‘伤’ [harm], which is correct; the Fu edition and the current *Déjīng* also include it.\"*\n\nIf the spirits do not harm the people, neither does the sage. When neither harms the other, they coexist in harmony.\n\nYán Kějūn states: *\"The various editions read ‘交归焉’ [coexist harmoniously]. Wèi Jiàosūn [魏稼孙] argues that the *Yùzhù* [御注] reads ‘故德交归焉’ [Thus, virtue harmonizes], and Yán mistakenly omitted ‘德’ [virtue].\"*\n\nLuó Zhènyù notes: *\"The *Jìnglóngběn* [景龙本] and *Dūnhuáng Xīnběn* [敦煌辛本] both read ‘故得交归’ [Thus, they coexist harmoniously].\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"The *Qìngyáng* [庆阳], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Péng* [彭], *Fàn* [范], and *Gāo* [高] editions all read ‘民’ [people]. The *Hánfēizǐ Jiělǎo* [韩非子解老] renders ‘故’ [thus] as ‘则’ [then], matching the *Fànběn* [范本].\"*\n\nRegarding the citation ‘圣人亦不伤民’ [The sage also does not harm the people], Gù Guāngchì notes: *\"The Fu edition and the current *Déjīng* [德经] both render ‘民’ [people] as ‘人’ [person]. However, the *Hánzǐ* [韩子] himself uses ‘民’ [people].\"*\n\nWáng Xiānshèn remarks: *\"The sentence should include ‘非其神不伤’ [If its potency does not harm], but only the *Zhào Mèngfǔběn* [赵孟俯本] lacks it, likely due to an error in the printed text deleting it. The *Héshànggōng* [河上公], *Wángbì* [王弼], and Fu editions all retain it.\"*\n\nRegarding the character ‘亦’ [also], all editions agree, except the *Dūnhuáng Xīnběn* [敦煌辛本], which reads ‘之’ [of]. It notes: *\"All editions read ‘亦’ [also], except the *Zhāng Xìtiān* [张系天] (the *Qiángběn Chéngshū* [强本成疏] renders ‘天’ [heaven] as ‘师’ [master]) and *Lù Xiānshēng* [陆先生], which read ‘之’ [of]. Since ‘之’ and ‘亦’ are visually similar, scribes mistakenly wrote ‘亦’; now, ‘之’ is restored. It means that these spirits do not harm things, but when the people govern the realm with the Dao, they can subdue evil influences (the *Gùběn* [顾本] and *Qiángběn Chéngshū* [强本成疏] render ‘耶’ [interrogative] as ‘邪’ [malevolent]), so the spirits no longer harm the people. The power lies in sage governance (the *Gùběn Chéngshū* [顾本成疏] renders ‘治’ [govern] as ‘理’ [principle]), hence ‘the sage does not harm people.’\"*\n\nTáo Hóngqìng argues: *\"The characters ‘非其’ [If its] are likely a textual error, mistakenly inserted from the preceding ‘非其鬼不神’ [If its spirits are not potent].\"*\n\nWáng Zhù [王注] states: *\"When the Dao permeates, the spirits do not harm the people; if the spirits do not harm the people, they are no longer recognized as spirits. When the Dao permeates, the sage also does not harm the people; if the sage does not harm the people, they are no longer recognized as sage. Thus, it is said that neither the spirits are recognized as spirits, nor the sage as sage.\"*\n\nThis suggests the original text read: *\"Its potency does not harm the people; the sage also does not harm the people.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nJiāng Shì’s [江氏] tonal reading lacks rhyme.\n\nYáo Wéntián [姚文田] suggests: *\"Shén [神], shén [神], rén [人] rhyme (seventh true level tone).\"*\n\nGāo Běn Hàn agrees.\n\nXí Dòng: *\"Shén [神], shén [神], rén [人], rén [人], rén [人] rhyme.*\nChén Zhù: *\"Shén [神], shén [神], rén [人], rén [人], rén [人], yān [焉] rhyme.*\nQiān Zhī’s annotation: *\"Shén [神], rén [人], and yān [焉] rhyming is correct. Shén [神] and rén [人] belong to the *Zhēn* [真] rhyme category, while yān [焉] belongs to the *Yuán* [元] category, thus forming a *Yuán*-*Zhēn* rhyme interchange.\"*\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* stele version does not divide chapters, comprising **forty-seven characters**. The *Dūnhuáng* and *Héshàng* versions match this, while the *Wáng* and *Fàn* versions have **forty-eight characters**, and the *Fú* version has **forty-nine characters**.\n\nThe *Dūnhuáng* version titles this *\"Chapter on Governing a Great State\"*, the *Héshàng* version *\"Residing in Position, Sixty-First\"*, the *Wáng* version *\"Sixty-First Chapter\"*, and the *Fàn* version *\"Chapter on Governing a Great State, Sixty-First.\"*\n\n---\n**Sixty-First Chapter**\n*\"Great states are like the lower reaches of a river.\"*\n\nGāo Hēng states: *\"This sentence should read, ‘Governing a great state is like residing in the lower reaches.’ The transmitted text mistakenly omits the ‘if’ [若] and ‘residing’ [居] characters, while ‘residing’ [居] is further corrupted into ‘[great]’ [者].\"*\n\nThe *Héshàng* annotation reads: *\"Governing a great state should be like residing in the lower reaches.\"* Thus, the original *Héshàng* text was *\"Governing a great state is like residing in the lower reaches.\"* This is **Evidence One**.\n\nWáng’s annotation states:\n*\"The sea and rivers are vast yet positioned low, and thus all streams flow toward them. Great states, though vast, must also reside low, and thus all under Heaven flows toward them. Hence, it is said, ‘Great states are like the lower reaches.’\"*\n\nThe final sentence should read: *\"Hence, it is said, ‘Governing a great state is like residing in the lower reaches.’\"*—a transmitted error from omitted characters.\n\nClearly, Wáng likens the sea’s low position to that of a great state, thus interpreting the original *\"if\"* [若] and *\"residing\"* [居], with *\"residing low\"* [處下] elucidating *\"residing\"* [居]. This proves the *Wáng* version originally had *\"if\"* [若] and *\"residing\"* [居], without the erroneous *\"[great]\"* [者]. This is **Evidence Two**.\n\nThe *Shìwén* [释文] inserts the character *\"governing\"* [治] between *\"evil\"* [邪] and *\"female\"* [牝], noting: *\"Read as *Zhíliào* [直吏].\"* This confirms that Lù’s [陆] source—Wáng’s version—originally contained the *\"governing\"* [治] character. This is **Evidence Three**.\n\nThe passage *\"Governing a great state is like residing in the lower reaches\"* aligns in structure with the earlier chapter’s *\"Governing a great state is like simmering a small delicacy\"*—its text contains errors and omissions, rendering it unreadable as is.\n\nIn the *Yánghuò* [阳货] chapter of the *Analects* [论语], it states: *\"The Master abhorred those who dwelled in the lower reaches and slandered above.\"* In the *Zǐzhāng* [子张] chapter: *\"The Master abhorred dwelling in the lower reaches.\"* This confirms that *\"dwell in the lower reaches\"* [居下流] was a common ancient phrase.\n\nThose who dwell in the lower reaches dare not be self-satisfied or arrogant, hence the *Lǎozi* [老子] adopts it. *\"The junction of all under heaven is the female of all under heaven.\"* The male is always victorious over the female through stillness, and stillness is the lower.\n\n**Evidence One:** *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] reads *\"the female of all under heaven\"* [天下之牝], while the *Imperial Commentary* [御注] inserts *\"the junction\"* [之交], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] reads *\"the junction, the female\"* [之交牝]. The various texts all render *\"the female is always victorious over the male through stillness\"* [牝常以静胜牝], but the correct reading should be six characters: *\"the junction of all under heaven\"* [天下之交], *\"the female\"* [牝], *\"is always victorious over the male\"* [常以静胜牡], *\"and stillness is the lower\"* [以静为下]. Thus, it reads: *\"The junction of all under heaven is the female of all under heaven. The female is always victorious over the male through stillness, and stillness is the lower.\"*\n\n**Evidence Two:** *Yán Zūn* [严遵]’s version reads: *\"Great states are where all under heaven flows to, where all under heaven converges\"* [大国者，天下之所流，天下之所交], omitting the *\"always\"* [常] character and placing *\"the female\"* [牝] above *\"with\"* [以].\n\n**Evidence Three:** *Fàn* [范]’s version states: *\"The lower reaches of all under heaven are where all under heaven converges. The beast of all under heaven—the female is always victorious over the male through stillness, and with its stillness, it is the lower.\"* *Fù* [傅]’s version ends similarly to *Fàn*’s, but renders *\"stillness\"* [静] as *\"tranquility\"* [靖].\n\n**Evidence Four:** The *Bànqí* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Gǔhuān* [顾欢], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] versions read *\"the junction, the female\"* [天下之交牝], while the *Dūng* [敦煌] and *Suì* [遂州] versions omit *\"and stillness is the lower\"* [以静为下].\n\nAll versions differ; the *Stele Edition* [碑本] follows *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] except for the third sentence, where it adopts the *Shù* [诸] *Héshàng* [河上] versions’ *\"the female is always victorious over the male through stillness\"* [牝常以静胜牡].\n\n*\"The female of all under heaven\"* is akin to saying *\"the mother of all under heaven.\"* In Chapter Twenty-Five: *\"It is the mother of all under heaven.\"* The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines *\"mother\"* [母] as *\"nurturer\"* [牧]. *Duàn’s* annotation [段注] states: *\"Nurturer refers to one who nourishes others. By analogy, anything that can generate and give rise to what follows is called ‘mother.’\"* The female is the nurturing beast, the receptive one, and thus shares meaning with *\"mother\"* [母]. Later it states: *\"Great states merely desire to shelter and nourish all under heaven\"*—to shelter and nourish all under heaven is to speak of the female.\n\n*Wú Chéng* [吴澄]’s annotation reads: *\"The female does not move first to seek the male; the male always moves first to seek the female. The one who moves to seek invites harm, while the one who waits in stillness receives benefit, hence ‘the female is always victorious over the male through stillness.’ The one who moves to seek is above, while the one who waits in stillness is below, hence ‘stillness is the lower.’\"* *Wú’s* explanation is correct.\n\nFurther, *\"stillness\"* [静] appears as *\"\"* [净] in the *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] *Xīnběn* [辛本] and *\"tranquility\"* [靖] in *Fù*’s [傅] version. *\"Stillness\"* [静], *\"\"* [净], and *\"tranquility\"* [靖] are interchangeable. In *Xià Sǒng*’s [夏竦] *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* [古文四声韵], Volume Three, *\"stillness\"* [静] is cited from ancient *Lǎozi* [老子] texts. Volume Four also cites *\"\"* [净] from ancient *Lǎozi* [老子] texts, matching the usage under *\"\"* [净] in *Zhǔyǔn* [籀韵], though *\"tranquility\"* [靖] is absent. Thus, *\"tranquility\"* [靖] is the same as *\"\"* [净].\n\nAgain, regarding *\"junction\"* [交], it is the same as *\"交\"* in Chapter Sixty: *\"Hence, they can return and join.\"* *Wú Chéng* [吴澄] states: *\"‘Junction’ means ‘convergence.’ Great states are the convergence point of all small states, like the lower reaches of water, which are the convergence point of all waters under heaven.\"* Thus, the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] and *Gǔhuān* [顾欢] versions, along with the *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上] and *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] versions, are incorrect in rendering *\"junction\"* [交] as *\"outskirts\"* [郊] or *\"junction, the female\"* [交牝] together.\n\nTherefore, when great states are below small states, they take from the small states; when small states are below great states, they take from the great states. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] reads *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚], following the *Imperial Commentary* [御注]. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Imperial Commentary* [御注] and the *Dūngxiāng Xīnběn* [敦煌辛本] both render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚], with *\"and take\"* [而取] following.\n\n**Evidence Five:** The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gǔhuān* [顾欢], *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上], and *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] versions also render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚]. *Chéng Xuānyīng*’s [成玄英] commentary states: *\"Small states know their own inferiority, guard their boundaries in meekness, and gather under the great state, revering its winds and admiring its virtues.\"* He also states: *\"Small states use softness, hence they gather under great states; great states use humility, hence they win the affection of all states. Softness and humility are the same, but gathering and taking differ, hence it is said ‘or.’\"* Thus, *\"take\"* [取] in the latter part of *Chéng’s* commentary is also rendered *\"gather\"* [聚].\n\n**Evidence Six:** Below *\"take\"* [取], *Fù’s* [傅] version includes *\"at\"* [于]. *Láo Jiàn* [劳健] states: *\"The character ‘gather’ [聚] is often mistakenly rendered as ‘take’ [取] in the same sentence by various versions.\"* The *Kāiyuán* [开元] version, the *Dūngxiāng Tángxiě* [敦煌唐写] version, *Zhōu’s* [周] fragments, the *Dàozàng Lóngxīng Bēiběn* [道藏龙兴碑本], and the *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] version all correctly render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚].\n\n「*Gather* [聚] is akin to *attach and seek protection*—the same meaning as in the following chapter’s *\"The wicked are shunned by all\"* [不善，人所保]. All versions rendering it as *\"take\"* [取] must be errors for the character *ji* [积, ]. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"Ji [积, ], to accumulate.\"* Xu Shí [徐锴] notes: *\"Ancient texts used *ji* [积, ] for the same meaning as *jù* [聚, gather].\"* Since the Han dynasty, this character has been mistakenly used as *\"most\"* [最], as seen in Cài Zhàn’s [蔡湛] inscription *\"Three years of supreme merit\"* [三载勋最]. This must be due to scribes not recognizing *ji* [积, ]’s original meaning, arbitrarily removing the radical and writing *\"take\"* [取]. Commentators then forced interpretations, which do not hold.\n\n**Qián Zhì’s [谦之] note:** The character *\"take\"* [取] here carries the same meaning as *\"gather\"* [聚]. The first *\"take\"* [取] is a phonetic loan for *\"gather\"* [聚]. In the *Zuǒ Zhuan* [左传], *\"Taking people from the reeds and rushes\"* [取人于萑苻之泽] and in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *\"Heavenly Pivot\"* [天运], *\"Taking disciples to dwell beneath\"* [取弟子游居寝卧其下] both imply *\"gather.\"* The *Yìjīng* [易经] *Cuì* [萃] hexagram commentary states: *\"Gather to rectify\"* [聚以正也], with the *Shìwén* [释文] noting: *\"Xún [荀] renders it as *take* [取].\"* Thus, *\"take\"* [取] and *\"gather\"* [聚] are interchangeable; no character change is needed.\n\nThe second *\"take\"* [取] carries the meaning *\"gather at\"* [聚于], equivalent to *\"seek\"* [趣]. The *Shìmíng* [释名] explains: *\"Take [取], to seek [趣].\"* The *Hànshū* [汉书] *Wáng Jí* [王吉] commentary states: *\"Take [取], to advance and seek [进趣].\"* *\"Seek\"* [趣] means *\"to turn toward.\"* The *Huáinán Zǐ* [淮南子] *Yuándào* [原道] states: *\"Holding its essentials and returning to its natural tendency\"* [秉其要归之趣], meaning *\"to turn toward.\"* When a small state submits to a great state, it seeks [趣] the great state. Hence, *\"or submits to take\"* [或下以取] and *\"or submits as if taking\"* [或下而取].\n\nYán Kějūn [严可均] notes: The *Yùzhù* [御注] below renders it *\"or submits and gathers\"* [或下而聚], while *Héshàng* [河上], *Wáng Bì* [王弼], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] render it *\"or submits and takes\"* [而取]. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] version renders *\"with\"* [以] as *\"and\"* [而].\n\nBelow, the *Jìnglóng* [景龙], *Jìngfú* [景福], and *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] versions all render it as *\"as if\"* [如], while the *Xīn* [辛] version renders it as *\"and\"* [而]. **Qián Zhì’s note:** The *Fù* [傅] version lacks the *\"thus\"* [故] character. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gǔ Huān* [顾欢], *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上], and *Zhào Zhì* [赵至] versions render the second *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚]. *Yán Zūn* [严遵]’s version reads: *\"Thus, or submits and takes, or submits and takes from others\"* [故或下而取，或下而取于人].\n\nYú Yì [俞樾] notes: In ancient texts, *\"with\"* [以] and *\"and\"* [而] were interchangeable. The *Zhōuyì* [周易] *Tóngrén* [同人] *Xiàngzhuàn* [象传] states: *\"Cultivated and vigorous, central and responsive\"* [文明以健，中正而应]. The *Xìcí Zhuàn* [系辞传] states: *\"The virtue of the stalks is round and divine, the virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing\"* [蓍之德圆而神，卦之德方以知]. The *Zuǒ Zhuan* [左传], *Zhāo* [昭] Eleventh Year, states: *\"Jie amassed wealth and lost his state, Zhou amassed the Eastern Yi and perished\"* [桀克有缗以丧其国，纣克东夷而陨其身]. *Mèngzǐ*’s *Gàozǐ* [告子] states: *\"The kings of Qin and Chu delighted in profit and dismissed their armies\"* [秦、楚之王悦于利，以罢三军之师]; *\"The kings of Qin and Chu delighted in virtue and dismissed their armies\"* [秦、楚之王悦于仁义，而罢三军之师]. All examples show *\"with\"* [以] and *\"and\"* [而] used interchangeably.\n\n*\"Great states submit to small states and take small states; small states submit to great states and take great states\"* is equivalent to *\"Great states, submitting to small states, take small states; small states, submitting to great states, take great states.\"* Thus, *\"or submits to take, or submits and takes\"* [或下以取，或下而取] carries identical meaning, suggesting textual corruption.\n\nGreat states merely seek to encompass others; small states merely seek to serve others. These two desires, when fulfilled, make submission fitting. **Yán Kějūn** notes: *Héshàng* [河上] and *Wáng Bì* [王弼] render *\"these two\"* [此两者] as *\"these\"* [夫], while *Gāo Yì* [高翿] omits *\"these\"* entirely. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jìngfú* [景福] and *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] versions lack *\"these two\"* [夫两者]. The *Yùzhù* [御注] and *Dūngxiāng Xīn* [敦煌辛] versions include *\"thus\"* [故] before *\"great states\"* [大者].\n\n**Qián Zhì’s note:** *Xíng Xuán* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Péng* [彭], *Fàn* [范], *Zhào* [赵], and *Gāo* [高] versions lack *\"these\"* [此] but include *\"thus\"* [故]. *Fàn* [范] renders it: *\"Thus, great states should submit\"* [故大国者宜为下].\n\nThis chapter’s *Wǔnèi Dùnběn* [武内敦本] and *Luó Juàn Xīn* [罗卷辛本] align, differing from the *Běn* [本]. **[Phonology]** This chapter lacks rhyme in *Jiāng Shì*’s [江氏] readings; all versions agree. *Chén Zhù* [陈柱] notes: The four *\"state\"* [国] characters rhyme, as do the two *\"people\"* [人] characters.\n\nThe *Jìnglóng Bēiběn* [景龙碑本] does not divide chapters, containing 82 characters. The *Dūngxiāng Xīn* [敦煌辛] version has 80 characters; *Héshàng* [河上] and *Wáng* [王] versions have 82; the *Fù* [傅] version has 89; the *Fàn* [范] version has 91. The *Héshàng* [河上] version is titled *\"Chapter Sixty-One: Virtue of Submission\"* [谦德第六十一]; the *Wáng* [王] version is *\"Chapter Sixty-One\"* [六十一章]; the *Fàn* [范] version is *\"Great States as the Lowest Flow of the World: Chapter Sixty-One\"* [大国者天下之下流章第六十一].\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two:**\n*The Dao is the profound essence of all things.*\n\n**Qián Zhì’s note:** The *Luó Juàn* [罗卷] and *Fàn* [范] versions agree. The *Péng* [彭] and *Fù* [傅] versions include *\"thus\"* [也] below, as does the *Hòuhànshū* [后汉书] *Féng Kàn* [冯衍] commentary citation.\n\nThe character *\"profound\"* [奥] is defined in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* as: *\"○, *wǎn* [宛], the southwest corner of a room.\"* *Xià Jùn* [夏竦]’s *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* [古文四声韵] Vol. 4 lists *\"profound\"* [奥], *\"discontent\"* [懊], *\"Austria\"* [墺], and *\"corner\"* [隩], noting the latter three appear in ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] texts, while *\"profound\"* [奥] lacks citation, suggesting the original may have had a different radical.\n\nThe *Shūjìng Yáodiǎn* [书经尧典] states *\"His people were *zhuì* [隩]\"* [厥民隩], while *Sīmǎ Qiān* [司马迁] renders it *\"yào* [燠].\"* *Mǎ Róng* [马融] explains: *\"Zhuì [隩], warm.\"* *Sūn Xīngyǎn* [孙星衍]’s commentary states: *\"Sīmǎ Qiān [司马迁] renders *zhuì* [隩] as *yào* [燠] because the *Lǎozǐ* *Shìwén* [释文] states: *‘Profound [奥], warm.’*\"* Thus, *\"zhuì\"* [隩] and *\"profound\"* [奥] are interchangeable, and *\"yào\"* [燠] shares the meaning of *\"warm.\"* However, *\"profound\"* [奥] also means *\"hidden.\"* The *Guǎngyà* [广雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] states: *\"Profound [奥], to hide.\"* *Héshàng* [河上]’s commentary explains: *\"Profound [奥], to hide.\"*\n\n「The Dao/Way is the repository [藏] of all things, containing nothing it does not embrace [無所不容也].」 *Péng Zhì* [彭耜]’s *Shìwén* [释文] states: *«\"Profound [奥],\"* from the pronunciation *Lǐ Wū-bào* [李乌报]. It says the Dao/Way’s essence has no external limit, while all things draw sustenance from within its profound depths [奧中].»* The *Sù Shū Jìjié Zhì* [隋书经籍志] states *«The Dao/Way is indeed the profound depths [奧] of all things»*, echoing this passage. Combining these two meanings, the Dao/Way is the profound depths [奧] of all things—that is, the source of their warmth and shelter.\n\n*Gāo Hēng* [高亨] explains: *«○, a hidden valley [藏谷], from [谷], bearing grains within its hollows [穴中].»* This is incorrect.\n\nThe *Zìjiàn* [字鉴] states: *«Profound [奥], pronounced *Yú-Dào* [于到], meaning \"deep\" [深], from [采] and [从]. Its sound is *gǒng* [拱], now written as 大 [大], a vulgar form. The middle component of the character is mistakenly from [米粟] (grain).»* The correct pronunciation is *gǒng* [拱], and the character should be understood as \"deep.\"\n\nGoodness [善] is the treasure [宝] of humankind; wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [人之所不保]. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] states: *«Wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [所不保]»*, though other versions read *«所保»*. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Xīběn* [敦煌辛本] has *«不»* beneath *«所»*. *Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] argues that the *Dūn* [敦], *Jǐng* [景], and *Suì* [遂] versions all read *«所不保»*, and *«不»* may be a duplication. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] and *Zhào Zhìjiān* [赵志坚] also render it *«所不保»*, but with *«保»* as *«宝»*. *Yǐn Wénzǐ Dàdào Piān* [尹文子大道篇] cites *«wickedness [不善] is what humankind treasures [所宝]»*, where the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions have *«所»* but lack *«不»*. Today’s analysis: This passage should be punctuated as *«Goodness [善] / Wickedness [不善]»*, for the Dao/Way encompasses the sheltering [庇荫] of all things—both goodness and wickedness reside within its depths. Yet humans cannot remain indifferent; goodness is what humankind treasures, hence *«treasure it and uphold it»* [宝而持之], meaning to cling steadfastly to it. *«Wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [所不保]»*—wickedness, then, is what humankind rejects and does not embrace. In *Zhuāngzǐ Liè Yùlǘu Piān* [庄子列御寇篇], *«人将保汝矣»*, *Sīmǎ* [司马] notes: *«保 [保], to attach oneself [附].»* Thus, *«不保»* means humankind will not attach itself to wickedness.\n\nFine words can be used to purchase honor [市尊], and virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [加人]. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: The *Fù* [傅] version reads *«Fine words can be used in the marketplace [美言可以于市], honorable words can enhance one’s standing [尊言可以加于人]»*, while the *Fàn* [范] version agrees, except *«言»* is replaced by *«行»*, with the note: *«Perhaps a character is missing above \"市 [marketplace]\".»*» This passage has been frequently miscopied, as seen in the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions. The *Huáinánzǐ Rénjiān Xuàn* [淮南子人间训] and *Dàoyìng Xuàn* [道应训] both cite it correctly as *«Fine words can be used to purchase honor [美言可以市尊], virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [美行可以加人].»* Thus, the current version can be corrected accordingly. *Yú Tàoshuò* [俞樾] states: *«According to the *Huáinánzǐ Dàoyìng Xuàn* [淮南子道应训] and *Rénjiān Xuàn* [人间训], the current version is missing a \"美 [fine]\" character.»* However, the *Rénjiān Xuàn* [人间训] cites *«君子曰»*, and *Wáng Niǎnsūn* [王念孙] argues: *«君子 [Noble One] originally read \"老子 [Lǎozǐ],\" a superficial scholar’s alteration.»* Now, *Lǎozǐ* [老子] reads *«Fine words can be used to purchase honor [美言可以市], virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [尊行可以加人],»* without the *«美»* beneath *«行»*, and the sentence ends with *«市»*, with *«尊»* beginning the next. The *Dàoyìng Piān* [道应篇] also cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] with *«美»* beneath *«行»*, indicating the versions seen differ. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: This passage pairs *«Fine words [美言]»* with *«Virtuous deeds [美行]»*, and *«尊 [honor]»* and *«人 [one’s standing]»* rhyme in *Zhēn* [真] and *Wén* [文] tones, aligning with the *Huáinánzǐ* [淮南子]’s poetic structure.\n\nWhy then is wickedness [不善] ever discarded? *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Xīběn* [敦煌辛本] reads *«奚 [deliberate]»* instead of *«何 [why]»*. *«弃 [discard]»* is rendered *«奚»* in the *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gùhuān* [顾欢], and *Zhào Zhìjiān* [赵志坚] versions, while the *Gù* [顾] version’s *Chéngshū* [成疏] states: *«奚 [deliberate], why [何].»* Other versions cite *«何 [why]»*. Since fine words and virtuous deeds are valued by humankind, wickedness can be transformed by learning from goodness, thus progressing toward virtue. Hence, it is said *«Why then is wickedness ever discarded [奚弃之有]?»*\n\nTherefore, even when establishing the Son of Heaven [立天子] and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers [置三公], though one may offer a *gǒngbì* [拱璧] (a ceremonial jade tablet) before four steeds [先驷马], it is not as valuable as advancing this Dao/Way. *Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] argues: *«拱璧 [gǒngbì]* is rendered as *«供之璧 [offer it as a jade tablet]»* in the *Dūn* [敦] version, and *«之»* may be a duplication. *«驷马 [four steeds]»* is also written as *«四马 [four steeds]».»* *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: The *Zuǒzhuan Xiāngshíjiǔnián Zhèngyì* [左传襄十九年正义] cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] as *«Though one may offer a jade tablet held in both hands [拱抱之璧] to precede four steeds [以先驷马].»* *«拱抱之璧 [gǒngbì]* aligns with *Wáng Zhǔ* [王注]’s *«拱抱宝璧 [ceremonial jade tablet]».»* *Yì Shùndīng* [易顺鼎] rejects this, stating: *«In *Zuǒzhuan Xiāngsānshíyīnián* [左传襄三十一年], *\"Chú Zhòng Dài* [叔仲带] stole the ceremonial jade tablet [窃其拱璧],\"* and *Dù Zhù* [杜注] explains: *«拱璧 [gǒngbì], a grand jade tablet [公大璧].»* The *Yùpiān* [玉篇] states: *«珙 [gǒng], a grand jade tablet [大璧].»* Thus, *«拱璧 [gǒngbì]* is *«珙璧 [gǒngbì]».»* The *Fàn* [范] version correctly reads *«珙璧 [gǒngbì]».*\n\nWhy was the Dao/Way held in such esteem in antiquity? Not because it is sought and obtained [不曰求以得], nor because it wards off evil through effort [有罪以勉], but because it is thereby esteemed throughout the world [故为天下贵]. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] states: *«不日求以得 [Not because it is sought and obtained]»*, where the *Héshàng* [河上] and *Wáng Bì* [王弼] versions place *«求 [seek]»* beneath *«以 [and]»*, and *Gāo Xiè* [高翿] renders *«日 [say]»* as *«曰 [say]»*. *«有罪以勉 [Wards off evil through effort]»* is written as *«以免邪 [to ward off evil]»* in other versions, while *Gāo Xiè* [高翿] renders it *«不免邪 [does not ward off evil]».* *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Gēngběn* [敦煌庚本] lacks *«何 [why]»*, while the *Xīn* [辛] and *Rén* [壬] versions include it. The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Yùzhù* [御注], *Dūnhuáng Gēng* [敦煌庚], and *Xīn* [辛] versions all read *«求以得 [seek and obtain]»*, while the *Wáng* [王] and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions read *«以求得 [to seek and obtain]».* The *Gēng* [庚] version has *«之 [it]»* beneath *«得 [obtain]»*. Additionally, the *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* [敦煌辛] versions lack *«也 [also]»*.\n\n毕沅曰：Héshàng Gōng [河上公] 作「日」，Wáng Bì [王弼] 作「不曰以求得」。Chén Bìxū [陈碧虚] 曰：古本作「不曰求以得」，Yán Jūn Píng [严君平] 作「不求而自得」。Qiān zhī [谦之] 案：譣碑文，「日」亦作「曰」，严校误。Luó Juàn [罗卷]、Fù [傅]、Fàn [范]、Péng [彭]、Wáng Xīzhī [王羲之]、Zhào Mèngfǔ [赵孟俯] 均作「曰」，Yùzhù [御注]、Pán Xī [磻溪]、Jǐngfú [景福]、Lóu Zhèng [楼正]、Shìtíng [室町]、Náijuàn [柰卷]、Gù Huān [顾欢] 作「日」，作「日」讹。\n\nYú Yì [俞樾] 曰：Táng Jǐnglóng [唐景龙] 碑及 Fù Yì [傅奕] 本并作「求以得」，正与「有罪以免」相对成文，当从之。「古之所以贵此道者何」九字为句，乃设为问辞以晓人也。「不曰求以得，有罪以免邪」，言人能修 Dao/Way [道] 则所求者可以得，有罪者可以免也。「不曰」字「邪」字相应，犹言岂不以此邪，谦不敢质言也。下云「故为天下贵」，则自问还自答也。Héshàng Gōng [河上公] 本「不曰」误作「不日」，因曲为之说曰「不日日远行求索，近待于身」，失其义矣。\n\n谦之又案：此文「贵」字有二义。说文：「贵，物不贱也。」此可训上一「贵」字。Lǎozǐ [老子]「不贵难得之货」，Wáng zhù [王注]「隆之称也」是也。下一「贵」字，从声训为归。Chū Xué Jì [初学记] 引说文：「汝、颖言『贵』声如『归』。」又Shì Míng [释名] 释言语：「贵，归也，物所归仰也。汝、颖言贵声如『归往』之归也。」此言「为天下贵」，即为天下所归往也。旧解作「尊贵」之贵，非。\n\n【音韵】此章Jiāng Shì [江氏] 韵读：奥、宝、保韵（幽部，奥，胡叟反，宝音○）。Dèng Tíngzhēn [邓廷桢] 同。Xí Dòng [奚侗]、Chén Zhù [陈柱]、Gāo Běnhàn [高本汉] 增尊、人为韵。\n\nDeliberately omitted the overlapping section as requested.\n\n---\n\nQí [奚] remarked:\n*\"The transmitted texts below ‘捝’ [捝] all sever ‘美言可以市’ [‘beautiful words can be sold’] and ‘尊行可以加人’ [‘noble conduct can elevate others’] as separate sentences—this is grossly mistaken. Here, following the *Huáinán Dàoyīng* [淮南道应训] and *Rénjiān Dàoyīng* [人间训] citations, I restore the original pairing, for these are both parallel and rhyming phrases.\"*\n\nLáo Jiàn [劳健] further noted:\n*\"‘坐进此道’ [‘to embrace this Dao/Way’], where ‘道’ [Dao] rhymes with ‘有’ [‘possess’] and ‘马’ [‘horse’] above.\"*\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] observed:\n*\"‘马’ [horse], in ancient pronunciation, was *mǎo* [姥].\"*\n\nThe *Zūn* [尊] and *rén* [人] characters belong to the *Wén* [文] and *Zhēn* [真] rhyme groups. The *Guǎngyùn* [广韵] erroneously placed *zūn* [尊] under the *Xiǎn* [霰] rhyme, claiming it was pronounced like *zhèn* [镇].\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] stele version presents this as a single passage of eighty characters. The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] manuscript has eighty-one, the *Hé* [河] and *Wáng* [王] versions eighty, and the *Fù* [傅] version eighty-five, while the *Fàn* [范] version has eighty-three. The *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] edition titles it *“For the Dao, Chapter Sixty-Two”* [为道第六十二], the *Wáng* [王] version *“Chapter Sixty-Two”* [六十二章], and the *Fàn* [范] version *“The Dao as the Mysterious Origin of All Things, Chapter Sixty-Two”* [道者万物之奥章第六十二].\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n*\"To act without action,\nTo take care of affairs without meddling,\nTo savor the flavorless.\"*\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes:\n*\"Chéng Xuányīng’s [成玄英] commentary on *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *Xiāoyáo Yóu* [逍遥游], the *Hòuhàn Shū* [后汉书] *Xuàn Shuāng* [荀爽] biography, and the *Wénzǐ* *Dàoyuán* [文子道原] all cite the first two lines identically. The third line, however, appears as ‘知不知也’ [‘to know the unknown’] in the *Wénzǐ* citation, suggesting ‘味’ [flavor] may be a corrupted inversion of ‘知’ [know].\"*\n\n*\"To know the unknown\"* aligns with the intent of *Chapter Seventy-One*’s *\"Knowing the unknown is superior.\"*\n\n*\"Great and small, much and little—*\n*Repaying resentment with virtue.\"*\n\nYáo Nài [姚鼐] remarked:\n*\"The phrase ‘大小多少’ [great/small, much/little] likely omits a critical character, rendering forced interpretations untenable.\"*\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] countered:\n*\"‘大小多少’ [great/small, much/little] directly corresponds to the subsequent passage: ‘The most arduous tasks in the world begin with what is easy; great undertakings originate from the minute.’ Its meaning is thus self-evident.\"*\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four*’s *\"A nine-tiered tower begins with a clod of earth;\nA journey of a thousand *lǐ* commences beneath one’s feet\"* likewise embodies this principle.\n\n*\"This teaches that the great arises from the small, and abundance from scarcity.\"*\n\n*Hán Fēi* [韩非] similarly stated:\n*\"All formed things, great in scale, must originate from the minute;\nAll enduring lineages, vast in number, must emerge from the few.\"*\n\nUpon further examination, the phrase *\"reporting resentment with virtue\"* [报怨以德] is cited in Liu Xiang’s *New Sequel: Miscellaneous Matters* [新序·杂事四].\n\nIn the *Analects*, Chapter *Xianwen* [憲問], it is recorded:\n*\"Someone asked: ‘How about repaying resentment with virtue?’ The Master said: ‘How then should one repay virtue? One repays resentment with justice, and virtue with virtue.’\"*\n\nKang Youwei, in *Confucius as Reformer* [孔子改制考], asserted:\n*\"The doctrine of repaying resentment with virtue originates from Laozi.\"*\n\n---\nThe difficult arises from the easy; the great from the minute.\n\nYan Ru [严可均] notes that all editions include the character *\"its\"* [其] after *\"from\"* [于].\n\n Luo Zhenyu [罗振玉] observes that the *Jinglong* [景龙] and *Dunhuang Xin* [敦煌辛] manuscripts omit *\"its\"* [其].\n\nQian Zhi [谦之] examines the matter: In *Han Fei Zi*’s *Yu Lao* [喻老] and *Nan* [难] chapters, as well as in the *Continuation of the History of the Han*’s *Five Phases Annals* [后汉书·五行志] citing *Ma Rong’s* [马融] works, the character *\"its\"* [其] appears. The *Fu* [傅] and *Fan* [范] editions further include *\"then\"* [乎] before *\"its\"* [于其]. However, the *Seizhou* [遂州], *Yan Zhen* [严遵], *Gu Huan* [顾欢], *Qiang* [强] commentaries, *Cheng Shu* [成疏], *Rong Zhu* [荣注], and citations in *Yi Lin* [艺林] omit *\"its\"* [其].\n\n---\nThe world’s most arduous tasks must begin with what is easy;\nThe world’s greatest undertakings must originate from what is minute.\n\n武 Nei Yiyong states: The *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* manuscripts render *\"minute\"* [细] as *\"small\"* [小].\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Dunhuang Xin* manuscript omits the phrase *\"the world’s\"* [天下].\n\nQian Zhi examines: According to the *Zhensongtang* collection of *Xichui Secret Scriptures*, the *Dunhuang Ren* manuscript retains *\"the world’s\"* [天下], whereas the *Suizhou* manuscript omits it. Additionally, the *Peng*, *Zhao*, *Fu*, and *Fan* editions, as well as the *Yu Lao* chapter of *Han Fei Zi*, all include the character *\"the\"* [之] before *\"arduous tasks\"* [难事] and *\"great undertakings\"* [大事].\n\nThe *Yan* edition presents the two sentences as *\"arduous tasks originate from ease; great undertakings originate from the minute\"*, while Gao Yi renders *\"minute\"* [细] as *\"○\"* [空缺].\n\nThus, the Sage never undertakes what is great, and thereby accomplishes what is great.\n\nWu Nei Yiyong states: The *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* manuscripts omit these two sentences.\nQian Zhi examines: The *Dunhuang Ren* manuscript includes them.\nXi Dong remarks: These two sentences appear in Chapter Thirty-Four and are repeated here.\n\nHe who lightly promises must be few in trustworthiness; he who multiplies ease must encounter many difficulties. Therefore, even the Sage finds difficulty in this, and thus ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Thus ultimately faces no difficulty\"* [故终无难], Wang Bi renders as *\"faces no difficulty\"* [无难矣].\nWei Jiaosun states: *\"Finds difficulty\"* [犹难], the *Imperial Commentary* renders *\"犹\"* as *\"由\"* [by].\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, *Jingfu*, and *Dunhuang Geng*, *Xin*, and *Ren* manuscripts all omit the character *\"矣\"* [矣].\nQian Zhi examines: The *Yan Zhen* edition omits *\"夫\"* [夫], and both instances of *\"必\"* [必] are preceded by *\"者\"* [者], aligning with the *Fu* and *Fan* editions.\n\nThe *Suizhou*, *Panxi*, *Lou Zheng*, *Yan*, *Gu*, *He Shang*, *Nai Juan*, *Wang Xizhi*, and *Gao Yi* editions likewise omit *\"矣\"* [矣], consistent with this stone inscription.\n\n**[Rhymes]**\nJiang Shi’s tonal reading of this chapter lacks rhyme.\nXi Dong: *\"For\"* [为] and *\"flavor\"* [味] rhyme; *\"ease\"* [易], *\"minute\"* [细], *\"ease\"* [易], *\"minute\"* [细], *\"great\"* [大], *\"great\"* [大] rhyme.\nExamined: *\"For\"* [为] and *\"flavor\"* [味] are not actually rhyming.\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele edition contains seventy-six characters; the *Dunhuang* edition, seventy-one; the *He Shang* edition, seventy-eight; the *Wang* edition, seventy-nine; the *Fu* edition, eighty-five; and the *Fan* edition, eighty-four.\nThe *He Shang* edition is titled *\"Enshi Chapter Sixty-Three\"* [恩始第六十三]; the *Wang* edition, *\"Chapter Sixty-Three\"* [六十三章]; the *Fan* edition, *\"Chapter Sixty-Three of *Wuwei*\"* [为无为章第六十三].\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\nThat which is settled is easy to hold;\nThat which has not yet appeared is easy to plan;\nThat which is fragile is easy to shatter;\nThat which is subtle is easy to disperse.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"That which is fragile\"* [其脆易破], the *He Shang* edition renders as *\"fragile\"* [其脆], while Wang Bi renders as *\"easy to disperse\"* [易泮].\nLuo Zhenyu notes: *\"Easy to disperse\"* [易泮], the *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, *Jingfu*, and *Dunhuang Geng*, *Xin*, and *Ren* manuscripts all render as *\"shatter\"* [破].\nWu Nei Yiyong states: The *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* manuscripts render *\"fragile\"* [脆] as *\"毳\"* [毳].\n\nQian Zhi examines: The *Fan* edition renders *\"fragile\"* [脆] as *\"○\"* [空缺], and *\"shatter\"* [破] aligns with the *Fu* edition’s *\"judge\"* [判].\nFan states: *\"Judge\"* [判] means *\"divide\"* [分]. Wang Bi and Sima Gong follow the ancient edition.\nThus, the *Fan* edition’s *Wang* text reads *\"judge\"* [判].\n*\"Dispersion\"* [泮] and *\"judgment\"* [判] are interchangeable characters.\n\nThe *Suizhou*, *Xing Xuan*, *Panxi*, *Lou Zheng*, *Nai Juan*, *He Shang*, *Yan*, *Gu*, *Zhao*, and *Zhi Yao* citations all render as *\"shatter\"* [破].\nAdditionally, *\"fragile\"* [脆] is rendered as *\"毳\"* [毳] in the *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* manuscripts.\nThe *Release Text* states: *\"The He Shang edition renders as ‘fragile’* [脆].\"\nIn Chapter Seventy-Six, *\"All things, grasses, and trees in their growth are tender and fragile\"* [万物草木之生也柔脆], the *Suizhou* edition renders as *\"tender and 毳\"* [柔毳].\n*\"Fragile\"* [脆] is the *\"say\"* [说] character in the *Shuowen Jiezi*.\nThe *Yiqie Jingyin* Volume Fourteen cites the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s *\"say\"* [说] as *\"small and easily broken\"* [小耎易断也], while Volume Thirty-Two cites it as *\"slight flesh, easily broken\"* [少肉耎易断也], matching the *Er Xu* editions and *Yupian* citations.\nOnly Volume Three includes *\"or rendered as ‘fragile’* [或作脆],\"* and Tian Qian’s *Shuowen Jian* Volume Four posits that *\"○\"* [空缺] is an alternate form of *\"say\"* [说].\nThe *Er Xu* editions define *\"fragile\"* [脆] as *\"easily broken\"* [耎易破也], treating it as a separate character.\nThe *Zhouli Release Text* states that the character books lack the *\"say\"* [说] character but include *\"fragile\"* [脆].\nLi Shan, in the *Wei Dou* and *Qifā*, cites these two characters, confirming their existence.\nHuilin’s citation of *\"or rendered as ‘fragile’* [或作脆]\" further proves that *\"say\"* [说] and *\"fragile\"* [脆] are one character.\nThe *Yupian*’s phonetic and semantic entries for *\"say\"* [说] and *\"fragile\"* [脆] are identical, offering another confirmation.\nHowever, *\"fragile\"* [脆] should follow the *Fan* edition’s *\"say\"* [说], as *\"fragile\"* [脆] is the vulgar form.\n*\"毳\"* [毳] should follow the ancient text’s rendering as *\"fragile\"* [脆].\nXia Jun’s *Ancient *Laozi* Four-Tone Rhymes* Volume Five cites the ancient *Laozi* as rendering it *\"say\"* [说].\n\nTo act when there is yet nothing to act upon,\nTo govern when there is yet no disorder—○.\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Dunhuang Geng* manuscript includes the character *\"its\"* [其] after *\"upon\"* [于].\nQian Zhi examines: Jia Yi’s *New Book of Strategies*’ *Examining the Subtle* chapter cites Lao Dan with this stone’s text.\nThe *Fu* and *Fan* editions render both *\"upon\"* [于] as *\"乎\"* [乎], while the *Shiji*’s *Su Qin Transmission* renders *\"upon\"* [于] as *\"its\"* [其], with *\"also\"* [也] following.\nThe *Wu志*’s *Sun Ce Transmission* aligns with the *Dunhuang* edition.\nThe *Yan Zhen* edition omits both *\"upon\"* [于].\n\nAdditionally, Dai Tian’s *Da Tian Qingxuan* states: *\"The *Shuowen Jiezi*’s *Zhou Officials*: ‘Establish governance before chaos arises; preserve the state before danger manifests.’\"* Wang Xizhuang’s later annotation posits this as a use of this chapter’s language.\nFurthermore, the *Jinglong*, *Luo Juan*, and *Nai Juan* manuscripts render *\"disorder\"* [乱] as *\"○\"* [空缺], a vulgar character.\nExamined in *Zijiàn*: *\"Disorder\"* [乱], the *Shuowen Jiezi* is composed of *\"乙\"* [yǐ] and *\"○\"* [空缺].

The *Zìlín* [字林] states: *“稽”* [jī] means “to linger” or “to stop.” The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] defines it as “to linger,” “to govern,” “to consider,” “to unite,” or “to meet expectations.” None of these meanings apply here. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] also notes: *“稽式”* [jīshì] is *“楷式”* [kēshì]. The *Lǐjì* [礼记] says: *“今世之行，后世以为楷”* [The conduct of this age is taken as a model by future generations]. The *Guǎngyǎ Shìgǔ* [广雅·释诂] states: *“楷”* [kē] means “law” or “pattern.” Thus *“楷式”* [kēshì] is *“法式”* [fǎshì, \"pattern of law\"], a meaning that is more expansive. In inscriptions, *“楷”* [kē] is written as *“揩”* [kē], but according to *Zìlín* [字林], *“揩”* [kē] means “to rub.” The *Guǎngyǎ Shìgǔ* [广雅·释诂] further clarifies: *“揩”* [kē] is “to grind.” This differs from *“楷”* [kē], so we should follow the **Liùcháo** [六朝] manuscripts and the **Táng** [唐] versions, which render it as *“楷”* [kē].\n\n**Mǎ Qícháng** [马其昶] states: *“楷式”* [kēshì] follows the phrase *“古之善为道者”* [Those ancient who excelled in the **Dao/Way**]. Indeed, the two cases—governing with wisdom and not governing with wisdom—both were known in antiquity, and each had its own **pattern** [楷式] to emulate. One who **knows the pattern** [能知] and acts in accordance with the **natural order** [大顺] of things, reversing the **Dao/Way** to align with reality, is then said to possess **supreme virtue/power** [玄德]. **Supreme virtue/power** [玄德] is profound and distant, reversing the **Dao/Way** to align with reality, and thus attaining the **natural order** [大顺].\n**Yán Kějūn** [严可均] notes: *“深远”* [shēnyuǎn, \"profound and distant\"] and *“与物反”* [yùwùfǎn, \"reverse to align with reality\"] are rendered as *“深矣远矣，与物反矣”* [shēnyǔyuǎn yǔ, yùwùfǎn yǔ, \"profound indeed, distant indeed, reverse to align with reality indeed\"] in other versions.\n**Luó Zhènyù** [罗振玉] observes: The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] version and the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] *Xīn* [辛] version render it as *“深远”* [shēnyuǎn], while the *Gēng* [庚] version renders it as *“深矣远”* [shēnyǔyuǎn].

The *Wénzǐ Dàodé* [文子道德] citation reads: *“Dwells above yet the people do not feel burdened”* [居上而民不重], *“stands before yet the multitude is not harmed”* [居前而眾不害], *“therefore the world gladly follows without surfeit”* [天下樂推而不厌].\n\nThe *Yánzūn* [嚴遵] version states: *“Thus, when in high station, the people do not feel burdened”* [故在上而民不重], *“when dwelling before the people, they are not harmed”* [居民之前而民不害], *“therefore the world gladly follows and ascends to him without surfeit”* [天下樂推而上之而不知厌].\n\n**Fù Yì** [傅奕]’s version reads: *“Thus, the **Sage** dwells above yet the people do not hold him in burden”* [是以聖人處之上而民弗重], *“dwells before yet the people are not harmed”* [處之前而民不害也], *“therefore the world gladly follows without surfeit”* [是以天下樂推而不厌]. The *Fàn* [范] version is identical, except *“not”* [不] is rendered *“do not”* [弗], and *“also”* [也] is omitted.\n\n**Gāo Hēng** [高亨] explains: *“The people bear their ruler like a heavy load”* [民戴其君], *“as if burdened”* [若有重負], *“deeming it a great encumbrance”* [以為大累]—this is what *“burdened”* [重] refers to. Thus, *“burdened”* [重] is synonymous with *“encumbered”* [累]. Evidence for this usage appears in the *“Odes”* [詩] *“Without pondering a hundred cares”* [無思百憂], *“only bearing my own weight”* [祇自重兮], where the *Zhèng Jiàn* [鄭箋] glosses *“weight”* [重] as *“encumbrance”* [累]. The *Hànshū Jīng-Yān Wú-Wáng Zhuàn* [漢書荊燕吴王傳] *“matters overlapping”* [事發相重], is annotated by *Yán Zhù* [顏注] as *“overlapping”* [重] meaning *“encumbrance”* [累]. This confirms *“burdened”* [重] carries the sense of *“encumbrance”* [累].\n\nThe *Huáinánzǐ Yuándào Piān* [淮南子原道篇] states: *“Dwells above yet the people do not hold him in burden”* [處上而民弗重], *“stands before yet the people are not harmed”* [居前而民弗害].\n\nThe *Zhǔshù Xuàn* [主術訓] elaborates: *“The common folk bear him, yet he is not a burden”* [百姓載之，上弗重也]; *“They err, yet he does not harm them”* [錯之，前弗害也]. These are all rooted in **Lǎozǐ** [老子].\n\nBecause he does not contend, none contend with him.\n\n**Luó Zhènyù** [羅振玉] notes: The *Dūnhuáng Rén* [敦煌壬] manuscript appends *“also”* [也] after *“contend”* [爭], while the *Xīn* [辛] version renders *“not”* [不] as *“none”* [無], and the *Rén* [壬] version reads *“not because of his non-contention”* [非以其不爭].\n\n**Qiānzhī** [謙之] examines: The *Wáng* [王] and *Héshàng* [河上] versions render *“none contend with him”* [莫能與之爭], while the *Fù* [傅] version prefaces the first sentence with *“not”* [不]. The *Fàn* [范] version renders *“not because of his”* [不以其] instead of *“because of his”* [以其不], and the *Yán* [嚴] version reads *“not because”* [非以].\n\nAdditionally, the *Qiáng* [強] version’s *Chéngshū* [成疏] and *Róng Zhù* [榮注] citations align with the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* [敦煌辛] manuscript.\n\n---\n**Chapter 67: The World All Deems Me Great, Unworthy**\n\n**Yán Kějūn** [嚴可均] notes: *“Me great”* [我大], **Wáng Bì** [王弼] renders as *“My **Dao/Way** is great”* [我道大]. *“Unworthy”* [不肖], all versions include *“seem”* [似] above and below *“thus unworthy”* [故不肖].\n\n**Luó Zhènyù** [羅振玉] notes: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* [敦煌辛] manuscript renders *“deems”* [謂] as *“considers”* [以].\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* [景龍], *Yùzhù* [御注], *Jǐngfú* [景福], *Dūnhuáng Gēng* [敦煌庚], *Xīn* [辛], and *Rén* [壬] manuscripts all omit *“**Dao/Way**”* [道]. *“Unworthy”* [不肖], the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* [敦煌辛] manuscript renders *“laugh”* [笑] for *“unworthy”* [肖], and the same applies to the two subsequent *“unworthy”* [肖] characters. The *Yìshū Héshàng* [義疏河上] version also renders *“unworthy”* [肖] as *“laugh”* [笑].\n\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** [武內義雄] notes: The *Dūn* [敦], *Jǐng* [景], and *Suì* [遂] manuscripts omit *“seem”* [似]. The *Dūn* [敦] and *Suì* [遂] manuscripts render *“unworthy”* [肖] as *“laugh”* [笑].\n\n**Qiānzhī** [謙之] examines: The *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions render *“me”* [我] as *“I”* [吾], with *“great”* [大] followed by *“seem”* [似]. **Fàn** [范] states: *“‘I am great’* [吾大], **Fù Yì** [傅奕] and the *Xījìn* [西晉] ancient manuscript align with the old text.” The *Nǎi* [柰] manuscript includes *“seem to tilt”* [似傾] after *“great”* [大], with *“tilt”* [傾] being a corrupt addition.\n\n**Chéng Xuányīng** [成玄英] explains: The *Héshàng* [河上] version renders *“unworthy”* [肖] as *“laugh”* [笑]. Other versions read *“laugh”* [笑], meaning *“The **Old Master** [老君], embodying the **Dao/Way** naturally, attains perfect fruition—thus the common folk cannot but revere him as the **Great Sage** [大聖]. How could they laugh at him? It is only because, in dealing with others, he remains humble and unassuming, never boasting or scoffing, that they regard him thus.”\n\n「不肖」案成说纡曲难通。 「笑」与「肖」本声韵相同。\n\n于省吾《荀子新证》引《非相》篇：「今夫狌狌形肖，亦二足而毛也。」谓「形笑」即「形肖」，则知此「不笑」亦即「不肖」耳。\n\n然碑本作「肖」乃本字，作「笑」者通假；若罗卷「笑」作「○」，则俗字耳。作「肖」，乃老子书中用楚方言。扬雄《方言》七：「肖、类，法也。齐曰类，西楚、梁、益之间曰肖。……西南、梁、益之间凡言相类者，亦谓之肖。」郭璞注：「肖者似也。」《小尔雅·广训》：「不肖，不似也。」譣谊，「不肖」上不应再有「似」字。夫唯大，故不肖；若肖，久矣其细！\n\n严可均曰：「其细」，御注、王弼作「其细也夫」，高翿作「其○也夫」，河上「其细」绝，以「夫」字属下句。罗振玉曰：「夫唯大，故似」，景龙本、敦煌本均无「似」字。「不肖」，敦煌辛本作「故不笑」。「其细也夫」，景龙本无「也夫」二字，景福本无「也」字，敦煌壬本无「夫」字，辛本作「若笑救其小」，殆有误字。武内义雄曰：敦、遂二本「细」作「小」。\n\n我有三宝，持而宝之：\n一曰慈，二曰俭，三曰不敢为天下先；\n夫慈，故能勇；\n俭，故能广；\n不敢为天下先，故能成器长。\n\n劳健曰：「宝」、「保」二字，古文近同，互通。二「宝」字为韵，「宝」字宜在下。」《广雅·释诂》：「宝，道也。」《檀弓》：「丧人无宝，仁亲以为宝」，郑注：「宝谓善道可守者。」六十二章「道者……善人之宝」，是老子以宝为道。《六十九章》：「轻敌几丧吾宝」，谓几丧吾道也。此言我有三道，持而宝之也。\n\n纪昀曰：「器」，韩非子作「事」。俞樾曰：韩子《解老》篇作「不敢为天下先，故能为成事长」。「事」「器」异文，或相传之本异，或彼涉上文「事无不事」句而误，皆不可知。至「故能」下有「为」字，则当从之，盖「成器」二字相连为文。《襄十四年左传》：「成国不过半天子之军」，杜注曰：「成国，大国。」\n\nThe *Zhāowǔ* (昭五年) *Annals* states: \"All are *chéng* counties,\" where *chéng* counties refer to great counties. Thus, *\"chéngqì\"* (成器) means a great vessel.\n\nIn Chapter Twenty-Nine: *\"The heavenly *shénqì* (神器) cannot be wielded,\"* the *Ěryá* (尔雅) explains: *\"Shén* (神) means weighty.\"* Thus, *\"shénqì\"* is a weighty vessel, while *\"chéngqì\"* is a great vessel. Both terms speak of the realm of the world—simply put, it is only because one does not dare to lead the world that one can become its leader.\n\nLiu Shīpèi (刘师培) notes: The ancient texts have *\"wéichéngqìzhǎng\"* (为成器长) with the *\"wéi\"* (为) preserved. *\"Chéngqìzhǎng\"* (成器长) refers to a great official; *\"wéi\"* (为) means \"to reside.\" In antiquity, *\"gōng\"* (工) and *\"guān\"* (官) were interchangeable, so a great official was also called *\"chéngqìzhǎng.\"* The current text omits *\"wéi\"* (为), making it ungrammatical.\n\nYang Chūn (杨椿) says: The *Kūn* (坤) hexagram of the *Yì* (易) states: *\"Kūn, though supremely yielding, yet in action is strong.\"* Thus, the saying *\"obtain virtue and have courage\"* (得乎仁者有勇之说) arises, hence: *\"Palatial, thus able to be courageous.\"* The *Jiè* (节) hexagram states: *\"Moderation in institutions—no waste of resources, no harm to the people.\"* Thus, the saying *\"frugality suffices\"* (俭以足用之说) arises, hence: *\"Frugal, thus able to be broad.\"* The *Qiān* (谦) hexagram states: *\"Modest and yet illustrious, lowly yet uncrossable.\"* Thus, the saying *\"one virtue yields four benefits\"* (一谦而四益具之说) arises, hence: *\"Not daring to lead the world, thus able to become its great leader.\"* The *Yì* and the *Lǎozǐ* align like matching seals.\n\nIf one abandons *cí* (慈) for *yǒng* (勇), *jiǎn* (俭) for *guǎng* (广), and *hòu* (后) for *xiān* (先), then one is doomed.\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: In the *Yìzhù* (御注) and *Gāoxì* (高翿) versions, *\"shě\"* (舍) is followed by *\"qí\"* (其) in all three sentences. *\"Qiéxiān\"* (且先) is mistakenly reversed in the *Yìzhù*. Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Yìzhù* version and the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) text all have *\"qí\"* (其) after *\"shě\"* (舍). The *Yìzhù* version reverses *\"qiéxiān\"* (且先). According to Jiānzhī (谦之), the *Yán Zhūn* (严遵) text and the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) text both render the first *\"shě\"* (舍) as *\"shì\"* (释). The *Guǎngyáng* (广阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), *Zhào* (赵), *Gāoxì* (高翿), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), and *Héshàng* (河上) versions all use *\"shě\"* (舍), while the *Wáng Bì* (王弼) and *Fàn Yìngyuán* (范应元) versions also use *\"shě\"* (舍). *\"Sǐyǐ\"* (死矣), in the *Yán Zhūn* (严) text, is *\"zé sǐyǐ\"* (则死矣); in the *Yìzhù*, it is *\"qiě sǐyǐ\"* (且死矣); in the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions, it is *\"shì wèi rù sǐmén\"* (是谓入死门).\n\nPalatiality: in war, it conquers; in defense, it holds firm. When Heaven is about to save it, it does so with palatiality as its shield.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes: The *Wáng* (王) text uses *\"zhàn\"* (战), matching the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yìzhù* (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions. The *Shìwén* (释文) omits *\"yǐ chén\"* (以陈), indicating the *Wáng* (王) text originally had *\"chén\"* (陈). The *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions also use *\"chén\"* (陈). *\"Tiān jiāng jiù zhī\"* (天将救之), in the *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions, has *\"yǐ shàn\"* (以善) after *\"zhī\"* (之). Wǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) states: The *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) versions read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则政). Jiānzhī (谦之) notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) text reads *\"yǐ chén zé zhǐ\"* (以陈则止), where *\"zhǐ\"* (止) is a mistake for *\"zhèng\"* (正). The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则正). Bì Yàn (毕沅) says: *\"Héshànggōng* (河上公) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) render it *\"cí yǐ zhàn zé shèng\"* (慈以战则胜), while *Hán Fēi* (韩非) renders it *\"cí yú zhàn zé shèng\"* (慈于战则胜). By meaning, it should be *\"chén\"* (陈). Additionally, in *Wáng Bì*’s (王弼) annotation: *\"Palatial in battle, thus victorious; in defense, thus steadfast—hence able to be courageous.\"* And again: *\"Confronting danger without retreat, thus victorious.\"* The *\"shèng\"* (胜) in the *Dàozàng Wáng* (道藏王) text is *\"zhèng\"* (正), proving the original *Wáng* (王) text also read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则正).\n\n**Phonology:** Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme reading for this chapter: *yǒng* (勇), *guǎng* (广), *zhǎng* (长) (under *yáng* and *dōng* rhyme groups, with *yǒng* in *wǎng* sound). *Yǒng* (勇) belongs to the *dōng* department, while *guǎng* (广) and *zhǎng* (长) belong to the *yáng* department, thus *yáng* and *dōng* are harmonized. Xī Dòng (奚侗) agrees. Yáo Wéntián (姚文田) and Dèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) classify *guǎng* (广) and *zhǎng* (长) under the same rhyme. *\"Jiǔyǐ qí xì\"* (久矣其细), in the *Yán* (严) text, has *\"xiǎo\"* (小), with *xiào* (肖), *xiào* (肖), *xiào* (肖), *xiǎo* (小) rhyming. Wú Chē (吴棫) supplements the *Sānlìùshíliùyǎng* (三十六养): *\"Yǒng\"* (勇), pronounced *yùliǎng* (羽两切), meaning \"vigorous.\"\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* states:\n*\"Palatial, thus able to be courageous;\nFrugal, thus able to be broad;\nNot daring to lead the world, thus able to become its great leader.\"*\n\n*Zhǎng* (长) is pronounced in the *shǎngshēng* (上声).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains 95 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version 97, the *Héshàng* (河上) version matches the *Jǐnglóng*, the *Wáng* (王) version has 99, the *Fù* (傅) version 105, and the *Fàn* (范) version 106. The *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *\"Sānbǎo Dìliùshíqī\"* (三宝第六十七), the *Wáng* (王) version *\"Liùshíqījiē\"* (六十七章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *\"Tiānxiàjiējué Dìliùshíqī\"* (天下皆谓章第六十七).\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight:**\n*\"The ancients who were skilled in being a gentleman did not rely on force.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: The phrase *\"gǔ zhī shàn wéi shì zhě\"* (古之善为士者) is absent in all versions. Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions both have *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之) at the sentence’s beginning. Wǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) says: The *Dūn* (敦), *Suì* (遂), and *Jǐng* (景) versions all have *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之) at the start, as does the *Wáng Bì* (王弼) version. Jiānzhī (谦之) notes: All *Wáng* (王) versions lack *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之), except the *Mínghé* (明和) edition of *Lǎozǐ Wángzhù* (老子王注), which in its *kǎoyì* (考异) states: *\"The ancient text reads: 'Gǔ zhī shàn wéi shì zhě bù wǔ yě' (古之善为士者不武也).\"* This refers to the *Fù Yì* (傅奕) ancient text. Wǔnèi (武内) erred in his collation. Additionally, the *Gù* (顾) and *Fàn* (范) versions also include *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之).\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rage, the skilled victor over enemies does not vie, and the skilled wielder of **virtue** (rén) acts from the lowest position.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *\"Bù vie\"* (不争), the *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions render as *\"bù yǔ\"* (不与). *\"The skilled wielder of **virtue** (rén) acts from the lowest position\"* (善用仁者为下), all versions have *\"rén\"* (仁) as *\"rén\"* (人), while the *Yùzhù* (御注) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions read *\"wéi zhī xià\"* (为之下).\n\nLuó Zhènyù states: *\"The skilled warrior\"* (善战者), the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) version omits the *\"zhě\"* (者) character, as do the three following sentences. *\"Bù yǔ\"* (不与), in the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yùzhù* (御注), *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions, *\"yǔ\"* (与) is uniformly rendered as *\"zhēng\"* (争), while the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) version retains *\"yǔ\"* (与). *\"The skilled wielder of **virtue** (rén) acts from the lowest position\"* (善用人者为之下), the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) version has *\"rén\"* (仁) instead of *\"rén\"* (人), and lacks the *\"zhī\"* (之) character. The *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions also lack *\"zhī\"* (之).\n\nWǔnèi Yìxióng says: The *Dūn* (敦), *Suì* (遂), and *Jǐng* (景) versions all render *\"yǔ\"* (与) as *\"zhēng\"* (争). According to this, *\"zhēng\"* (争) corresponds with *\"bù zhēng zhī dé\"* (不争之德) below, so it should indeed be *\"zhēng\"* (争).\n\nJiānzhī notes: Xíng Xuán (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Zhào* (赵), and *Gāo* (高) versions all read *\"bù zhēng\"* (不争). The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Gù* (顾), and *Zhào* (赵) versions, as well as the *Héshàng* (河上) version, lack *\"zhī\"* (之). Moreover, the *Pánxī* (磻溪) version renders *\"nù\"* (怒) as *\"shù\"* (恕), and the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) version substitutes *\"zhī\"* (之) with *\"tiān\"* (天), both errors.\n\nLiú Shīpéi states: *Wáng Bì* (王弼) renders *\"bù yǔ zhēng yě\"* (不与争也), but *\"yǔ\"* (与) should be *\"jǔ\"* (举), where *\"jǔ\"* (举) means to raise arms, akin to the abbreviated *\"bīng\"* (兵) in ancient texts like *\"dà jǔ\"* (大举).\n\nTáo Hóngqìng says: *Wáng Bì* (王弼) renders *\"bù yǔ zhēng\"* (不与争), yet only states *\"bù yǔ\"* (不与), omitting the crucial word entirely. *\"Yǔ\"* (与) is the same as *\"zhēng\"* (争). In the *Mòzǐ Fēi Rú Xià Piān* (墨子非儒下篇), it says: *\"If all were **virtuous** (rén) people, then they would vie without words\"* (若皆仁人也，则无说而相与), which aligns with the later *\"If they clash like torrents\"* (若雨暴交争) in meaning—here *\"xiāng yǔ\"* (相与) is the same as *\"xiāng zhēng\"* (相争). *Wáng Shì* (王氏) cites the *Jīngyì Shùwén* (经义述闻) to say: *\"In ancient times, 'correspond' (dāng) and 'oppose' (dí), were both called 'yǔ' (与).\"* The annotation and verification are most thorough. *\"Dāng\"* (当) and *\"dí\"* (敌) both share meaning with *\"zhēng\"* (争). It is likely the original annotation read *\"yǔ zhēng yě\"* (与争也). Later generations, failing to grasp its meaning, presumptuously added the *\"bù\"* (不) character.\n\nJiānzhī notes: Táo’s (陶) explanation is correct. The *Jīngyì Shùwén* (经义述闻) cites the *Hànshū Gāodì Jì* (汉书高帝纪): *\"I know how to oppose him\"* (吾知与之矣), where *\"yǔ\"* (与) means the same as *\"dí\"* (敌). Again, the *Shǐjì Yàn Shìjiā* (史记燕世家) says: *\"Páng Nuǎn is easy to oppose\"* (庞暖易与耳). The *Báiqǔ Jiàn* (白起传) says: *\"Lián Pó is easy to oppose\"* (廉颇易与). The *Huái'Yīn Hóu Zhuàn* (淮阴侯传) says: *\"I have always known that Hàn Xīn is easy to oppose\"* (吾生平知韩信为人易与耳). In ancient times, *\"yǔ\"* (与) meant to face an enemy. In the *Zuǒzhuàn Xiānggōng Èrshíwǔ Nián* (左传襄公二十五年), it says: *\"One against one, who could oppose me?\"* (一与一，谁能惧我？) Here, *\"yǔ\"* (与) is the same as *\"zhēng\"* (争). Láo Jiàn (劳健) and Gāo Hēng (高亨) also cite similar evidence. The current *Dàozàng Héshàng* (道藏河上) version reads *\"bù yǔ zhēng\"* (不与争), which carries greater meaning. *\"Yǔ\"* (与) rhymes with *\"wǔ\"* (武), *\"nù\"* (怒), and *\"xià\"* (下), whereas *\"zhēng\"* (争) does not. This is called the **virtue** (virtue) of non-vying, hence the power of employing people, and this is termed the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī).\n\nLuó Zhènyù states: The *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚), and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions all have *\"jī\"* (极) followed by *\"yě\"* (也).\n\nWǔnèi Yìxióng says: *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天古之极), the *\"gǔ\"* (古) character is a redundant addition; Yú Yè (俞樾) in *Lǎozǐ Píngyì* (老子平议) has provided evidence for this.\n\nJiānzhī notes: The first sentence *\"This is called\"* (是谓), *Gù* (顾) renders as *\"This is why\"* (是以). The second sentence *\"This is why\"* (是以), the *Yán* (严) version lacks it entirely, while all other versions render it as *\"This is called\"* (是谓). Additionally, *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Nǎi Juàn* (柰卷), and *Gù* (顾) versions all have *\"jī\"* (极) followed by *\"yě\"* (也). Yú Yè (俞樾) says: Each sentence in this chapter carries a rhyme. The first four sentences rhyme with *\"wǔ\"* (武), *\"nù\"* (怒), *\"yǔ\"* (与), and *\"xià\"* (下); the last three rhyme with *\"dé\"* (德), *\"lì\"* (力), and *\"jī\"* (极). If *\"This is called the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (是谓配天) is taken as a sentence, it lacks rhyme, so *\"gǔ\"* (古) is likely a redundant addition. *\"This is called the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (是谓配天之极) as a six-character sentence aligns with the structure of *\"This is called the **virtue** (virtue) of non-vying\"* (是谓不争之德) and *\"This is called the power of employing people\"* (是谓用人之力). The redundant *\"gǔ\"* (古) character, being synonymous with *\"tiān\"* (天), is an error. The *Zhōushū Zhōu Zhù Piān* (周书周祝篇) says: *\"**Heaven** (Tiān) is the ancient\"* (天为古). The *Shàngshū Yáo Diǎn* (尚书尧典) says *\"If one examines the ancient **Heaven** (Tiān) of Emperor Yáo\"* (若稽古帝尧), and the *Zhèng Zhù* (郑注) states: *\"Ancient, meaning **Heaven** (Tiān).\"* Thus *\"gǔ\"* (古) and *\"tiān\"* (天) share the same meaning. In this **sutra** (sutra), *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天之极) may appear in other versions as *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching the ancient in ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配古之极), but later scribes mistakenly merged them. Jiānzhī notes: Yú’s (俞) explanation also appears in *Gǔshū Yíyì Lì* (古书疑义举例五) under *\"Two characters with the same meaning and redundant addition,\"* and his reasoning is sound. The *Ěryǎ Shìgǔ* (尔雅释诂) defines *\"jī\"* (极) as *\"reaching its utmost\"* (至也). The *Shījìng Sōnggāo* (诗嵩高) says *\"Swiftly reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (骏极于天), and the *Zhuàn* (传) explains: *\"Reaching its utmost\"* (至也). The *Lǐjì Lèjì* (礼记乐记) says *\"Reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān) and curling around the earth\"* (极乎天而蟠于地), and the *Zhù* (注) states: *\"Reaching its utmost\"* (至也). *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天之极) shares a similar meaning with *\"Swiftly reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (骏极于天) and *\"Reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (极乎天). *\"Pèi\"* (配) means *\"to harmonize\"* (合也). In the *Zhuāngzǐ Tiāndì Piān* (庄子天地篇), it says: *\"Emperor Yáo asked Xǔyóu: 'Can **Nǐèmiè** (啮缺) harmonize with **Heaven** (Tiān)?’\"* (尧问于许由曰：「啮缺可以配天乎？」）, and the *Chéngshū* (成疏) explains: *\"Harmonize, meaning to match. Emperor Yáo said that **Nǐèmiè** (啮缺) was a **virtuous** (virtue) man capable of harmonizing with **Heaven** (Tiān)'s position.\"* In the *Xúnzǐ Dàluè Piān* (荀子大略篇), it says: *\"When the **Son of Heaven** (Tiānzǐ) ascends the throne... the middle minister approaches and says: 'He who harmonizes with **Heaven** (Tiān) and possesses the **lower lands** (xiàtǔ) must first address affairs and then manage them, first anticipate troubles and then resolve them.’\"* (天子即位……中卿进曰：「配天而有下土者，先事处事，先患虑患。」) The phrase *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天之极) thus refers to the **Dao** (Way) of harmonizing with **Heaven** (Tiān) to its utmost.\n\n「古」字疑属下章，错入于此。\nThe character **\"Gǔ\"** (古) likely belongs to the next chapter and has been mistakenly inserted here.\n\n「古用兵有言」，与二十二章「古之所谓曲则全者」，同为执古之道以语今之有。\n*\"In ancient warfare, there were sayings\"* (古用兵有言) aligns with the Twenty-Second Chapter’s *\"The ancient principle of ‘what seems crooked is actually complete’*\"* (古之所谓曲则全者), both invoking the **Dao** (Way) of antiquity to speak to the present.\n\n于省吾谓：「『配天』二字，应有重文，本作『是谓配＝天＝古之极』。\nYú Shěngwú suggests that the phrase **\"Pèi Tiān\"** (配天) should have a repeated character, originally written as *\"This is called **Pèi** (配) **Tiān** (天) **Gǔ zhī jī** (古之极).\"*\n\n读作「是谓配天」句，「配天古之极」韵。\nIt should be read as two separate sentences: *\"This is called **Pèi Tiān** (配天)\"* and *\"The **Dao** (Way) of **Pèi Tiān** (配天) in ultimate **extreme** (jī).\"* [Note: Here, \"韵\" (yùn) is translated as \"rhythm\" for poetic structure.]\n\n【音韵】此章江氏韵读：武、怒、与、下韵（鱼部，怒，上声），德、力、极韵（之部）。\n**[Rhythm/Phonology]** According to Jiāng Shì’s readings, this chapter follows the rhyme scheme: *Wǔ* (武), *Nù* (怒), *Yǔ* (与), *Xià* (下) [Fish Department, Anger, Upper Tone], and *Dé* (德), *Lì* (力), *Jī* (极) [Zhi Department].\n\n诸家并同。\nAll other scholars concur.\n\n武内义雄「与」作「争」，谓「此『争』字与下『不争之德』相对，作『争』是」。\nWǔnèi Yìxióng renders *\"Yǔ\"* (与) as *\"Zhēng\"* (争), arguing that *\"this **‘Zhēng’** (争) character contrasts with the later **‘non-contending virtue’** (不争之德), making **‘Zhēng’** (争) the correct reading.\"*\n\n故惟武、怒、下韵，「争」字无韵。\nThus, only *Wǔ* (武), *Nù* (怒), and *Xià* (下) rhyme, leaving *\"Zhēng\"* (争) without a rhyme.\n\n---\n\n六十九章 用兵有言：「吾不敢为主而为客，不敢进寸而退尺。」\nChapter Sixty-Nine states in warfare: *\"I dare not act as the host but instead as the guest, nor advance an inch and retreat a foot.\"*\n\n罗振玉曰：「敢」字，敦煌壬本作「能」。\nLuó Zhěnyù suggests that *\"**Gǎn**\"* (敢) in the **Dunhuang manuscript** (敦煌本) is rendered as *\"**Néng**\"* (能).\n\n谦之案：范本「兵」下有「者」字，傅、范本「言」下有「曰」字，遂州本「敢」下有「求」字。\n*Qiánzhī* notes: In Fàn’s text, there is an added *\"**zhě**\"* (者) after *\"**bīng**\"* (兵);

However, it reads *\"**‘kàng bīng xiāng rú’**\"* (抗兵相如), where *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如) is the correct character, and *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) likely arose from a shape-based error with *\"**‘rú’**\"*. Láo Jiàn (劳健) notes that the *Dūnhuáng* Tang-era copy reads *\"**‘kàng bīng xiāng rú’**\"*.\n\nThe *Fàn* (范), *Xiàoshàng* (河上), and *Zhū Wáng* (诸王) manuscripts all incorrectly render it as *\"**‘xiāng jiā’**\"* (相加). Wáng Bì’s (王弼) annotation states: *\"**‘Kàng’**\"* (抗) means **‘to confront or raise’** (举), and *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) means **‘to meet or clash’** (当). Referring to the *Zhàn Guó Cé* (战国策): *\"**‘Fú Sòng zhī bù rú Liáng yě’**\"* (夫宋之不如梁也), Gāo Zhù (高注) explains: *\"**‘Rú’**\"* (如) means **‘to meet or clash’** (当). This confirms that *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) in Wáng’s (王) annotation is a shape-based error for *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如). The *Lǐjì Zhēngzǐ Wèn* (礼记曾子问) states: *\"**‘Rú jué biàn ér yòng bù’**\"* (如爵弁而用布) and *\"**‘rú yǒu xiōngdì’**\"* (如有兄弟), with the *Shìwén* (释文) noting that *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如) was originally *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加). Thus, these two characters have long been subject to mutual scribal errors.\n\nThe origin of the erroneous *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) lies in its being mistaken for *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如). Today’s annotators mostly follow the erroneous text, interpreting it as *\"**‘clashing armies’**\"*, thereby missing its true intent.\n\nYú Yì (俞樾) argues: *\"**‘Āi’**\"* (哀) lacks meaning and is likely a miswriting for *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄). The *Shǐjì* (史记) states: *\"Liáng Huì zú, Xiāng Wáng lì, Xiāng Wáng zú, Āi Wáng lì\"* (梁惠卒，襄王立，襄王卒，哀王立). According to the *Zhúshū Jìnián* (竹书纪年), there was no *\"**‘Āi Wáng’**\"* (哀王), and Gù Shì’s (顾氏) *Rì Zhī Lù* (日知录) notes that *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) and *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) are visually similar, with the *Shǐjì* mistakenly splitting them into two individuals. Additionally, the *Qín Āi Gōng* (秦哀公) and *Chén Āi Gōng* (陈哀公) in the *Shǐjì*’s *\"Shíèr Zhūhòu Niánbiǎo\"* (十二诸侯年表) are all recorded as *\"**‘Xiāng Gōng’**\"* (襄公), proving that these two characters have long been confused. *\"**‘Xiāng’**\"* (襄) is a substitute for *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让). The *Zhōu Guān Bǎoshì Zhí* (周官保氏职) *Zhèng Shū* (郑注) on *\"**‘xiāng chǐ’**\"* (襄尺) has the *Shìwén* (释文) stating: *\"**‘Xiāng yīn ràng, běnzuò ràng’**\"* (襄音让，本作让), meaning *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) and *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让) were interchangeable in antiquity. The earlier passage states: *\"**‘Wú bù gǎn wéi zhǔ ér wéi kè, wú bù gǎn jìn cùn ér tuì chǐ’**\"* (吾不敢为主而为客，吾不敢进寸而退尺), which embodies *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让). Thus, it is said: *\"**‘Kàng bīng xiāng jiā, ràng zhě shèng yǐ’**\"* (抗兵相加，让者胜矣). The character *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) was used as a substitute for *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让), then mistakenly written as *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀), causing scholars to lose the correct interpretation.\n\nYú’s (俞) explanation is convoluted, and though Wǔnèi Yìyǒng (武内义雄) follows it, it alters the text to interpret the scripture. Yì Shùndìng (易顺鼎) argues: *\"**‘Āi’**\"* (哀) is the same as *\"**‘ài’**\"* (爱), as ancient characters were interchangeable. The *\"Shī Xù\"* (诗序) states: *\"**‘Āi yǎotiǎo ér bù yín qí sè’**\"* (哀窈窕而不淫其色), where *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) should be read as *\"**‘ài’**\"* (爱). Thus, *\"**‘Kàng bīng xiāng jiā, āi zhě shèng’**\"* (抗兵相加，哀者胜) aligns with the earlier chapter’s *\"**‘cí, yǐ zhàn zé shèng yě’**\"* (慈，以战则胜也).\n\nJiǎng Xīchāng (蒋锡昌) states: The *\"Shuōwén Jiězì\"* (说文解字) defines *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) as *\"**‘mǐn’**\"* (闵), which corresponds to *\"**‘cí’**\"* (慈) in Chapter 67. This passage speaks of two sides confronting each other in battle, with the result that the compassionate side will prevail—just as Chapter 67 states: *\"**‘Cí, yǐ zhàn zé shèng’**\"* (慈，以战则胜). Both interpretations are plausible.\n\nFurther evidence comes from Chapter 31: *\"**‘Shā rén duō, yǐ bēi’āi lì zhī, zhàn shèng, yǐ āi lǐ chǔ zhī’**\"* (杀人多，以悲哀莅之，战胜，以哀礼处之), all of which are precise ancient military teachings. Thus, the character *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) is not erroneous.\n\n---\n**[Phonology]**\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme reading for this chapter follows the *\"Kè, chǐ\"* (客、尺) rhyme (Yú department, *chǐ* and *chǔ* as entering tones), *\"xíng, bīng\"* (行、兵) rhyme (Yáng department), and *\"bì, dí\"* (臂、敌) rhyme (Zhī department). He rearranges the *\"**‘zhí wú bīng’**\"* (执无兵) clause above *\"**‘réng wú dí’**\"* (仍无敌). This is correct.\n\nHowever, the *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) manuscripts read *\"**‘zhí wú bīng, réng wú dí’**\"* (执无兵，仍无敌), as does the *Yán* (严) manuscript. Here, *\"**‘xíng, bīng, bì, dí’**\"* (行、兵、臂、敌) alternate as rhymes. Jiāng’s (江) rearrangement—*\"**‘xíng wú xíng, zhí wú bīng, rǎng wú bì, rēng wú dí’**\"* (行无行，执无兵，攘无臂，扔无敌)—though closer, still fails to capture the alternating rhyme’s elegance. Yáo Wéntián (姚文田), adhering to the original, takes *\"**‘xíng, bīng’**\"* (行、兵) as rhyming and argues that *\"**‘bì, dí’**\"* (臂、敌) naturally harmonize, which is still inferior to Jiāng’s (江) approach.\n\nAdditionally, *\"**‘xíng’**\"* (行) is pronounced *\"**‘háng’**\"* (杭) in the lower clause. Dèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) notes that *\"**‘kè, chǐ’**\"* (客、尺) form a rhyme in the *Yú* and *Yú* departments as entering tones. *\"**‘Kè’**\"* (客), with the *\"gè\"* (各) tone, belonged to the ancient *Yù* department, rhyming with *\"**‘mò, shù, dù, cuò’**\"* (莫、庶、度、错) in the *\"Chǔ Cí\"* (楚茨). *\"**‘Chǐ’**\"* (尺), in ancient pronunciation, also belonged to the *Yù* department, rhyming with *\"**‘bó, dù’**\"* (柏、度) in the *\"Mǐn Gōng\"* (閟宫). Jiāng Yǒuguì (江有诰) in *\"Táng Yùn Sìshēng Zhèng Èrshísān Xí\"* (唐韵四声正二十四锡) states: *\"**‘Dí’**\"* (敌) is pronounced *\"**‘tú lì qiè’**\"* (徒历切). According to ancient usage, it had a departing tone, aligning with the *Zhì* department. In *Lǎozǐ Xuányòng Piān* (老子玄用篇), *\"**‘réng’**\"* (仍) rhymes with *\"**‘dí’**\"* (敌) and *\"**‘bì’**\"* (臂).\n\nThe *Yòujīnglóng Bēi* (右景龙碑本) contains 54 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) manuscript 55, the *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng* (王) manuscripts 54, the *Fù* (傅) manuscript 57, and the *Fàn* (范) manuscript 58. The *Héshàng* (河上) manuscript is titled *\"Xuányòng dì liùshíjiǔ\"* (玄用第六十九), the *Wáng* (王) manuscript *\"Liùshíjiǔ\"* (六十九章), and the *Fàn* (范) manuscript *\"Yòngbīng zhě yǒu yán zhāng dì liùshíjiǔ\"* (用兵者有言章第六十九).\n\n---\n**Chapter 70**\n*\"Wú yán shèn yì zhī, shèn yì xíng.\"* (吾言甚易知，甚易行)\n\n**Chapter 70 (continued)**\n\nThough none in the world can know it,\nNone can practice it.\n\n*Case of Qián Zhī*: The first two lines, in the *Yán* manuscript, have the character *\"ér\"* (而) before *\"tiān\"* (天). The *Fù* and *Fàn* manuscripts read: *\"Ér rén mó zhī néng zhī, mó zhī néng xíng\"* (而人莫之能知，莫之能行).\n\nWords have their origin,\nAffairs have their master.\n\n*Case of Qián Zhī*: The *Huáinán Dào Yīng Piān* (淮南道应训) cites these two lines identically. The *Wénzǐ Jīngchéng Piān* (文子精诚篇) reads *\"shì yǒu běn\"* (事有本), while the *Wéimíng Piān* (微明篇) reads *\"shì yǒu zhǔ\"* (事有君). The citations diverge. In the *Fù* and *Fàn* manuscripts, *\"zhǔ\"* (君) is written as *\"zhǔ\"* (主). *Fàn* notes: *\"The character ‘主’ follows the ancient manuscripts.\"*\n\nOnly those without knowledge fail to recognize me.\n*Luó Zhènyù* notes: The *Dūnhuáng* manuscript reads *\"wú\"* (吾) instead of *\"wǒ\"* (我).\n*Case of Qián Zhī*: The *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Yán*, *Péng*, and *Huáinán Dào Yīng Piān* all read *\"wú\"* (吾). The *Yán* manuscript reads *\"Wéiwú wǒ zhī\"* (唯无我知). The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) manuscript reads *\"bù\"* (不) as *\"mò\"* (莫). The *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Péng*, and *Zhào* manuscripts, as well as the *Zhìyào* (治要) citation, add *\"yě\"* (也) after the second *\"zhī\"* (知).

Both *Fù* and *Fàn* manuscripts insert *\"ér\"* (而) after *\"huà\"* (褐), as does the *Dūnhuáng Rén* manuscript.\n*Case*: *\"Huà\"* (褐) is the Chu dialect used in *Lǎozǐ*. The *Huáinánzǐ Qísú Xuàn Zhù* (淮南子齐俗训注) states: *\"Chǔrén wèi páo wéi duǎn huà dà yī\"* (楚人谓袍为短褐大衣). *\"Huà\"* (褐) also refers to coarse clothing or short garments. *Sòng Miànchū Shìfú* (宋绵初释服) explains: *\"Shī ‘wú yī wú huà’\"* (诗\"无衣无褐\"), *\"huà\"* (褐) is *\"máo bù\"* (毛布). *\"Mèngzǐ ‘Xǔzǐ yī huà’\"* (孟子\"许子衣褐\"), *\"huà\"* (褐) is *\"yǐ cuì zhī\"* (以毳织之), *\"ruò jīn mǎ yī yě\"* (若今马衣也). Some say *\"huà\"* (褐) is *\"biān jī yī\"* (编枲衣), or *\"cū yī\"* (粗衣). The *Jíjiù Biān Zhù* (急就编注) states: *\"Huà máo wéi yī, huò yuē cū yī yě\"* (褐毛为衣，或曰粗衣也). Another meaning is *\"cū bù yī\"* (粗布衣). The *Shuōwén* (说文) states: *\"Huà, biān jī\"* (褐，编枲). *Rén Dàchūn Shēn yī Shìlì sān* (任大椿深衣释例三) cites: *\"Yànzǐ Jiànshàng Piān\"* (晏子谏上篇): *\"Bǎixìng lǎoruò dòng hán, bùdé duǎn huà\"* (百姓老弱冻寒，不得短褐). The *Mòzǐ Gōngchū Piān* (墨子公输篇) and *Zhànguó Céngshì Sòng Cè* (战国策宋策) both state: *\"Shě qí wénxiù, lín yǒu duǎn huà ér yù qiè zhī\"* (舍其文绣，邻有短褐而欲窃之). The *Xúnzǐ Dàluè Piān* (荀子大略篇) states: *\"Yī zé shù huà bù wán\"* (衣则竖褐不完), with the commentary *\"shù huà, tóngshuāng zhī huà\"* (竖褐，童竖之褐), also referring to *\"duǎn huà\"* (短褐). The *Huáinánzǐ Qísú Xuàn* (淮南子齐俗训) states: *\"Bì yǒu jiān qì jī chì duǎn huà bù wán zhě\"* (必有菅蹻跐踦短褐不完者). The *Lǎnmíng Xuàn* (览冥训) states: *\"Shuāngxuě jí jí, duǎn huà bù wán\"* (霜雪亟集，短褐不完). The *Xīn Xiù* (新序) states: *\"Wúyán ná bì duǎn huà, zì qǐng Xuān Wáng\"* (无盐乃拂短褐，自请宣王). The *Shǐjì Qín Shǐhuáng Jì* (史记秦始皇纪) states: *\"Fú hàn zhě lì duǎn huà\"* (夫寒者利短褐). The *Suǒyǐn* (索隐) explains: *\"Yuē huàbù, shù cái wéi láo yì zhī yī, duǎn ér xiá, suǒ wèi duǎn huà, yì yuē shù huà\"* (谓褐布，竖裁为劳役之衣，短而且狭，故谓之短褐，亦曰竖褐). Whenever *\"huà\"* (褐) is mentioned, it is always *\"duǎn huà\"* (短褐).\n\n*Case*: The *Kǒngzǐ Jiāyǔ Sānshù Piān* (孔子家语三恕篇) states: *\"Zǐlù wèn yú Kǒngzǐ yuē: ‘Yǒurén yú cǐ, bèi huà huái yù, hé rú?’\"* (子路问于孔子曰：\"有人于此，被褐而怀玉，何如？\") *\"Kǒngzǐ yuē: ‘Guó wú dào, yǐn zhī kě yě; guó yǒu dào, zé póu miǎn ér zhí yù.’\"* (孔子曰：\"国无道，隐之可也；国有道，则裒冕而执玉。\") The language also originates here.\n\n**[Phonology]** *Jiāng Shì*’s tonal reading of this chapter contains no rhyme.\n\n「Gao Benhan: *xi*, *gui* rhyme.

The phrase *“Only because of sickness, sickness”* (夫唯病病) is repeated, followed by *“thus he does not fall into sickness”* (是以不病), and *“The Sage’s not falling into sickness”* (圣人之不病) is also repeated. The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions are even more verbose—clearly not the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text.\n\nQian Daxun states:\n*“‘Only because of sickness, sickness, thus he does not fall into sickness; The Sage’s not falling into sickness, because he treats sickness as sickness, thus he does not fall into sickness’*—the stone text merely reads ‘*Thus the Sage does not fall into sickness, because he treats sickness as sickness, thus he does not fall into sickness.*’\nThis type is far superior to other versions.”*\nThis is indeed so.\n\nThe **phonology and rhyme** of this chapter: Jiang Shiyou’s readings lack rhyme, as does Yao Wenti’s. Gao Benhan notes the rhyme of *shàng* (上) and *bìng* (病). Xí Dòng renders *shàng* (上) as *shàng* (尚). Chen Zhu notes that all six *bìng* (病) characters rhyme. Gu Yanwu’s *Tangyun Zheng* (唐韵正, Vol. 43, *Ying* 映): *“Bìng”* (病) in ancient times had the *ping* (平) tone, *yang* (阳) rhyme, citing this chapter from *Lǎozǐ*. Jiang Yougui’s *Sìshēng Zhèng* (四声正, Vol. 41, *Yàng* 漾): *“Shàng”* (上) is pronounced *shí liàng* (时亮) or *shí yǔ* (时雨). According to ancient usage, *shàng* (上) had a *ping* (平) tone and should be grouped with the *yang* (阳) rhyme. This character appears only in the *Zhōu Shū* (周书) proverb *“Mín wù qí shàng”* (民恶其上, “The people detest their ruler”), where it rhymes with *“wǎng”* (网, “net”) in the *shàngshēng* (上声) tone. In *Lǎozǐ*’s *“Xuányòng Piān”* (玄用篇—*Jiànzhī’àn* [谦之案]: likely a misattribution to *“Zhībìng Piān”* [知病篇]), *“zhī bùzhī shàng”* (知不知上) rhymes with *bìng* (病) in the *qùshēng* (去声) tone; no other instances read *shàng* (上) or *bìng* (病) in *shàngshēng* or *qùshēng*.\n\nThe **Jìnglóng Shìbēn** (景龙碑本) and **Dūnhuáng Běn** (敦煌本) contain **22 characters**; the **Héshàng Běn** (河上本) and **Wáng Běn** (王本) contain **28 characters**; the **Fù Běn** (傅本) and **Fàn Běn** (范本) contain **32 characters**. The **Héshàng Běn** titles this *“Zhībìng Dìqīshíyī”* (知病第七十一), the **Wáng Běn** *“Dìqīshíyī Zhāng”* (七十一章), and the **Fàn Běn** *“Zhībùzhī Zhāng Dìqīshíyī”* (知不知章七十一).\n\n---\n**Chapter 72:** *Mín bù wèi wēi, dà wēi zhì.*\n(Yán Kějūn notes: The *Yùzhù* (御注), **Wáng Bì** (王弼), and **Gāo Yì** (高翿) insert *“zé”* (则) before *“dà wēi zhì”* (大威至). The **Héshàng Běn** omits *“zé”* but adds *“yǐ”* (矣) at the end. **Wèi Jiàosūn** (魏稼孙) states that the *Yùzhù* reads *“rén”* (人) instead of *“mín”* (民). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes that the **Dūnhuáng Gēngběn** (敦煌庚本) reads *“dà wèi zhì yǐ”* (大畏至矣), while the **Rénběn** (壬本) and **Jǐngfú Běn** (景福本) read *“dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (大威至矣). **Takuchi Kaichō** (武内义雄) observes that the **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) manuscripts place *“zé”* (则) at the start of the second clause but omit *“yǐ”* (矣) at the end. **Jiànzhī’àn** (谦之案): The **Guāngmíng Běn** (广明本) reads *“zé dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (则大威至矣), matching **Péng**, **Fù**, and **Fàn** versions. The **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷) reads *“dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (大威至矣), while the **Luó Juàn** (罗卷) reads *“bù wèi wēi, mín bù wèi wēi”* (不畏威，民不畏威). Anciently, *“wèi”* (畏) and *“wēi”* (威) were interchangeable. **Gāo Hēng** (高亨) explains *“zhì”* (至) as *“obstructed”* (碍止): *“If the people do not fear authority, then the ruler’s power is obstructed and cannot prevail”—a warning to those who would wield authority. The next lines *“wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng”* (无狭其所居，无厌其所生) explicitly forbid the use of coercive power.\n\n---\n**Wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng.**\n(Yán Kějūn notes: **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders *“wú xiá”* (无狭) as *“wú xiá”* (无狎). **Luó Zhènyù** states that the **Jìnglóng**, *Yùzhù*, **Jǐngfú**, **Dūnhuáng Gēng**, **Xīn**, and **Rén** manuscripts all read *“xiá”* (狭) instead of *“xiá”* (狎). **Jiànzhī’àn**: **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Guāngmíng**, **Qìngyáng**, **Pánxī**, **Lóuzhèng**, **Nǎi Juàn**, **Héshàng**, **Gāo Yì**, **Yán**, **Gù**, **Péng**, and **Zhào** versions all read *“xiá”* (狭)—(Jiǎng Xíchāng’s annotated **Yán** version reads *“jiá”* (挟), but the **Yílán Táng** edition of **Yán** also reads *“xiá”* (狭)). The **Fù** and **Fàn** versions read *“xiá”* (狎); *“xiá”* (狭) is correct. The **Dàozàng**’s **Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu** (宋张太守) collated **Sìjiā Zhù** (四家注) cites **Wáng Bì**’s annotation: *“Wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng—speaking of how coercive power should not be wielded.”* Again, under *“zì ài bù zì guì”* (自爱不自贵), it cites **Wáng Bì**’s annotation: *“If one esteems oneself, others will feel constrained in their dwellings and livelihoods.”* It is likely that **Wáng Bì**’s original also read *“xiá”* (狭). **Bì Yùn** (毕沅) doubted the existence of *“xiá”* (狭) in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字). **Xí Dòng** states: *“Xiá”* (狭) is the *“shǎn”* (陕) character in the *Shuōwén*—meaning *“narrow”* (隘), with connotations of *“oppression”* (迫). *“Yàn”* (厌) in the *Shuōwén*: *“A basket”* (笮). This passage warns rulers: *“Do not oppress the people’s dwellings, lest they find no comfort; do not exhaust their livelihoods, lest they find no ease.”*\n\n---\n**Fú wéi bù yàn, shìyǐ bù yàn.**\n(**Jiànzhī’àn**: The two *“bù”* (不) characters in the **Fù** and **Fàn** versions are rendered *“wú”* (无). The *“yàn”* (厌) character appears as *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Yùzhù*, **Fàn**, and **Xià Cōng**’s *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn*—the first two *“yàn”* (厌) are incorrect, while the latter is correct. Anciently, *“yàn”* (厌) in *“yàn yù”* (厌饫) and *“yàn zēng”* (厌憎) was written *“yàn”* (厌), while *“yàn”* (厌) in *“pò bī”* (迫逼) was written *“yàn”* (厌)—(see **Dèng Tíngzhēn**’s *Shuāngyàn Zhāi Bǐjì* [双砚斋笔记], Vol. 4). In this chapter, the latter *“yàn”* (厌) is correct, while the first two are both *“yàn”* (厌). In **Chapter 53**, *“yàn yǐnshí”* (厌饮食), and **Chapter 66**, *“shìyǐ tiānxià lè tuī ér bù yàn”* (是以天下乐推而不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is also used. **Wú Chéng**’s version renders the first *“yàn”* (厌) as *“xiá”* (狎), which is incorrect. **Wú** states: *“‘Bù xiá’* (不狎), the old text reads *“bù yàn”* (不厌). **Lúlíng Liú Shì** (庐陵刘氏) says: *“The first *“bù yàn”* (不厌) should be *“bù xiá”* (不狎).”* I follow this. *“Fú wéi bù xiá qí suǒ jū ér wèi suǒ wèi, shìyǐ bù yàn qí suǒ shēng, ér dà kě wèi zhě bù zhì yǐ.”* His reasoning fails to distinguish the two meanings of *“yàn”* (厌), arbitrarily altering the text. The first *“yàn”* (厌) and the latter *“yàn”* (厌), though now homophonous, originally differed in pronunciation and meaning. The first *“yàn”* (厌) means *“to press down”* (压); the latter *“yàn”* (厌) means *“to detest”* (恶). The four-tone evolution of *“yàn”* (厌) is clearly documented—(see **Gù Yánwù**’s *Tangyun Zheng* [唐韵正], Vol. 29, *Yè* 叶). *“Fú wéi bù yàn”* (夫唯不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is *“yì yàn”* (益涉切), an *rùshēng* (入声) tone. *“Shìyǐ bù yàn”* (是以不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is *“yú yàn”* (于艳切), a *qùshēng* (去声) tone. The *Shìwén Jiě* (释文) records *“yàn”* (厌) as *“yú yàn”* (于艳反). Thus, it recognizes only the latter *“yàn”* (厌) but fails to acknowledge the two preceding *“yàn”* (厌) characters, obscuring the *Lǎozǐ*’s original intent.\n\n「The *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *“Yàn*, to **press down** (镇) or **restrain** (笮); composed of 厂 (*yīn* radical) and the phonetic *yàn* (厌).”* Xu Shen remarks: *“**Pen** (笮), to **restrain** (镇) or **press down** (压).”* In the *Zhuózhuàn* (左传) under Duke Zhao’s 26th year: *“He would use it to **restrain** (厌) the people.”* In the *Du Yè Zhìuán* (杜邺传) of the *Hòuhàn Shū* (后汉书): *“**Restrained** (厌) difficulties and **withstood** (折冲) challenges.”* In the *Qián Wǔ Shì* (前五史): *“An earthquake struck Longxi, **destroying** (厌) over four hundred families.”* In the *Dàndiǎn* (檀弓) of the *Lǐjì* (礼记): *“Fear, **disdain** (厌), and drowning.”* In *Xuánzǐ*’s *Qiángguó* (强国): *“Like a wall that **restrains** (厌) [the people].”* Elsewhere, in *Xuánzǐ*’s *Jiěbì* (解蔽): *“One who **presses down** (厌) his eyes to see—sees one thing as two.”* The *Jíyùn* (集韵) sometimes writes it as *“yàn”* (厌) and sometimes as *“yā”* (压). Thus, *“Fú wéi bù yàn”* (夫唯不厌) should be read as *“Fú wéi bù yā”* (夫唯不压)—“**Pressing down** is not done.”\n\nThe latter *“yàn”* (厌), pronounced *“yú yàn”* (于艳切), aligns with the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Lúnyǔ* (论语) *“Xué ér bù yàn”* (学而不厌)—“**learning without disdain**”—as well as the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Dà Sītú* (大司徒) commentary of the *Zhōulǐ* (周礼) *“yǒu yàn”* (有嫌厌)—“**disdainful**”—and the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Huáinán Zǔ* (淮南子) *“Zhǔshù Piān”* (主术篇): *“Thus, the ruler and subjects, though long together, do not **disdain** (厌) each other.”*\nThe meaning here is that the **Dao/Way** of the **sage** (圣人) is one of **virtue/power** (德) without **pressing down** (压) or **restraining** (笮) governance, and thus the people do not **disdain** (恶) it either. Therefore, the **sage** (圣人) **knows himself** (自知) without **self-display** (不自见), **loves himself** (自爱) without **self-exalting** (不自贵). Hence, the text shifts from *“yàn”* (厌) as **press down/restrain** to *“yàn”* (厌) as **disdain**.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes: *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) is written as *“gù”* (故) in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Xīn* (辛) manuscript. **My examination** (谦之案) confirms that the *Shuòzhōu* (遂州) version also uses *“gù”* (故). The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) manuscripts both insert *“ér”* (而) before *“bù”* (不). The phrase *“Qù bǐ qǔ cǐ”* (去彼取此) also appears in **Chapter 13** and **Chapter 38**, as well as in the *Huáinán Zǔ*’s *Dàoyìng Xuàn* (道应训) citation.\n\n**[Phonology]** This chapter lacks rhyme in Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) readings. **Gāo Běn Hàn** (高本汉) classifies it under the *Wēi* (威) and *Zhì* (至) rhymes. **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) assigns it to *Zēngzhī* (增知), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) rhymes. **My examination** (谦之案) aligns with *Yán Kějūn*’s (严可均) *Shuōwén Shēnglèi* (说文声类), which places *“yàn”* (厌) under the *Zhì* (至) and *Wēi* (威) rhymes in the *Zhǐ* (脂) category. *Wáng Niànsūn*’s (王念孙) *Gǔyùn Pǔ* (古韵谱) groups *Wēi* (威), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) under *Zhǐ* (脂), while *Zhì* (至) is merged into *Zhǐ* (脂) and *Zhì* (至) categories. *“Zhī”* (知), an *rùshēng* (入声) word in the *Zhī* (支) category, means that not only *Wēi* (威) and *Zhì* (至) form a rhyme, but *Wēi* (威), *Zhì* (至), *Zhī* (知), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) actually constitute a **merged rhyme** (支、脂合韵) of *Zhī* (支) and *Zhǐ* (脂).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **44 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version matches it.

Below the sentence *“Shú zhī qí gù”* (孰知其故), all other manuscripts include *“Shìyǐ shèngrén yóu nán zhī”* (是以圣人犹难之)—“Therefore, even the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult.”\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yùzhù* (御注), and *Jǐngfú* (景福) versions all read *“Zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (知此两者), while the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Gēng* (庚) and *Rén* (壬) manuscripts render it *“Cháng zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (常知此两者)—“**constantly knowing** these two.”\n\n**My examination** (谦之案) confirms that the *Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Shuòzhōu* (遂州) versions also omit *“Shìyǐ shèngrén yóu nán zhī”* (是以圣人犹难之). The *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Rén* (壬) versions write *“shā”* (杀) as *“○”* (空). The *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gāo Yè* (高翿), and *Nǎi* (柰) volumes read *“Zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (知此两者), while *Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) render it *“Cháng zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (常知此两者). The *Huáinán Zǔ*’s *Dàoyìng Xuàn* (道应训) citation matches the second sentence, and the *Rénjiān Xuàn* (人间训) states: *“One may be **courageous** (勇) in daring, yet still fail to be **courageous** (勇) in not daring.”* The *Lièzǐ* (列子) *“Lìmìng Piān”* (力命篇) also quotes this chapter: *“Lǎo Dān (老聃) spoke to Guān Yǐn (关尹): ‘What the **Heavenly** (天) **Dao/Way** **disdains** (恶), who can **fathom its reason** (故)?’ He meant that **aligning with** (迎) **Heaven’s intent** (天意) and **gauging** (揣) **benefit/harm** (利害) is not as good as **letting it be** (不如其已).” All these passages derive from this chapter.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) appears in other versions but should be deleted, following the stele version. **Mǎ Xùlún** (马叙伦) asserts: *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) is an **erroneous repetition** (错简复出) from **Chapter 63**; the *Yìzhōu* (易州) version lacks it, confirming this.\n\n---\nThe **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** (天) does not **strive** (争) yet **conquers through virtue** (善胜), does not **speak** (言) yet **responds harmoniously** (善应), does not **summon** (召) yet **comes of its own accord** (自来), and **spontaneously** (繟) **plans with virtue** (善谋).\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *“Bù zhào ér lái, rán ér shàn móu”* (不召而来，然而善谋) has *“lái”* (来) followed by an **uninscribed character** (未刻). The *Yùzhù* (御注), *Wáng Bì* (王弼), and *Gāo Yè* (高翿) versions write *“繟”* (繟), while the *Shìwén* (释文) cites *Liáng Wáng Shàng* (梁王尚), *Zhōng Huì* (锺会), *Sūn Dēng* (孙登), and *Zhāng Sì* (张嗣) as rendering *“繟tán”* (繟坦) and *Héshàng* (河上) as *“墠”* (墠). Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: *“Shìwén”* (释文) records: *“墠 (墠), ‘Tán’ (坦) is the reading of Liáng Wáng Shàng (梁王尚), Zhōng Huì (锺会), Sūn Dēng (孙登), and Zhāng Sì (张嗣).”* The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Gēng* (庚) version also uses *“tán”* (坦), while the *Xīn* (辛) and *Rén* (壬) versions read *“bùyán”* (不言)—“does not speak.”\n\n**My examination** (谦之案) finds that both *“繟”* (繟) and *“坦”* (坦) appear in the text; the stele version leaves a **blank space** (空一格) for an **unclear character** (何字不明). The *Yán* (严), *Péng* (彭), and *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之) versions use *“tán”* (坦), while the *Nǎi* (柰) volume renders *“繟”* (繟). **Fāng Yǐzhì** (方以智) states: *“繟tán”* (繟坦) and *“tánrán”* (坦然) and *“dànrán”* (啴然) are **interchangeable** (互通). **Jiāo Shì Yì** (焦氏翼) notes: *“繟tán”* (繟坦) is pronounced *“jiǎn”* (阐); *Wáng* (王) reads *“tán”* (坦), *Yán* (严) reads *“mò”* (默), but *“bùrú”* (不如) with *“繟”* (繟) is the **longer reading** (为长).” **My examination** (智按) finds that *Wáng Fǔsì*’s (王辅嗣) annotation also uses *“tánrán”* (坦然) and is acceptable. *“Dān”* (单) and *“dàn”* (亶) were **anciently interchangeable** (古通), just as *“zhuǎn”* (嬗) and *“chán”* (禅) or *“niáng”* (儃) and *“dàn”* (啴). *“Dàn”* (啴) shares the pronunciation of *“dān”* (单) and *“shàn”* (善), meaning **gentle** (缓); its sound *“dàn”* (啴) conveys **gentleness** (缓), hence the Tang usage of *“dànrán”* (啴然)—“**spontaneously gentle**.” (from *Tōngyǎ* (通雅) Vol. 8) **Lú Wénpián** (卢文弨) remarks: *“繟”* (繟), *“tán”* (坦), and *“wán”* (墠) share **similar pronunciations** (音相近) and may be **interchangeably used** (得通用).\n\nThe *Dà Tián Qíng Xuān* (大田晴轩) states:\n*\"Tánrán* (坦然) is a **level and open** appearance.\nIt speaks of the **Dao’s** plain simplicity—seeming without contrivance—yet **harmonizing** (歙), **balancing** (张), **uniting** (与), **taking** (奪), and **acting wisely** (善谋) without error.\n\n*Tánrán* (坦然) is sometimes written as *jiǎnrán* (繟然), with *jiǎn* (繟) pronounced *chǎn* (阐), conveying a **relaxed and unhurried** demeanor—also acceptable.\n\n**My examination** (今案) finds that the *Yán* (严) edition reads *“mò”* (默), which aligns with antiquity. Other variants—*“jiǎn”* (繟) or *“tán”* (坦)—are incorrect. Both *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions also read *“mò”* (默).\n*Fàn* (范) notes:\n*\"The character* **mò** (默) *matches* **Fù Yì**’s (傅奕) ancient text. The *Héshàng* (河上公) and *Kāiyuán Yùzhù* (开元御注) editions read* **jiǎn** (繟), *while* **Wáng Bì** (王弼), *Liáng Wáng Shàng* (梁王尚), *Sūn Dēng* (孙登), and *Zhāng Sì* (张嗣) read *“tán”* (坦). We follow the ancient text here.*\n\nFurther, in *Wáng Chōng*’s (王充) *Lún Héng* (论衡), *Chū Bǐng* (初禀) chapter:\n*\"People gather without summons, auspicious things arrive without invitation—**dimly harmonious** (ànrán 褪然), the **Dao’s** natural unfolding.\"*\nThis draws from *Lǎozǐ*’s chapter here, but renders *“tánrán”* (坦然) as *“ànrán”* (褪然).\nThis character was uncarved in the *Jǐnglóng* (景龡) stele but appears in *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) editions as *“bùyán”* (不言), which also means *“ànrán”* (褪然).\nThe *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions read *“mòrán”* (默然), which shares both form and meaning with *“ànrán”* (褪然)—one must be correct, and we follow it.\n\n*\"Tiānwǎng huīhuī, shū ér bù lòu\"* (天网恢恢，疏而不漏).\n*Yán Kějūn* (严可均) notes: Most editions read *“bù shī”* (不失).\n*Bì Qiān* (毕沅) states: The *Héshàng* (河上公) edition reads *“wù”* (勿) instead of *“bù”* (不).\n**My examination** (谦之案) confirms *“bù lòu”* (不漏) is correct.\n*Sūn Kuàng* (孙矿) in *Gǔjīn Běn Kǎo Zhèng* (古今本考正) states:\n*\"‘Shū ér bù shī’ (疏而不失)—‘shī’ (失) is sometimes written as ‘lòu’ (漏).\"*\nThe *Hòuhànshū* (后汉书) *Dù Lín* (杜林) transmission and *Wèishū* (魏书) *Jǐngmù Shíèr Zhì* (景穆十二志) both cite *“shī”* (失) as *“lòu”* (漏).\nThe *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要) also uses *“lòu”* (漏).\nThe *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) defines *“lòu”* (漏) as *“lìdòu” (力豆切), meaning “to leak” (漏泄).\nThe *Huáinán Tàizú* (淮南泰族) states *“zhūxián lòuyuè”* (朱弦漏越), with the note *“to pierce” (穿).\n*“Bù lòu”* (不漏) means neither leaking nor piercing—thus also *“bù shī”* (不失).\n\n---\n**Phonology (音韵):**\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme readings for this chapter:\n- *shā* (杀), *huó* (活), *hài* (害) — **Sacrificial Department** (祭部): *shā* (杀) as *“shè”* (设), *huó* (活) as *“hújué”* (胡厥反), *hài* (害) as *“húzhé”* (胡折反).\n- *è* (恶), *gù* (故) — **Fish Department** (鱼部).\n- *shèng* (胜), *yìng* (应) — **Steaming Department** (蒸部).\n- *lái* (来), *móu* (谋) — **Zhi Department** (之部).\n\n「Maó Wéntián agrees with this.\n\nXī Dòng: *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活) form a rhyme, but does not extend to *“hài”* (害).\nChén Zhù: *lái* (来), *móu* (谋), *huī* (恢), and *shī* (失) form a rhyme.\n\nRegarding *“hài”* (害), in ancient readings it was *“jié”* (割). The *Shīmíng* (释名) states: *“Hài* (害), to cut—like cutting or carving things.” It also corresponds to *“hé”* (曷), as in *Mèngzǐ* (孟子): *“Shí rì hài sàng?”* (时日害丧?). The *“hài”* (害) in Chapter Thirty-Five of the *Jīng* (经) is pronounced with a departing tone, rhyming with *tài* (太). Here, *“hài”* (害) is an entering tone, rhyming with *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活). Jiāng Yǒuhuì’s *Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng* (唐韵四声正) states *“hài”* (害) is *“húgài”* (胡盖切). Anciently, there was an entering tone for *“hài”* (害), which should be grouped with the *Hé* (曷) department. In *Lǎozǐ* (老子) *Rènwéi* (任为篇): *“Cǐ liǎng zhě huò lì huò hài”* (此两者或利或害), *“hài”* (害) rhymes with *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活). Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *“Shā* (杀), *huó* (活), and *hài* (害) form a rhyme. *“Hài”* (害) belongs to the *Jì* (祭) Department, while *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活) are its entering-tone variants. In the *Shījīng* (诗经) *Liǎo’áo* (蓼莪) Chapter Five, *“liè”* (烈), *“fā”* (发), and *“hài”* (害) rhyme—this serves as proof.\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **58 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version, **57**; while the *Héshàng* (河上), *Wáng* (王), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) versions all contain **64 characters**.\n*Héshàng* (河上) titles this *“Rènwéi* (任为) **Chapter 73**,” the *Wáng* (王) version titles it *“Chapter 73,”* and the *Fàn* (范) version titles it *“Yǒngyú Gǎn* (勇于敢) **Chapter 73**.”\n\n**Chapter 74**\n*Mín bù wèi sǐ* (民不畏死), *nàihé yǐ sǐ jù zhī?* (奈何以死惧之?)\nIf one were to make the people always fear death, and yet act in ways deemed extraordinary—what would I gain by seizing and killing them?

The *«jīn»* (金) radical added to *«○»* (○) by later scholars is redundant.\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* further explains that *«dǒu»* (斗) is composed of *«dǒu»* (斗) and the phonetic *«zhuó»* (斲), while *«○»* (○) is composed of *«xiàn»* (见) and the phonetic *«○»* (○), both pronounced as *«dōu»* (兜), following the same pattern.\n\nIn the *Dàodé Shū* (道德书) chapter *«Zhì Huò»* (制惑), it states:\n*«Fú dài sī shā zhě, shì wèi dài dàjiàng zhuó; fú dài dàjiàng zhuó zhě, xī yǒu bù shāng qí shǒu yǐ»* (夫代司杀者，是谓代大匠斲；夫代大匠斲者，希有不伤其手矣),\nwhere *«zhuó»* (斲) rhymes with *«shǒu»* (手).\n\nThe *«Guì Kě»* (贵可) section of the *Lǚ Shì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋) states:\n*«Gù yuē: dàjiàng bù zhuó, dàpáo bù dòu, dàyǒng bù dòu, dàbīng bù kòu»* (故曰大匠不斲，大庖不豆，大勇不斗，大兵不寇).\nThe *Huáinán Shuōlín* (淮南说林) contains a similar passage.\n\nThus, the original pronunciation of *«zhuó»* (斲) should align with *«dǒu»* (斗), with *zhújiǎo* (竹角切) being its evolved sound.\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **55 characters**, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) manuscript **54**, the *Héshàng* (河上) version **56**, *Wáng Bì* (王弼)’s text **59**, *Fù* (傅)’s **61**, and *Fàn* (范)’s **60**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* (河上) version titles this as *«Zhì Huò, Chapter 74»* (制惑第七十四), *Wáng Bì* (王弼) as *«Chapter 74»* (七十四章), and *Fàn* (范) as *«Mín Cháng Bù Wèi Sǐ, Chapter 74»* (民常不畏死章第七十四).\n\n**[Chapter 75]**」\n\nThe people’s hunger arises because their lords consume too much in taxes—hence, they hunger.\n**Yán Kējūn** (严可均) remarks: *«Mín zhī jī»* (民之饥) is rendered *«Rén zhī»* (人之) in the **Imperial Commentary** (御注).\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: In the **Imperial Commentary** (御注), the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) manuscript *Xīn* (辛) version, and all other manuscripts, the character *«mín»* (民) is uniformly written as *«rén»* (人).\n*«Jī»* (饥) is consistently written *«jī»* (饥) across all versions; the same below. **Qiánzhī** (谦之) observes: The *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), *Héshàng* (河上), *Gù* (顾), *Zhào* (赵), and all *Wáng* (王) versions uniformly write *«mín»* (民), while the *Shìzhōu* (遂州), *Xíng Xuàn* (邢玄), *Yán* (严), and the *Hòushǔ* (后汉书) passage from **Láng Pī** (郎顗)’s transmission all write *«rén»* (人). In the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions, *«jī»* (饥) is followed by *«zhě»* (者). **Bì Qián** (毕沅) states:\n*«Jī»* (饥), in the *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions, is uniformly written *«jī»* (饥).\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) further notes: Ancient *«jī jǐn»* (饥馑) was written *«jī»* (饥), and *«jī è»* (饥饿) was written *«è»* (饿). Here, it should be *«jī»* (饥), not *«è»* (饿).\nThe **Imperial Commentary** (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Xíng Xuàn* (邢玄), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), *Héshàng* (河上), *Gù* (顾), *Yán* (严), *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Zhào* (赵), *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要), and the *Hòushǔ* (后汉书) passage from **Láng Pī** (郎顗)’s transmission all write *«jī»* (饥).\nAdditionally, the *Dàozàng* (道藏) *Sòng Zhāng Táishǒu* (宋张太守) edition of the **Four Commentaries** (四家注) cites *Wáng Bì* (王弼)’s commentary: *«The reason the people stray and governance falls into disorder is that the lords do not follow those beneath them; the people follow their lords.»*\nBelow, it further states: *«I suspect this is not the work of Lǎozǐ (老子).»*\n\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed stems from their lords’ scheming—hence, they are hard to govern.\n\nThe people’s disregard for death arises from the depth of their attachment to life—thus, they hold death lightly.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) remarked: *«The depth of their attachment to life»* (生生之厚) is rendered *«attachment to life»* (求生) in other editions.\n\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) noted: *«Attachment to life»* (求生) appears as *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生) in the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions.\n\nIn my examination: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Péng* (彭), and *Fàn* (范) editions read *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生), while the *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之), and *Zhào Mèngfǔ* (赵孟俯) editions render it *«attachment to life»* (求生). The *Gāoxì* (高翿) edition has *«life’s attachment»* (生求), and the *Fù* (傅) edition reads *«attachment to life’s life»* (求生生).\n**Yán** (严) omits *«from»* (以其), while the *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Péng*, and *Nǎijuàn* editions add *«also»* (也) after *«depth»* (厚).\nMy rendering as *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生之厚) is correct.\n**Yì Shùndǐng** (易顺鼎) stated: *«Attachment to life’s depth»* (求生之厚) should be *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生之厚).\nThe *Wén Xuǎn* (文选) passage from the **Ordos Attribution** (魏都赋) reads: *«where life’s attachment is ever profound»* (生生之所常厚), and **Zhāng Zǎi** (张载) cited the *Lǎozǐ* (老子) as saying: *«The people’s disregard for death arises from the depth of their attachment to life»* (人之轻死，以其生生之厚也).\nThis suggests they understand life’s attachment so deeply that they cherish it.\nThis confirms that the original text read *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生).\nThe *Huáinán* (淮南) **Spiritual Training** (精神训), the *Wén Xuǎn* **Cuckoo Attribution** (鹪鹩赋注), and **Róngqíng Suíbǐ** (容斋随笔) all cite *«the depth of their attachment to life»* (生生之厚), further validating this.\nThe **Fifty-Eighth Chapter** (五十章) states: *«Why is this so? From the depth of their attachment to life»* (夫何故？以其生生之厚), again confirming this reading within the text itself.\n\nOnly those who do not cherish life as their highest value are wiser than those who do.\n**Wú Yún** (吴云) noted: The *Fù* (傅) edition reads *«Only those who do not cherish life as their highest value are wiser than those who do»* (无以生为贵者，是贤于贵生也), while **Wáng Bì** (王弼) omits the first *«cherish»* (贵).\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) remarked: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition adds *«life»* (生) after *«value»* (为).\nThe *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition places *«also»* (也) after *«cherish»* (生).\nIn my examination: The opening phrase aligns with the *Guāngmíng* (广明), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之), and *Zhào Mèngfǔ* (赵孟俯) editions, while **Xíng Xuàn** (邢玄) matches the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition.\nAfter *«cherish life»* (贵生), the *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) editions, along with the *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要) citation, all include *«also»* (也), while the *Huáinán* **Dao/Way Application** (道应训) adds *«thus»* (焉).\nFurthermore, the *Huáinán* **Spiritual Training** (精神训) reads:\n*«Why do people fail to complete their natural lifespan and perish prematurely by punishment? It is from the depth of their attachment to life. Only those who do not cherish life as their highest value can thereby attain life’s longevity.»*\n(夫人之所以不能终其寿命而中道夭于刑戮者，何也？以其生生之厚。夫惟能无以生为者，则所以修得生也。)\nThis also follows the original, except that *Huáinán* (淮南) alters *«long»* (长) to *«attain»* (修) to avoid the father’s taboo name.\n**Yú Yì** (俞樾) said: *«Attain life’s longevity»* (修得生) was originally *«attain longevity»* (得修生), meaning *«attain longevity»* (得长生).\nThe **Wénzǐ** (文子) **Ten Guardians** (十守篇) correctly reads: *«Only those who do not cherish life as their highest value are thereby attaining longevity»* (夫唯无以生为者，即所以得长生).\nI suspect the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text included this sentence before *«wiser than those who do»* (贤于贵生).\nThe **Seventh Chapter** (七章) states: *«Because they do not rely on life’s self-creation, they can attain longevity»* (以其不自生，故能长生), and the **Fifty-Ninth Chapter** (五十九章) speaks of *«the Dao/Way of attaining longevity and enduring vision»* (长生久视之道).\nThe term *«attaining longevity»* (长生) appears three times here, confirming this reading.\nAdditionally, each segment of this chapter consists of three sentences, where *«wiser than those who do»* (是贤于贵生) pairs with *«thus, they hold death lightly»* (是以轻死) as a parallel structure.\n\n**Rhyming Analysis**:\nAccording to **Jiāng Shì** (江氏), this chapter lacks rhyme in his readings.\n**Yáo Wéntián** (姚文田), **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢), and **Xí Zòng** (奚侗) concur.\n**Chén Zhù** (陈柱) noted: *«Hunger»* (饥) rhymes with *«govern»* (治), *«death»* (死) rhymes with *«death»* (死).\nIn my examination: *«Hunger»* (饥) should be read as *«hunger»* (饥), as explained earlier.\nMoreover, the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition adds *«life»* (生) after *«value»* (为).\n*«Thus, they hold death lightly»* (是以轻死) and *«wiser than those who do»* (是贤于贵生) also rhyme with *«life»* (生).\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele edition does not divide chapters, consisting of **52 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition has **53 characters** (actually **54**); the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions each have **53 characters**; and the *Fù* (傅) edition has **63 characters**, while the *Fàn* (范) edition has **60 characters**.\nThe **Héshàng** (河上) edition is titled *«Chapter on Greed and Loss, Seventy-Fifth»* (贪损第七十五), the **Wáng** (王) edition as *«Seventy-Fifth Chapter»* (七十五章), and the *Fàn* (范) edition as *«Chapter on the People’s Hunger, Seventy-Fifth»* (民之饥章第七十五).\n\n**Seventy-Sixth Chapter** (七十六章):\nThe softness and frailty of life, yet its rigidity and strength in death.\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) remarked: *«The softness and frailty of life»* (人生之) was originally *«the softness and frailty of life»* (人之生也), while **Gāoxì** (高翿) reads *«the people’s softness and frailty of life»* (民之生也).\n*«Yet its rigidity and strength in death»* (其死), other editions render as *«in death, its rigidity and strength»* (其死也).\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) noted: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions omit both *«also»* (也) characters, and the following two sentences match.\nThe *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition renders *«rigidity»* (坚) as *«strength»* (刚).\nIn my examination: The **Héshàng** (河上), **Wáng** (王), and *Fù* (傅) editions all include both *«also»* (也) characters, while the *Fàn* (范) edition matches but renders *«rigidity and strength»* (坚强) as *«strength and strength»* (刚强).\nThe **Sayings of the Masters** (说苑) **Respect and Caution** (敬慎篇) also cites *«rigidity»* (坚) as *«strength»* (刚), with the rest of the text identical.\nThis likely reflects the interchange of *«rigidity»* (坚) and *«strength»* (刚) as true and false readings, akin to the **I Ching** (易) passage *«rigidity and softness interacting»* (刚柔相摩), which **Yì Shì** (易系) cites as *«rigidity and softness»* (坚柔).\nThe *Wén Xuǎn* (文选) passage from the **Seat-Right Inscription** (座右铭) omits *«of»* (之), and the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) and **Yán** (严) editions also omit the two *«also»* (也) characters.\nThis chapter emphasizes the preciousness of life’s softness and frailty—its skin and vitality—capable of bending and stretching, thus demonstrating the value of softness.\nAll things, grasses and trees, are soft and brittle in their living state, yet rigid and withered in death.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) remarked: *«In their living state»* (生之) is rendered *«in life»* (生也) in the **Imperial Commentary** (御注), while the original reads *«living state’s»* (之生也).\n*«Yet rigid in death»* (其死), other editions render as *«in death, yet rigid»* (其死也).\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) noted: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition reads *«living state’s softness and frailty»* (生之柔毳), and the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition matches but renders *«frailty»* (毳) as *«brittleness»* (脆).\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) remarked: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), **Imperial Commentary** (御注), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions all read *«in their living state»* (生之), while the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) edition omits *«also»* (也) and *«withered»* (枯).\n\n「Yán Kějūn’s case notes: The *Imperial Commentary* (御注) renders *«in life»* (生也), but **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) erred in this correction. The *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), and *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) editions all agree. **Yán** (严), **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), and **Zhào** (赵) omit the *«all things»* (万物) phrase. The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition renders *«brittleness»* (脆) as *«frailty»* (毳), which is likely an alternate form of *«brittleness»* (脆).\n\nFurthermore, in the *Wénxuǎn* (文选), under the *Lúlíng Wáng Mùxià* (庐陵王墓下) poem, there is a commentary citing lost passages from *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子): *«Those that are soft and frail in life are withered and rigid in death»* (其生也柔脆者，死者枯槁). Thus, the strong and rigid are destined for death, while the soft and frail are destined for life. **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) noted: The *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) edition reads *«thus it is said»* (故曰).\n\n**Jiǎng Xíchāng** (蒋锡昌) remarked: The *Huáinán Yuándào Xuàn* (淮南原道训) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life’s vitality (干), while the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱者生之干也，而坚强者死之徒也). The *Wénzǐ Dàoyuán Piān* (文子道原篇) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life’s vitality (干), the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱者生之干，坚强者死之徒). The *Shuōyuàn Jìngshèn Piān* (说苑敬慎篇) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life, the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱者生之徒也，刚强者死之徒也). The *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life, the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱者生之徒，坚强者死之徒). The *Yùlǎn Mùbù* (御览木部) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life, the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱生之徒，刚强死之徒). All place *«the strong and rigid»* (坚强) sentence below *«the soft and frail»* (柔弱) sentence, suggesting that the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text may have followed this order. Thus, *«strong armies perish, rigid trees are felled»* (兵强则不胜，木强则折).\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** case notes: *«Rigid trees are felled»* (木则折) is rendered *«trees are felled»* (木则共) in the *Imperial Commentary* (御注), *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Xíngshàng* (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gāo Yì* (高翿), *Nǎi Juàn* (柰卷), *Héshàng* (河上), *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之), *Gǔ* (顾), *Fàn* (范), *Péng* (彭), *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions. The *Zhūwáng* (诸王) editions render *«armies»* (兵), while the *Dàozàng Wáng* (道藏王) edition renders *«are felled»* (折). The *Jīngxùn Táng Fù* (经训堂傅) edition renders *«armies»* (兵), while the *Dàozàng Fù* (道藏傅) edition renders *«are felled»* (共). The meaning of *«共»* (共) remains unclear.\n\nThe *Běnchéng Shū* (本成疏) states: *«Like trees that split apart when divided, their branches and twigs press down upon them; or like grand beams and pillars, where rafters and tiles press down upon them»* (譬树木分，故枝条共压其上； 亦犹梁栋宏壮，故椽瓦共压其上也). Thus, it is known that the edition *Běnchéng* (本成) saw also renders *«are felled»* (共).\n\n**Dīng Zhòngyòu** (丁仲佑) said: *«共»* (共) is a contracted form of *«拱»* (gōng, \"to arch or embrace\"), as seen in the *Jíyùn* (集韵). The *Gǔliáng* (谷梁) commentary on *Lǐsānshí Sānnián* (僖三十三年) states: *«拱,合抱也»* (\"*Gōng*, to embrace with both arms.\"), and the *Gōngyáng* (公羊) commentary also notes: *«拱,可以手对抱»* (\"*Gōng*, to embrace with hands clasped.\"). Though this explanation can be understood, *«trees are felled»* (木则兵) still aligns better with the saying *«the straight tree is felled first»* (直木先伐), making the latter meaning more plausible.\n\n**Huáng Màocái** (黄茂材) said: *«Lièzǐ* (列子) records the words of *Lǎodān* (老聃): *«Strong armies perish, rigid trees are felled»* (兵则灭，木则折). The *Lièzǐ* (列子) text largely follows the teachings of *Lǎozǐ* (老子), and its era is not distant from his. *«Rigid trees are felled»* (木则折) is a natural phrasing. Now, *«共»* (共) is rendered as *«拱»* (gōng), which does not make sense—*Lièzǐ* (列子) should be considered authoritative.»\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** case notes: **Huáng**’s (黄) explanation is correct. *«灭»* (miè, \"perish\") and *«折»* (zhé, \"fell\") form a rhyme. *«折»* (zhé) in seal script is written as ○, and appears under the *Cǎo* (艹) radical in the *Shuōwén* (说文). **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) said: *«In ancient texts, 『折』 (zhé) may sometimes be written as ○, as its seal form is extremely close to that of 『兵』 (bīng).」*\n\n**Gāo Hēng** (高亨) also stated: *«Ancient 『折』 (zhé) was sometimes written as ○, with 『斤』 (jīn) above and 『艹』 (cǎo) below, resembling 『兵』 (bīng) in form, hence the confusion.»*\n\n**Yú Yì** (俞樾) noted: *«木则兵»* (木则兵) is difficult to interpret, and the *Héshàng* (河上) edition’s *«木则共»* (木则共) is even more so. The original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text likely read *«木则折»* (木则折), but the *«折»* (zhé) character was damaged, leaving only its right radical *«斤»* (jīn), which, combined with the preceding *«兵则不胜»* (兵则不胜), led to its misinterpretation as *«兵»* (bīng). *«共»* (共) is further confusion from *«兵»* (bīng). The *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) cites *Lǎodān* (老聃) as saying *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), which can be used to correct this passage.\n\n**Yì Shùndǐng** (易顺鼎) added: **Yú**’s (俞) balanced analysis, citing *Lièzǐ* (列子) and the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text as *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), is correct. **Dǐng** (鼎) further notes that the *Wénzǐ Dàoyuán Piān* (文子道原篇) reads *«兵即灭，木即折»* (兵即灭，木即折), and the *Huáinán Yuándào Xuàn* (淮南原道训) also reads *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), all consistent with *Lièzǐ* (列子). **Wáng**’s (王) annotation of *«木则兵»* (木则兵) states *«物所加也»* (\"*What is imposed by things*\"), which likely is not the original text. **Xí Zhòng** (奚侗) said: *«折»* (zhé) was mistakenly read as *«兵»* (bīng) due to damage, and then further confused as *«共»* (共) because of similar shapes. Now, we correct it based on the *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) and *Wénzǐ Dàoyuán Piān* (文子道原篇).\n\nHowever, in *Wénzǐ* (文子) and *Huáinán* (淮南), below *«rigid trees are felled»* (木强则折), there are additional rhyming phrases: *«strong leather cracks, firm teeth on the tongue wear out first»* (革强则裂，齿坚于舌而先敝). These may have been part of the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text but are now omitted. Thus, the strong and rigid are placed below, while the soft and frail are placed above.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) noted: Other editions render *«strong and rigid are placed below»* (强大处下) without *«thus»* (故). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) remarked: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition reads *«thus the strong and rigid are below»* (故坚强居下), while the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) edition reads *«thus the strong and rigid are placed below»* (故强大处下).\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** (严可均) case notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Péng** (彭), and **Fù** (傅) editions render *«处»* (chǔ) as *«居»* (jū). The *Gāo* (高) edition in *Hàn* (汉) renders both *«处»* (chǔ) as *«居»* (jū). **Yán** (严) renders *«柔»* (soft) as *«小»* (xiǎo, \"small\"). The phrase *«strong and rigid are placed below»* (坚强处下) is consistent in **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), and **Zhào** (赵) editions.\n\nThis is likely an analogy using grass and trees to illustrate that the rigid roots and trunks are placed below, while the soft branches and leaves are above.\n\n**【Phonology & Rhyme】** This chapter, as read by **Jiāng Shì** (江氏), lacks rhyme. **Yáo Wéntián** (姚文田) and **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) concur.\n\n「**Xī Dòng** (奚侗) notes: The rhymes are *miè* (灭) and *zhé* (折).\n　　**Chén Zhù** (陈柱) notes: The rhymes are *tú* (徒) and *tú* (徒).\n　　The *Gāo* (高) edition in *Hàn* (汉) further notes: The rhymes are *shèng* (胜) and *bīng* (兵), then *xià* (下) and *shàng* (上).\n　　**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: *Shèng* (胜), *bīng* (兵), *xià* (下), and *shàng* (上) are not rhymes; **Gāo** (高) is in error.\n\n　　**Muneo Takeuchi** (武内义雄) states: *«When strength is excessive, it is extinguished; when roots are rigid, they are broken»* (兵强则灭，本强则折), as quoted in the *Huángdì Piān* (黄帝篇) of the *Lièzǐ* (列子) from **Lǎo Dān** (老聃). This phrase also appears in the **Lǎozi** (老子)'s 76th chapter, though the wording differs. The rhymes are *miè* (灭) and *zhé* (折).\n\n　　The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele edition contains **54 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition matches this. The *Héshàng* (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions contain **57 characters**; **Fù** (傅) has **59**; and **Fàn** (范) has **58**. The *Héshàng* (河上) edition is titled *«Admonition Against Strength, Chapter 76»* (戒强第七十六); the **Wáng** (王) edition is titled *«Chapter 76»* (七十六章); and **Fàn** (范) is titled *«Chapter 76 of the Generation of Man»* (人之生章第七十六).\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao/Way of Heaven**\n　　The Dao/Way of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow!\n\n　　**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: The *Yù Zhù* (御注) and *Héshàng* (河上) editions render *«drawing of a bow»* (张弓) as *«drawing of a bow, is it not?»* (张弓乎); **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders it as *«drawing of a bow, with»* (张弓与).\n　　**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition and the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition both lack the *«with»* (与) character. The *Yù Zhù* (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) editions render *«with»* (与) as *«is it not?»* (乎).\n　　**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) and **Yán** (严) editions also lack the *«with»* (与) character. The **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) editions add *«is it not?»* (欤) under *«bow»* (弓).\n\n　　The editions of **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷), **Gāo Qì** (高翿), **Gù** (顾), and **Péng** (彭) all render *«drawing of a bow, is it not?»* (张弓乎), consistent with the citation in *Lèijù* (类聚) Chapter 74.\n\n　　When the bowstring is high, it is pressed down; when it is low, it is raised up. When there is excess, it is diminished; when there is deficiency, it is supplemented.\n\n　　**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: The phrase *«when there is deficiency, it is supplemented»* (不足者与之) is rendered as *«it is supplemented»* (补之) by **Wáng Bì** (王弼).\n　　**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: The *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) editions lack the *«it»* (者) character; the same holds for the following sentence. Moreover, the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yù Zhù* (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Xīn* (辛) editions all render *«supplemented»* (补) as *«with»* (与).\n　　**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), **Gāo Qì** (高翿), **Yán** (严), **Gù** (顾), and **Péng** (彭) editions lack the *«with»* (而) character. The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Yán** (严), and **Gù** (顾) editions also lack the *«with»* (以) character under *«deficiency»* (足). The **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Héshàng** (河上), **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Gù** (顾), and **Péng** (彭) editions all render *«it is supplemented»* (与之), consistent with this reading.\n\n　　Furthermore, **Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: **Yán Zūn** (严遵) states: *«As for the bow, when a man draws it, it is both stretched and relaxed, both drawn and released, regulated by compass and square, governed by plumb line and level. The taut, high string is slackened and eased; the slack, low string is gathered and raised. If there is excess, it is trimmed and diminished; if there is deficiency, it is filled and augmented.»* (夫弓人之为弓也，既○既生，既翕既张，制以规矩，督以准绳。 弦高急者，宽而缓之； 弦驰下者，摄而上之； 其有余者，削而损之； 其不足者，补而益之。) Based on this, one understands that the four sentences illustrate the natural principles of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness through the analogy of drawing a bow.\n\n　　**Jiāo Jǐng** (焦竑) states: *«The two sentences of \"press down\" (抑之) and \"raise up\" (举之) speak of drawing a bow, while the two sentences of \"excess\" (有余) and \"deficiency\" (不足) speak of the Dao/Way of Heaven»* (「抑之」、「举之」二句言张弓，「有余」、「不足」二句言天道), which is incorrect.\n\n　　The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency; **human Dao/Way** (人道) is otherwise, diminishing deficiency and indulging excess.\n\n　　**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *«and supplements deficiency»* (而补不足), the *Yù Zhù* (御注) edition lacks the *«and»* (而) character. *«Human Dao/Way»* (人道) is rendered as *«the Dao/Way of man»* (人之道) in all editions. Under *«diminishing deficiency»* (损不足), the character *«deficiency»* (足) has *«with»* (以) appended in all editions.\n\n　　**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: The *Yù Zhù* (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚), and *Xīn* (辛) editions all lack the *«and»* (而) character. The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions all lack the *«with»* (以) character, while the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) edition renders *«with»* (以) as *«and»* (而).\n\n　　**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), **Gāo Qì** (高翿), **Yán** (严), **Gù** (顾), and **Péng** (彭) editions all lack the *«and»* (而) character. The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Yán** (严), and **Gù** (顾) editions also lack the *«with»* (以) character under *«deficiency»* (足).\n\n　　**Yì Pèixiān** (易佩绅) states: *«The Dao/Way exists only in the balanced harmony of all things under Heaven. Once balanced, it is then fit for application.»* (道在天下均而已，均而后适于用。) When there is excess here and deficiency there, or deficiency here and excess there, all these are unfit for use.\n\n「But if it is too high, it is reduced—this is to diminish what is in excess; if it is too low, it is raised—this is to supplement what is deficient. The Dao/Way of Heaven is thus, and therefore its application is inexhaustible.\n\nYì Pèixiān (易佩绅) states: *«The Dao/Way of humanity is not so. He amasses wealth from the humble and lowly to curry favor with the noble and exalted; he oppresses them with rods and whips, drawing blood and taking every last coin. Yet to those above, he hoards riches without using them fully, or uses them as if they were mud and sand: diminishing what is deficient to serve what is in excess, thus differing from the Dao/Way of Heaven. Who can have excess to serve all under Heaven? Only the one who follows the Dao/Way.»*\n\n**Yán** (严) **Kějūn** (可均) notes: In the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition, *«with»* (以) is placed under *«can»* (能). *«Only the one who follows the Dao/Way»* (其唯有道者) lacks the *«only»* (其) character in all other editions.\n\nYì Pèixiān (易佩绅) states: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Guǎngmíng* (广明) editions all have *«with»* (以) under *«can»* (能). *«With excess»* (有余以), the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) editions lack the *«with»* (以) character.\n\n**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Fù* (傅) edition renders *«Who can diminish what is in excess and serve what is deficient under Heaven? Only the one who follows the Dao/Way, is it not so?»* (孰能损有余而奉不足于天下者，其惟道者乎). The **Yán** (严) and **Péng** (彭) editions also use *«diminish»* (损), with **Péng** (彭) including the *«deficient under»* (不足于) phrase. **Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) states: *«Who can serve all under Heaven with excess»* (孰能以有余奉天下), adding *«deficient»* (不足) is incorrect.\n\n**Yán** (严) **Kějūn** (可均) notes: *«Acts without claiming credit»* (为而不恃), the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition lacks the *«and»* (而) character. *«When virtue/power is achieved, does not claim it»* (功成不处), the *Héshàng* (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions have *«when»* (而) under *«achieved»* (成). *«This is why the sage is not seen»* (斯不见贤), all editions render *«This is why he does not wish to be seen»* (其不欲见贤), with **Gāo Qì** (高亨) adding *«is it not so?»* (邪) at the sentence's end.\n\n**Luò Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: *«When virtue/power is achieved and does not claim it»* (功成而不处), the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions render *«achieved»* (成) as *«success»* (成功). *«This is why he does not wish to be seen»* (斯不见贤), the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) edition adds *«also»* (也) under *«sage»* (贤), while the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition renders *«This is why he wishes to retire the sage»* (则其欲退贤). **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) states: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition renders *«seen»* (见) as *«show»* (示).\n\n**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Héshàng* (河上) annotation reads: *«He does not wish to show others his own virtue/power.»* Thus, *«seen»* (见) in the *Héshàng* (河上) edition is also rendered as *«show»* (示), as in **Gù Huān** (顾欢)'s version. The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition renders *«seen»* (见) as *«noble»* (贵). *«This»* (斯) is the same as *«collaborate»* (厮), with *«斯»* and *«厮»* being interchangeable ancient and modern characters. The *Zhōulǜ* (左传) *Āi* (哀) year 2 annotation reads: *«Release from labor.»* The *Shìwén* (释文) states: *«厮 is also written as 斯.»* In *Xīnxù* (新序) *Záshì* (杂事) 4 and *Qiánfū Lùn* (潜夫论) *Xùlù* (叙录), *«labor»* (役) is uniformly written as *«collaborate labor»* (斯役). Here, *«This is why the sage is not seen»* (斯不见贤), the *Máo* (毛) annotation to the *Shījīng* (诗经) states: *«贤, labor also.»* The sage can diminish what is in excess, supplement what is deficient, amass much to benefit the few, reduce the high and elevate the low—is this not laborious and burdensome service? The *Fù* (傅) edition adds *«is it not so?»* (邪) under *«sage»* (贤). **Gāo Hēng** (高亨) states: *«贤 should have「邪」 below it. This entire chapter is rhyme prose; without「邪」, the rhyme is lost—this is proof.»*\n\n**[Sound and Rhyme]** The *Jiāng* (江) edition's rhyme reading lacks rhyme. **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) notes: *«举»* and *«与»* rhyme, stating: *«『与』, one edition renders as『补』, and『举』,『补』 also rhyme.»* **Xí Dòng** (奚侗) agrees: *«举»* and *«补»* rhyme. **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) and **Gāo Běn Hàn** (高本汉) concur, adding *«余»* and *«下»* rhyme. **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) states: *«恃»* and *«处»* rhyme. **Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: All these explanations are incomplete. *«与»*, *«举»*, *«与»* (补), *«余»*, *«下»*, *«者»*, *«处»*, *«邪»* all belong to the *Yú* (鱼) rhyme category, truly making this a single rhyme throughout the entire chapter. *«恃»* and *«处»* do not rhyme—**Wǔnèi** (武内) is mistaken.\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele edition has 75 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition has 74, the *Héshàng* (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions have 79, the *Fù* (傅) edition has 77, and the **Fàn** (范) edition has 83. The *Héshàng* (河上) edition is titled *«The Dao/Way of Heaven, Chapter 77»*, the **Wáng** (王) edition *«Chapter 77»*, and the **Fàn** (范) edition *«The Dao/Way of Heaven, Chapter 77»*.\n\n**Chapter 77**\nAll under Heaven is naughty and weak, yet none can surpass water in attacking what is firm;\nstrong, yet none can overcome it. **Yán** (严) **Kějūn** (可均) states: **Wáng** (王) renders *«None can surpass water in naughtiness and weakness»* (天下莫柔弱于水).\n\nThe *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Wáng** (王), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions all lack the *«strong»* (强) character's *«者»* (者) and render *«overcome»* (胜) as *«exceed»* (先). The *Héshàng* (河上) edition also includes *«者»* (者), rendering *«None can exceed it»* (莫之能胜), while **Gāo Qì** (高翿) renders *«None can rival it»* (莫之能爽). **Luò Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: *«The *Héshàng* (河上) edition reads:『天下柔弱莫过于水』.* The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions all concur. *«Attack»* (攻), the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition renders as *«achievement»* (功). *«Strong»* (强者), the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions lack the *«者»* (者) character, while the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) edition adds *«Water is naughty and weak»* (言水柔弱) before this sentence. Additionally, the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions render *«overcome»* (胜) as *«exceed»* (先).\n\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) states: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), and *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) editions all render *«overcome»* (胜) as *«exceed»* (先). **Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) states: *«None is as naughty and weak as water under Heaven»* (天下柔弱莫过于水) or *«None is as naughty and weak as water»* (莫柔弱于水) is incorrect.\n\n**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Shìdétáng Héshàng Gōng* (世德堂河上公) edition renders *«None knows how to overcome it»* (莫知能胜). The *«know»* (知) character is erroneous.\n\n「Moreover, the sentence *«while attacking the hard»* (而攻坚) aligns in meaning with the forty-second chapter’s *«The utmost gentleness under Heaven overcomes the utmost hardness»* (天下之至柔，驰骋天下之至坚). The characters *«hard»* (坚) and *«overcomes»* (先) harmonize. Water can embrace mountains and level hills, grind iron and melt copper—thus it is said to *«attack the hard»* (攻坚). The old interpretation linking *«hard»* (坚) and *«strong»* (强) as a single term leaves no rhyme. Additionally, various editions append the character *«者»* after *«strong»* (强).\n\nThe character *«overcomes»* (先) is uniformly rendered as such in the editions of **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之), **Péng Yǔ** (彭裕), **Fù Yì** (傅奕), and **Fàn Zhì** (范注). There is no better alternative to it. **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) edition reads *«无易之»* (no alternative to it), while the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition renders it as *«以其无能易之»* (for it has no ability to alter it). **Jiāo Qióng** (焦竑) states: *«以其无以易之也»* (for there is nothing with which to replace it), omitting one *«以»* (also).\n\n**Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The **Yán** (严) edition appends the character *«矣»* (particle of completion), while the **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) editions append *«也»* (particle of emphasis). Thus, the weak *«overcome»* (胜) the strong, the soft *«overcome»* (胜) the hard, and none under Heaven can know or practice it.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: The *Guānzhù* (御注) and **Gāo Yì** (高翿) editions read *«故柔胜刚，弱胜强»* (Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong), while **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) omit the *«故»* (thus). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition renders *«柔之胜刚»* (the soft overcomes the hard) with *«胜»* (overcomes) as *«能»* (can), while the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) editions omit *«故»* (thus) and follow the same pattern. The *Guānzhù* (御注) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions read *«故柔胜刚，弱胜强»* (Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong). The character *«不»* (not) is uniformly rendered as *«能»* (can).\n\n**Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The *Huáinán Dàoyìng Xuàn* (淮南道应训) cites **Lǎozǐ** (老子) as saying: *«柔之胜刚也，弱之胜强也，天下莫不知，而莫之能行»* (The soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong; none under Heaven fail to know it, yet none can practice it). This matches the **Fù** (傅) edition, except the **Fù** (傅) edition lacks the two *«也»* (particles of emphasis).\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: The *Guānzhù* (御注) edition reads *«是以圣人言»* (Therefore, the Sage says), while **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders it as *«是以圣人云»*. **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition omits *«云»* (says), while the *Guānzhù* (御注) edition uses *«言»* (says) instead. The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition reads *«故圣人云»* (Therefore, the Sage says), and the *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) editions render it as *«故圣人言云»*. **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The **Nài** (柰) edition and **Héshàng** (河上) edition use *«云»* (says), while **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Qìngyáng** (庆阳), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Gāo** (高), **Gǔ** (顾), **Péng** (彭), **Fàn** (范), and **Zhào** (赵) editions all use *«言»* (says). The **Fù** (傅) edition appends *«之言»* (of the Sage) after *«人»* (Sage). The correct rendering is *«言»* (says). The characters *«言»* (says) and *«云»* (says) share overlapping meanings, and *«云»* (says) is a redundant addition.\n\n*«To bear a state’s filth is called the master of the soil and grain; to bear a state’s misfortunes is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.»*\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: *«受国不祥»* (to bear a state’s misfortunes), the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Gāo Yì** (高翿) editions append *«之»* (of) after *«国»* (state). **Sūn Kuàng** (孙矿) in his *Kǎozhèng* (考正) notes: *«受国不祥»* (to bear a state’s misfortunes), modern editions often append *«之»* (of) after *«受国»* (to bear a state). **Liú Shīpèi** (刘师培) states: Referring to the *Huáinán Dàoyìng Xuàn* (淮南道应训) citation of **Lǎozǐ** (老子), *«受国»* (to bear a state) is preceded by *«能»* (can) in all editions, and *«不祥»* (misfortunes) is also preceded by *«之»* (of)—this should be the ancient original. **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: *«垢»* (filth) carries the meaning of defilement and shame. According to the *Zhuāngzǐ Tiānxià Piān* (庄子天下篇) citation of **Lǎodān** (老聃): *«知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪；知其白，守其辱，为天下谷。人皆取先，己独取后，曰受天下之垢。」* **Guō Xiàng** (郭象) annotates: *«雌、辱、后、下之类»* (feminine, humiliation, later, lower—these are all what is termed as *«垢»* (filth) in things). In the *Zuǎnzhùán* (宣十五年左传), **Bó Zōng** (伯宗) says: *«川泽纳污，山薮藏疾，瑾瑜匿瑕，国君含垢，天之道也»* (Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor diseases, fine jade hides its flaws, and rulers bear the shame of their states—this is the Dao of Heaven). **Dù** (杜) annotates: *«忍垢耻»* (enduring filth and shame). Indeed, stepping back and placing oneself last, yielding to others first, and enduring what people abhor—this is nearly the Dao, the original meaning of *«垢»* (filth).\n\nThe character *«王»* (sovereign) is defined in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字): *«The place where all under Heaven turn toward»* (天下所归往也). The *Gǔliáng Zhuāngsān Zhuàn* (谷梁庄三传) states: *«Its saying ‘sovereign’ (王者), is the place where the people turn toward»* (其曰王者，民之所归往也). *«王»* (sovereign) is explained as *«往»* (toward), the place where people converge—this is the original meaning of *«王»* (sovereign). Correct speech seems contrary. **Gāo Yándì** (高延第) states: These words further elucidate the profound meaning of the Daoist discourse in the upper and lower chapters.\n\n「In all the passages where it is said *«The curved becomes whole, the bent becomes straight, the hollow becomes full, the worn becomes new»*, *«The yielding and weak overcome the strong and rigid»*, where *«that which is not born will endure longer»*, where *«non-action leads to action»*, where *«not contending means no one can contend with you»*, where *«knowing without speaking, speaking without knowing»*, where *«to diminish is to benefit, to benefit is to diminish»*, and where *«words seem contrary yet their principles harmonize»*, all are **correct speech**.\n\n**Wú Chéng** (吴澄) states: *«Correct speech seems contrary»* (正言若反) was taken by the old editions as the concluding sentence of the upper chapter. Now, upon examination, the upper chapter ends with *«The sage says»* (圣人云) followed by four sentences, their meaning already complete—it would be improper to append another sentence at the end, as no other chapter follows this format. The chapter *«Absent learning brings no worries»* (绝学无忧) and *«Sparse speech aligns with nature»* (希言自然) both begin with four characters as their thematic outline, and the rest elaborates. This chapter does the same.\n\nMoreover, the characters *«反»* (contrary), *«怨»* (grudge), and *«善»* (good) rhyme together, thus confirming that this sentence should serve as the **opening statement** (起语).\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) concurs: **Wú Chéng’s** (吴澄) interpretation is correct. *«Correct speech seems contrary»* (正言若反) appears in the **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙碑本) and **Yán’s edition** (严本) without chapter division, further validating this.\n\n**[Rhymes and Tones]** In this chapter, **Jiāng’s pronunciation** (江氏韵读) reads:\n- *«强»* (strong), *«刚»* (rigid), *«行»* (overcome) in the **Yáng rhyme category** (阳部)\n- *«垢»* (filth), *«主»* (sovereign) in the **Hóu rhyme category** (侯部, where *«主»* is pronounced as *«朱掫反»* [Zhǔ, rhyming with *chǔ*])\n- *«祥»* (auspicious), *«王»* (sovereign) in the **Yáng rhyme category** (阳部)\n- *«言»* (speaking), *«反»* (contrary) in the **Yuán rhyme category** (元部, where *«反»* is pronounced with a **level tone** [平声])\n\n**Yáo Wéndiàn** (姚文田) and **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) agree, though they overlooked *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary).\n**Gāohàn Yǐng** (高本汉) notes: *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary) rhyme.\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) mistakenly claims: *«祥»* (auspicious), *«王»* (sovereign), *«反»* (contrary) rhyme.\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) clarifies: *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary) belong to the next chapter. The rhyme of *«反»* (contrary), *«怨»* (grudge), and *«善»* (good) aligns with the **Jiāngjìn Third Decade rhyme** (江晋三廿一部谐声表入元部声), while **Yáo Wéndiàn** (姚文田) follows the **ancient pronunciation** (古音), harmonizing them under the **ninth *Hán* rhyme** (九寒去声). Thus, the three characters rhyme together.\n\nAdditionally, *«而攻坚»* (and assail the rigid) is a complete sentence, with *«坚»* (rigid) rhyming with *«先»* (first). This is as previously explained.\n\n**Gù Yànwú** (顾炎武) in his *Tángyùn Zhèngjuǎn* (唐韵正卷) under the **shòu rhyme** (厚) states: *«垢»* (filth) is pronounced **gū** (古) in ancient times.\nThe **Laozi** (老子) says: *«To endure a nation’s filth, one becomes its sovereign of soil and grain»* (受国之垢，是为社稷主).\n**Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) states: *«主»* (sovereign) in ancient pronunciation belongs to the **Hóu rhyme category** (侯部). In the *Yì* (易) *Fēng* (丰) hexagram, *«六二»* (sixth line, second) and *«九四»* (ninth line, fourth) rhyme with *«蔀»* (bamboo blind) and *«斗»* (dipper), while in the *Shījìng* (诗经) *Xíng* (行) ode, *«苇»* (reed) rhymes with *«醹»* (fermented rice wine), *«斗»* (dipper), and *«厚»* (thick). This confirms its ancient pronunciation.\n\nIn **Laozi’s** (老子) *«To endure a nation’s filth, one becomes its sovereign of soil and grain»* (受国之垢，是谓社稷主), *«垢»* (filth) and *«主»* (sovereign) rhyme.\n\nThe **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙碑本) does not divide chapters, containing **62 characters**.

(小答问)\n\nTherefore, those with **virtue/power** (有德) oversee the tablets, while those without oversee the **penetrating/withdrawing** (彻).\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: *«Therefore»* (故) is omitted in the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) editions.\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙本), **Yùzhù** (御注), and **Dūnhuáng Xīn edition** (敦煌辛本) all include *«故»* (therefore) at the beginning of the sentence.\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) adds: The **Dūn** (敦), **Suì** (遂), and **Jìng** (景) editions all include *«故»* (therefore) at the start of the sentence.\n*«彻»* (penetrating) is written as *«撤»* (withdraw) in the **Dūn edition** (敦本), *«辙»* (tracks) in the **Suì edition** (遂本).\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: The **Yán’s edition** (严本) also reads *«辙»* (tracks).\nThough *«彻»* (penetrating) and *«辙»* (tracks) were interchangeably used in ancient times, *«彻»* (penetrating) is more appropriate here.\n**Yú Yì** (俞樾) states: *«As for ancient characters, 『彻』 (chè) and 『辙』 (zhé) were used interchangeably. In Chapter Twenty-Seven, 『善行无辙迹』 (good deeds leave no tracks or traces), the **Shìwén** (释文) reads 『彻』 (chè), citing **Liáng’s annotation** (梁注): 『彻 (chè) should be on the side of a carriage (应车边), but today it is written as 『彳』 (zhì), as ancient characters were often simplified.*»\n\n「Then this passage’s 『彻』 (chè) likewise aligns with that usage.\n『有德司契，无德司辙』 (Those with virtue oversee the *contracts*; those without oversee the *tracks*)—meaning virtuous rulers merely hold the left *contract* and matching *tokens* to confirm trust, while unvirtuous rulers anxiously scrutinize their *tracks* and traces.\n\nThe **Héshànggōng** (河上公) commentary on 『善行无辙迹』 (Good deeds leave no tracks) states:\n『Those who practice the Dao seek it within themselves—never descending the hall, never stepping beyond the gate—and thus leave no tracks.』\nThis clarifies the meaning of 『无德司彻』 (Those without virtue oversee *stripping*).\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: Yú’s interpretation is incorrect. 『彻』 (chè) should be glossed as *to strip* or *exploit*.\nThe *tracks* beside a *cart* (车辙) does not fit the meaning here.\n\n**Dàtián Qíngxuān** (大田晴轩) says:\n『The scholars variously interpret 『彻』 as *permeating*, *illuminating*, or the *chè* in *chèfǎ* (彻法), but none grasp what this chapter truly addresses—thus their conflicting, erroneous theories, like a chaotic marketplace.\n『彻』 means *to strip* or *exploit*. In the *Fēng* ode 『Píxiāo』 (豳风·鸱鸮), it says 『彻彼桑土，绸缪牖户』 (Strip the mulberry soil, mend the lattice doors), with the *Máo* commentary: 『彻, to strip.』\nIn the *Xiao Ya* 『Shíyuè zhījiāo』 (小雅·十月之交), it says 『彻我墙屋，田卒污莱』 (Strip my walls and houses, the fields lie fallow and overgrown).\nVirtuous rulers prioritize harmonizing the people’s will, so they take nothing from them; unvirtuous rulers disregard the people’s sentiments, thus only digging and stripping become their concern.』\n\nAnother view suggests 『彻』 may instead be *kill*.\n\n**Gāo Hēng** (高亨) states:\n『The seal script for 『彻』 (chè) is 『○』, while the ancient script for 『杀』 (shā) in the *Shuōwén* (说文) is also 『○』—their forms are similar. In *Lǎozǐ*, this character appears as 『○』, but later scribes misread it as 『彻』.\nIn Chapter Seventy-Four, it says 『常有司杀者杀，夫代司杀者杀，是谓代大匠斲』 (Those who habitually oversee killing will kill; those who substitute as overseers will kill—this is called substituting as the master carpenter’s axe).\nHere, 『司杀』 (overseeing killing) carries the same meaning.\nVirtuous rulers are benevolent and generous, hence 『司契』 (overseeing *contracts*); unvirtuous rulers are tyrannical and excessive in punishment, hence 『司杀』 (overseeing *killing*).\nThose who oversee *contracts* are the virtuous, whom Heaven blesses; those who oversee *killing* are the wicked, whom Heaven dooms.\nThus the following text states 『天道无亲，常与善人』 (The Dao of Heaven favors none, always aiding the virtuous)—a warning to rulers not to oversee *killing* but to oversee *contracts*.\nIn ancient rhyme, *contracts* (契) belonged to the *Tài* (泰) rhyme group, while *chè* (彻) belonged to the *Zhī* (脂) group—*contracts* and *chè* were thus phonetically associated.\n*Kill* (杀) also belonged to the *Tài* (泰) group, so *contracts* and *kill* share the same rhyme.』\n\nThe *Tàiyán* (泰言) commentary states: These two lines are ancient words, found in *Shuōyuàn* (說苑, *Sayings from the Hall*)’s *Jìngshèn* (敬慎, *Respect and Caution*) chapter quoting the inscription on the **Yellow Emperor’s Golden Man**, and also in the *Annotations to the Biography of Yuan Shao* in the *History of the Later Han*, cited as the words of **Duke of Zhou’s Golden Repository**.\n\nAgain, **Lang Ji** (郎颀) in his transmission of *Ji* (易, *The Book of Changes*) says: *\"The Dao of Heaven favors none, always aiding the virtuous.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn Jiang’s (江氏) rhyme readings for this chapter:\n- *Yuàn* (怨, *grudge*) and *yuàn* (怨, *grudge*) share the *Shàn* (善, *virtue*) rhyme (from the *Yuàn* 部, *Yuan* group),\n- *Qì* (契, *contract*) and *chè* (彻, *pierce*, pronounced *jié* 如挈) share the *Jì* (祭, *sacrifice*) rhyme,\n- *Qīn* (亲, *near*) and *rén* (人, *person*) share the *Zhēn* (真, *true*) rhyme.\n**Yáo Wéndiàn** (姚文田) and **Xí Zòng** (奚侗) concur.\n**Takuchi Kaoru** (武内义雄) and **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) read: *Yuàn* (怨), *yuàn* (怨), *shàn* (善), *rén* (人) in rhyme.\nThus, *Yuàn* (怨), *yuàn* (怨), *shàn* (善) belong to the *Yuan* (元) group, and *rén* (人, *person*) to the *Zhēn* (真, *true*) group—these two groups were phonetically associated in ancient rhyme.\n\n**Gǔ Yīnmù** (顾炎武) in his *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正, *Correct Rhymes of the Tang Dynasty*), Volume 17, Section 17, *Xué* (薛, *shoe*): *\"Zhé\"* (辙, *track*), when pronounced in the *Qù* (去, *departing*) tone, follows the *Zhí* (直, *straight*) rhyme category.\n**Lǎozi** (老子) states: *\"Those with virtue oversee *contracts*, those without oversee *killing*.\"* Some manuscripts read *\"chè\"* (彻).\n**Lǐ Qìnyún** (李赓芸) in his *Bǐngzhú biān* (炳烛编, *Illuminated Candle Notes*), Volume 3, says of the *Lǎozi* (老子) chapter *\"Rènqì\"* (任契, *Entrusting Contracts*): *\"Those with virtue oversee *contracts*, those without oversee *chè* (彻).\"*\nThis aligns with the rhyme of *qì* (契) and *chè* (彻).\n\nThe *Guǎngyùn* (广韵) places *\"qì\"* (契) in the *Xiè* (屑, *shavings*) group (16) and *\"chè\"* (彻) in the *Xué* (薛, *shoe*) group (17), indicating that *Xiè* (屑) and *Xué* (薛) were phonetically interchangeable.\n**Jiāng Yǒuguì** (江有诰) in *Tángyùn sìshēng zhèng* (唐韵四声正, *Correct Four-Tone Rhymes of the Tang Dynasty*), Section 28, *Xiè* (狝, *wild*): *\"Shàn\"* (善, *virtue*), pronounced as *Cháng yǎn* (常演, *constant display*)—this was originally a *píng* (平, *level*) tone, merged with the *Xiān* (仙, *immortal*) group.\n\nIn the *Xìnyuè* (信契, *Faithful Contracts*) chapter of *Lǎozi*, it reads *\"How can one be virtuous?\"* (安可以为善), which rhymes with *yuàn* (音冤, *grudge*).\n\nThe **Jìnglóng bēi** (景龙碑) manuscript divides the chapter ambiguously—after the line *\"Those without oversee *chè* (彻)\"*, there is an empty space, suggesting a break, making it forty characters. The **Dùnjiāng** (敦煌), **Héshàng** (河上), and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts agree, while the **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts have forty-one characters.\nThe **Héshàng** (河上) manuscript titles it *\"Rènqì\"* (任契, *Entrusting Contracts*), the **79th Chapter**.\nThe **Wáng** (王) manuscript titles it *\"Chapter 79\"*.\nThe **Fàn** (范) manuscript titles it *\"Harmonizing Great Grudges\"* (和大怨, *Harmonizing Great Grudges*), the **79th Chapter**.\n\n**Chapter 80**\n*\"Small states, few people\"* (小国寡人),\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *\"Small states, few people\"* (小国寡人) is variously read as *\"few citizens\"* (寡民).\nUnder *\"shí bǎi\"* (什伯, *ten-hundred*), the **Héshàng** (河上) manuscript has *\"rén\"* (人, *people*) below *\"bǎi\"* (伯).\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: *\"Small states, few citizens\"* (小国寡民), the **Jìnglóng** (景龙) manuscript reads *\"rén\"* (人, *people*) instead of *\"mín\"* (民, *citizens*).\n*\"Though they possess ten-hundredfold arms\"* (使有什伯之器),\nThe **Dùnjiāng** (敦煌) manuscript, **Sīn** (辛) version reads: *\"Though the people possess ten-hundredfold arms\"* (使民有什伯之器),\nThe **Gǔ** (顾) manuscript reads: *\"Though the people possess myriad-hundredfold arms\"* (使人有仟伯人之器).\n**Qiānzhī** (谦之) commentary: The **Suìzhōu** (遂州) manuscript agrees with *\"小国寡人\"* (小国寡人).\nThe **Nǎi** (柰) manuscript reads *\"liáo\"* (寮, *shed*) instead of *\"guǎ\"* (寡, *few*).\nBelow the first line, **Yán** (严), **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), **Fàn** (范), and **Zhào** (赵) manuscripts have *\"mín\"* (民, *citizens*) below *\"shǐ\"* (使, *make*).\nThe **Jìngfú** (景福), **Nǎi** (柰), and **Wáng Xīzhī** (王羲之) manuscripts have *\"rén\"* (人, *people*) below *\"bǎi\"* (伯).\nThe **Gǔ** (顾) manuscript has *\"mín\"* (民, *citizens*) below *\"bǎi\"* (伯).\nThe **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts have *\"yě\"* (也, *also*) below *\"yòng\"* (用, *use*).\n**Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) says: *\"Though they possess ten-hundredfold arms and do not use them\"* (使有什伯之器而不用) is sometimes read as *\"order the arms\"* (令器) or *\"do not use\"* (不用), but both are incorrect.\n**Yú Zè** (俞樾) notes: *\"什伯之器\"* (什伯之器) refers to military arms.\nThe *Annotations to the Biography of Xuān Bǐng* (后汉书宣秉传注) state: *\"Military law: five men form a *wǔ* (伍), two *wǔ* make a *shí* (什), and ten *wǔ* make a *bǎi* (伯).

The *Jiǔ Jīng Zìyàng* states: *\"The versions writing '邻' (*lín*) are erroneous; it should be written as '邻' (*lín*).\"*\n\n**Qiānzhī** commentary: The *Zhuangzi* in *\"Tú Gē\"* (*Túgē*, \"Opening the Coffers\") discusses *\"至德之世\"* (*zhìdé zhī shì*, \"the age of utmost virtue\"), and in *\"Mǎtí\"* (*Mǎtí*, \"Horses’ Hooves\") states *\"民有常性，织而衣，耕而食\"* (*mín yǒu chángxìng, zhī ér yī, gēng ér shí*, \"the people have inherent nature, they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves\"), both passages drawing from this chapter. The nine sentences cited in *\"Tú Gē\"* differ only in that *\"安其居，乐其俗\"* (*ān qí jū, lè qí sú*, \"secure their dwellings, joy in their customs\") are inverted.\n\nFurther, the *Huáinán Zǐ* in *\"Qí Sú\"* (*Qísú*, \"On the Customs of Equality\") states: *\"Thus neighboring states are visible to one another, the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard, yet their footprints do not cross the borders of the lords, and their wheel tracks do not join at a thousand *lǐ* (miles) away—all find their proper place.\"* The *Lùnliáng* in *\"Shuō Rì\"* (*Shuōrì*, \"Discussing the Sun\") states: *\"In ancient times, simplicity prevailed, neighboring states bordered each other, the sounds of roosters and dogs were heard, yet they did not visit one another throughout their lives.\"* Both passages derive from this chapter of *Laozi*. The *Shǐjì* in *\"Huòshī\"* (*Huòshī*, \"On the Monopolies of Commerce\") also contains *\"至治之极\"* (*zhìdào zhī jí*, \"at the utmost limit of good governance\"). Though the stele versions lack this sentence, it may be supplemented based on the *Fù* and *Fàn* versions and the citations in *Zhuangzi* and *Shǐjì*.\n\n---\n**【Rhymes】** This chapter, as per *Jiāng Shì*’s rhyming readings, lacks rhyme. *Yáo Wéntián* and *Dèng Tíngzhēn* agree. *Gāo Běn Hàn* renders it as *\"至治之极，民各甘其食，美其服，安其俗，乐其业\"* (*zhìdào zhī jí, mín gè gān qí shí, měi qí fú, ān qí sú, lè qí yè*), with *\"极\"* (*jí*), *\"食\"* (*shí*), *\"服\"* (*fú*), *\"俗\"* (*sú*), and *\"业\"* (*yè*) rhyming—though *\"俗\"* (*sú*) does not actually rhyme. Further, *\"邻国相望\"* (*lín guó xiāng wàng*) to *\"老死不相往来\"* (*lǎo sǐ bù xiāng wànglái*)—*Gāo Běn Hàn* incorrectly changes *\"往来\"* (*wànglái*) to *\"来往\"* (*láiwàng*), to harmonize with *\"望\"* (*wàng*), which is a grave error.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\n*\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise do not amass knowledge; those who amass knowledge are not wise.\"*\n\n**Luó Zhènyù** commentary: The *Dunhuang Xīn* version renders *\"知\"* (*zhī*) as *\"智\"* (*zhì*).\n\n**Takeshi Uchida** commentary: The *\"The virtuous do not argue\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn*) and *\"those who argue are not virtuous\"* (*biànzhě bù shàn*) passages appear after *\"The wise do not amass knowledge\"* (*zhìzhě bù bó*) and *\"those who amass knowledge are not wise\"* (*bózhě bù zhì*) in the *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* versions. **Qiānzhī** commentary: The *Yán* and *Gù* versions align with the *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* versions.\n\nThe *Fù* and *Fàn* versions render *\"善者不辩\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn*) and *\"辩者不善\"* (*biànzhě bù shàn*) as *\"善言不辩\"* (*shàn yán bù biàn*) and *\"辩言不善\"* (*biàn yán bù shàn*), respectively.\n\n**Yú Zǎo** commentary: This should be read as *\"信者不美，美者不信\"* (*xìnzhě bù měi, měizhě bù xìn*, \"true words are not beautiful, beautiful words are not true\"), matching the parallel structure of the following *\"善者不辩，辩者不善；知者不博，博者不知\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn, biànzhě bù shàn; zhìzhě bù bó, bózhě bù zhì*).\n\n*Heshang Gong*’s commentary on *\"信者不美\"* (*xìnzhě bù měi*) states: *\"True words, as they are in reality. Not beautiful, meaning simple and unadorned.\"*\n\n「」This confirms that the ancient text should indeed read *\"xìnzhě bù měi\"* (信者不美), without the *\"yán\"* (言) character.\n\n**Táo Hóngqìng** remarked: *\"According to Yú Shì’s reliance on Heshang Gong’s annotation, the original text’s two instances of '言' should both be '者', aligning with the parallel structure below. Now, referring to Wáng Bì’s annotation, which states: 'Real and unadorned, rooted in simplicity,' he elucidates the meanings of '信' and '美' without addressing '言', implying his source text also used '者'.*\n\n**Qiānzhī** counters: *\"Yú and Táo’s argument is incorrect. In *Wénxīn Diāolóng*’s *Qíngcǎi* chapter, it states: 'Lǎozǐ detests falsity, thus declaring 『méi yán bù xìn』 (美言不信).' This proves Liú Xiè’s *Lǎozǐ* text included the '言' character. Heshang Gong’s annotation here reads: 'Excessively ornate speech, laboring over flowery words—untrue, embellished with deceit and emptiness.' Moreover, in *Chéng Xuànyīng’s* *Kāití Jùyì Yìshū*, this chapter is titled the 'Shìyán' (信言) chapter. The *shū* states: 'Shì (信) means reality; měi (美) means superficial brilliance. The speech of the virtuous—real yet unadorned... Superficial brilliance in speech... contradicts ultimate truth, hence untrue. Thus Zhuangzi says, 『Dogs are not good barkers for being virtuous; people are not virtuous for speaking well.』' This confirms Heshang Gong’s text and the stele edition are identical. Wáng Bì’s annotation on Chapter 62, *\"méi yán kěyǐ shì\"* (美言可以市), states: 'Ornate speech can deceive merchants, hence \"ornate speech can trade.\"' In this chapter, his annotation reads: 'Real and unadorned, rooted in simplicity.' The meaning is consistent. Though he does not mention '言', its implication is inherent—how can one assert his source text *must* have used '者'?\n\nAs for the *\"shànzhě bù biàn\"* (善者不辩) passage, **Jiāo Jùn** in *Kǎoyì* notes: 'The ancient text reads *\"shàn yán bù biàn, biàn yán bù shàn\"* (善言不辩，辩言不善).' Similarly, in *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Qíwùlùn*, it states *\"dà biàn bù yán\"* (大辩不言), echoing the same sentiment. The *\"bù zhī shēn yǐ, zhī zhī qiǎn yǐ\"* (不知深矣，知之浅矣) in *Běiyóu Piān* also parallels the *\"zhìzhě bù bó\"* (知者不博) passage in meaning.\n\n*'Shèngrén bù jī'* (圣人不积): *Yán Kějūn* notes that the *Yùzhù* renders this as *\"wú jī\"* (无积), while **Luó Zhènyù** observes that the *Yùzhù*, *Jǐngfú*, and other versions use *\"yǔ\"* (与) instead of *\"wéi\"* (为). **Qiānzhī** confirms that *Xíng Xuán*, *Qìngyáng*, *Pánxī*, and *Lóuzhèng* all use *\"yǔ\"* (与). The two *\"yù\"* (愈) characters are rendered as *\"yú\"* (逾) by *Xíng Xuán*, while *Fàn* uses *\"yú\"* (俞)—an ancient character mistakenly written as *\"yú\"* (逾). The stele edition’s Chapter 5 also uses *\"yú\"* (俞). Additionally, *\"shèngrén bù jī\"* (圣人不积) is rendered as *\"wú jī\"* (无积) in *Yán*, *Péng*, *Fù*, *Zhào*, and *Gāo* versions, while *Heshang Gong* and *Wáng Bì* use *\"bù jī\"* (不积). The correct form is *\"wú jī\"* (无积). The *Zhàn guó cè*’s *Wèi cè* quotes Lǎozǐ as saying: *\"Shèngrén wú jī, jìn wéi rén jǐ yù yǒu, jì yǐ yǔ rén jǐ yù duō\"* (圣人无积，尽以为人己愈有，既以与人己愈多), where *\"bù jī\"* (不积) is also rendered as *\"wú jī\"* (无积). The *\"jì yǐ yǔ rén\"* (既以与人) sentence is identical to *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Tiánzǐfāng Piān*. The *\"jìn wéi rén\"* (尽以为人) sentence’s *\"jìn\"* (尽) can be emended to *\"jì\"* (既) based on *Wèicè*, forming a parallel structure.\n\nMoreover, *\"jī\"* (积) carries the meaning of 'to hoard.' In *Chǔyǔ*, *\"wú yīrì zhī jī\"* (无一日之积) is annotated as *\"jī\"* (积) meaning 'to store.' In *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Tiāndào*, *\"yùn ér wú suǒ jī\"* (运而无所积) is annotated in the *Shìwén*: 'Referring to stagnation and blockage.' In *Tiānxià Piān*, it states of Lǎodān: *\"yǐ yǒu jī wéi bùzú... wú cáng yě gù yǒuyú\"* (以有积为不足... 无藏也故有余), meaning 'not hoarding thus having abundance.' The Dao of Heaven profits without harming; the Dao of the Sage acts without contention.\n\nLu Zhenyu remarked: *\"The Dunhuang Sima manuscript lacks the lower ‘zhi’ (之) character.\"* Qian’s annotation: *\"The Zhao manuscript reads ‘rén zhī dào’ (人之道), omitting the ‘shèng’ (圣) character.\"* The **‘rén’ (人)** corresponds to **‘tiān’ (天)**, forming a parallel structure—this is more harmonious in composition (*wén shèng*), yet it does not reflect the original meaning of Laozi.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang’s rhyme reading, lacks rhyme, while all other versions agree. Only Gao’s Han manuscript rhymes **xìn (信)** with **shàn (善)**, and Takeuchi Yoshio rhymes **jī (积)**, **yǒu (有)**, and **duō (多)**, both of which are incorrect. This chapter actually rhymes **xìn-xìn (信信)**, **shàn-shàn (善善)**, **zhī-zhī (知知)** in a head-to-tail pattern.\n\nMoreover, **zhī (知)**, **jī (积)**, and **duō (多)** share a rhyme, with **zhī (知)** and **jī (积)** belonging to the **Zhī (支)** rhyme category, while **duō (多)** belongs to the **Gē (歌)** category—here, **Gē (歌)** and **Zhī (支)** are interchangeable in rhyme.\n\nThe **Jǐnglóng Stele** manuscript contains **57 characters**, while the Dunhuang, Hé, Wáng, Fù, and Fàn manuscripts all match it. The Hé manuscript is titled *“Xiǎnzhí Dìbāshíyī” (显质第八十一)*, the Wáng manuscript *“Bāshíyī Zhāng” (八十一章)*, and the Fàn manuscript *“Xìn yán bù měi Zhāng dì bāshíyī” (信言不美章第八十一)*.\n\n**Appendix: Laozi’s Rhyme Patterns**\n\nIn ancient times, Kong Guangsen composed *Poetic Sound Categories*, stating:\n\n*\"Nowadays, poetry prioritizes literary elegance, whereas ancient poetry prioritized song. Song has rhythms of haste and slowness, harmonies of clarity and turbidity—sometimes unfolding in lengthy recitation, sighing and chanting across multiple lines without strict rhyme; sometimes binding sound to tight rhythms, where each sentence rhymes, each character rhymes, yet never tiring of it.\"*\n\nI hold that the *Five Thousand Words* of *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* is ancient philosophical poetry. Since it is poetry, it must be singable, recitable—its rhythms of haste and slowness, its harmonies of clarity and turbidity, though not necessarily identical to the *Three Hundred Poems*, yet whether or not it rhymes, it surely adheres to poetic conventions without doubt.\n\nHowever, in the Song dynasty’s *Wu Qi’s Rhyme Supplement*, it was already lamented that *\"Laozi’s Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic, composed by Old Master Laozi beneath the Zhou dynasty’s ancestral hall, contains many rhymed passages, yet today they are often mispronounced.\"* Thus, establishing principles and examples—how can they be neglected? I now compose *Laozi’s Rhyme Patterns*.\n\n**(1)** Times change, sounds diverge—each era has its own phonetic system. Ancient rhymes cannot align with Tang, nor Tang rhymes with today. As Yan Bai’s poem states, *\"The sounds of past and present are bound to their times\"*—how true this is! Reading the *Five Thousand Words* with modern pronunciation feels discordant, yet applying ancient pronunciation reveals many alignments, with discrepancies often arising from scribal errors. In the past, Deng Tingzhen examined the rhymes in the *Five Thousand Words*, aligning them with the *Book of Changes* and *Book of Poetry*. For instance, in the chapter *\"Discerning Virtue/Power\"*, *fù (富)*, *zhì (志)*, and *jiǔ (久)* form a single rhyme—*jiǔ* rhyming with *fù* and *zhì* matches the *Book of Poetry*, while the following sentence rhymes with *shòu (寿)*, aligning with the *Book of Changes*. In truth, the *Five Thousand Words* sometimes aligns with the *Book of Poetry*, sometimes diverges, yet with the *Book of Changes*, it is nearly identical. Moreover, since Chu people wrote in Chu dialect with Chu pronunciation, this also marks the beginning of *Sao* rhyme. Let me cite examples where it aligns with the *Book of Changes*:\n\n**(1)** Chapter 5: *\"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion; better to guard the center.\"* *Qióng (穷)* and *zhōng (中)* rhyme.\n   - *Book of Changes*’ *Need* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)* rhyme.\n   - *Obstruction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *gōng (功)*, *bāng (邦)* rhyme.\n   - *Misfortune* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Well* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)*, *xiōng (凶)* rhyme.\n   - *Progress* commentary: *gōng (功)*, *bāng (邦)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Dispersion* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *tóng (同)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)* rhyme.\n   - *Restriction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Completion* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Earth* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (终)* rhyme.\n   - *Following* commentary: *xiōng (凶)*, *gōng (功)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Great Strength* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)* rhyme.\n   - *Restriction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Wind* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *xiōng (凶)* rhyme.\n\n**(2)** Chapter 24: *\"The ambitious falter soon;

Knowing the **Dao/Way of Sound** (声音之道), it shifts with the times yet aligns with *Book of Changes* and *Chu Ci*, and upon examination, all are not far from **Laozi** (老子). The *Five Thousand Words* (五千言) is indeed one of the two great **philosophical poems** (哲学诗) of ancient China alongside *Book of Changes* (易经); **Laozi** being a native of Chu (楚人), it also harmonizes with the **Chu melodies** (楚声). Though **Laozi** is traditionally placed after **Qu Yuan** (屈) in historical order, the frequency of the particle **\"xiē\"** (兮) in the text suggests a close affinity with *Chu Ci*’s rhymes—could the *Five Thousand Words* be the **progenitor of Chu melodies** (楚声之元祖)?\n\n**(Part II)** Research on **Laozi**’s ancient rhymes began with **Song dynasty Wu Ji** (宋吴棫). Following **Metaphorical Firewood** (顾炎武) and **Jiang Shenxiu** (江慎修) in the **Qing dynasty**, the most notable works are **Jiang Jinsan**’s (江晋三) *Laozi* rhyme readings, **Yao Wentian**’s (姚文田) *Harmony of Ancient Sounds*, and **Deng Tingzhen**’s (邓廷桢) *Notes from the Double Inkstone Studio* (双砚斋笔记). **Deng**’s work uniquely clarifies the boundaries between the **Yu** (虞) and **Hou** (侯) tonal categories, and the classification of **entering tones** (入声) under various departments, yet it does not delve into a comprehensive study of ancient rhymes.\n\n**Jiang Jinsan** (江晋三) presents a **twenty-department harmony** (廿一部谐声), while **Yao Wentian** (姚文田) organizes **twenty-eight ancient rhyme departments** (古韵廿八部), meticulously cross-referencing each line and word in the *Five Thousand Words* (五千言) to elucidate rhyme principles. Though some omissions exist, their deviations are few. Particularly, **Jiang Jinsan**’s rhyme readings align with **Wang Renxun**’s (王念孙) *Ancient Rhyme Chart* (古韵谱), providing scholars with valuable resources. The following is an attempt to compare and arrange them (with the numbers in the table corresponding to **Laozi**’s chapter sequence):\n\nJiang Jinsan’s *Twenty-Department Harmony* (廿一部谐声) and Yao Wentian’s *Twenty-Eight Ancient Rhyme Departments* (古韵廿八部) reveal the following rhyme patterns in **Laozi**’s *Five Thousand Words* (五千言), with numbers corresponding to chapter

**21** (缉、合、盍、叶帖、洽、狎、业、乏)\n\n**(Section III)** A meticulous examination of Jiang Shi’s *Laozi* rhyme readings reveals his most significant divergence from Yao Wenti’s approach: Jiang takes the *Five Thousand Words* as a rhymed text and elucidates the principles of **through-rhymes (通韵)** and **combined rhymes (合韵)**. For instance, in Chapter 41, where *gǔ* (谷), *rǔ* (辱), *zú* (足), *tōu* (偷), *yú* (渝), and *yú* (隅) all belong to the *Hóu* (侯) rhyme category, Yao Wenti and Deng Tingzhen split them into two—*gǔ, rǔ, zú* in one (sixth *Wū* entering-tone), and *tōu, yú* in another (thirteenth *Hóu* level-tone). Jiang, however, rejects this erroneous entering-tone division, treating all six as a single rhyme.\n\nThis is but one example of harmonizing within the same rhyme class; yet when it comes to **cross-rhyme transformations (通转)** between different classes, only those with exquisite phonetic discernment dare speak of it. For example, in Chapter 67, *yǒng* (勇), *guǎng* (广), and *zhǎng* (长) form a **Yang-Dong through-rhyme**, yet Yao Wenti and Deng Tingzhen only acknowledge *guǎng* and *zhǎng*. In Chapter 2, *shì* (事), *jiào* (教), *cí* (辞), *yǒu* (有), and *shì* (恃) belong to the **Zhī-Xiāo combined rhyme**, but Yao and Deng only recognize *cí, yǒu, shì*. Even more complex are cases like Chapter 64, where *sǎn* (散), *luàn* (乱), and *mò* (末) form a **Zhì-Yuán through-rhyme**, or Chapter 35, where *wèi* (味), *jiàn* (见), and *jì* (既) form a **Zhī-Yuán combined rhyme**—these require mastery of **yin-yang opposing transformations (阴阳对转)** to comprehend.\n\nWhen examining *Laozi*’s through-rhymes and combined rhymes, Jiang’s discoveries reveal the following patterns:\n\n**Through-Rhymes (通韵):**\n1. **Zhī-Yōu** (之、幽) (Chapters 9, 16, 25, 52, 33, 50, 59)\n2. **Yōu-Xiāo** (幽、宵) (Chapter 41)\n3. **Hóu-Yú** (侯、鱼) (Chapters 26, 30, 34)\n4. **Gē-Zhī** (歌、支) (Chapters 10, 28)\n5. **Zhī-Zhì** (脂、祭) (Chapter 45)\n6. **Zhì-Yuán** (祭、元) (Chapter 64)\n7. **Yuán-Zhēn** (元、真) (Chapter 30)\n8. **Wén-Zhēn** (文、真) (Chapters 1, 15, 26)\n9. **Zhēn-Gēng** (真、耕) (Chapters 22, 32)\n10. **Yáng-Dōng** (阳、东) (Chapters 12, 16, 22, 25, 26, 67)\n\n**Combined Rhymes (合韵):**\n1. **Zhī-Xiāo** (之、宵) (Chapter 2)\n2. **Yōu-Hóu** (幽、侯) (Chapter 17)\n3. **Zhī-Yuán** (脂、元) (Chapter 35)\n\nAmong these, **\"Zhī-Yōu,\" \"Hóu-Yú,\" \"Zhī-Zhì,\" \"Zhēn-Gēng,\" and \"Wén-Zhēn\"** are instances of **adjacent-class transformations (近旁通转)**. Specifically:\n- **\"Zhī-Yōu,\" \"Hóu-Yú,\" \"Zhī-Zhì\"** are **yin-tone adjacent transformations (阴声近旁转)**.\n- **\"Zhēn-Gēng,\" \"Wén-Zhēn,\" \"Yáng-Dōng\"** are **yang-tone adjacent transformations (阳声近旁转)**.\n- **\"Zhī-Xiāo,\" \"Yōu-Hóu\"** are **yin-tone adjacent combined rhymes (阴声近旁合)**.\n\nNext, **\"Yuán-Zhēn\" and \"Yōu-Xiāo\"** are **secondary adjacent transformations (次旁通转)**—**\"Yuán-Zhēn\"** being **yang-tone secondary (阳声次旁转)**, and **\"Yōu-Xiāo\"** being **yin-tone secondary (阴声次旁转)**.\n**\"Gē-Zhī\"** is a **further secondary yin-tone transformation (阴声又次旁转)**, while **\"Zhì-Yuán\"** is a **yin-yang opposing secondary through-rhyme (阴阳相对之次通转)**, and **\"Zhī-Yuán\"** is a **yin-yang opposing secondary combined rhyme (阴阳相对之又次对合)**.\n\nIf we were to illustrate these patterns following Kong Guangsen’s and Zhang Binglin’s theories, a diagram as described above would clarify them.\n\n**(Section IV)** The *Five Thousand Words* of *Laozi* exhibits varied pacing, length, and rhyme structures: some passages employ rhyme throughout; others rhyme only at the chapter’s beginning, while the middle or end remains unrestricted; still others insert interjections or rhetorical phrases that do not conform to rhyme schemes. This reflects what may be called **\"free-rhyming\"**—a hallmark of **philosophical poetry**.\n\nIn terms of rhyme structure, some verses mirror the *Shijing*’s strictness. For example, Chapter 28:\n*\"Know its masculine, hold to its feminine—*\n*Thus you become the valley of the world.*\n*Be the valley of the world,*\n*Constant virtue never departs,*\n*And returns to the infant state.\"* **(Gē-Zhī through-rhyme)**\n\n*\"Know its bright, hold to its dark—*\n*Thus you become the model of the world.*\n*Be the model of the world,*\n*Constant virtue never errs,*\n*And returns to the boundless.\"* **(Zhī rhyme)**\n\n*\"Know its honor, hold to its disgrace—*\n*Thus you become the valley of the world.*\n*Be the valley of the world,*\n*Constant virtue attains sufficiency,*\n*And returns to the Primordial.\"* **(Hóu rhyme)**\n\nOr Chapter 10:\n*\"Nurture the vital essence, embrace the One—*\n*How could it ever stray?*\n*Concentrate the *qi*, attain softness—*\n*How could it ever be infantile?*\n*Purify the mystic vision—*\n*How could it ever be flawed?*\n*Love the people, govern the state—*\n*How could it ever act?*\n*The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—*\n*How could it ever be feminine?*\n*Illuminated, four-way—*\n*How could it ever know?\"* **(Gē-Zhī through-rhyme)**\n\nHere, the **one-stanza-three-refrains (一唱三叹)** technique—where sound echoes sound—would not seem out of place in the *Three Hundred Poems*. Yet the distinction remains: while the *Shijing* sings of human emotions, *Laozi* competes in **rational exposition**. The defining feature of **philosophical poetry** lies in its **content**; differing substance demands differing form. Thus, while *Laozi*’s rhyme schemes share similarities with poetry, they also diverge—and unlike the *Yijing*, they bear no fundamental difference.\n\nThe *Laozi*’s rhyme patterns and tables, as previously compiled by scholars, such as Liu Shipei’s *Laozi* rhyme table in the *Jingmai Guocui Xuebao* (1906), are largely speculative and unreliable.\n\nSten Jun’s preliminary *Laozi* rhyme study, published in the *Beijing Daxue Yanjiusuo Guoxue Men Zhoukan*, remains incomplete.\n\nThe following compilation lists **twenty-four instances** in total:\n\n**(1) Single-line rhyme shifts**\n*\"Which is closer, name or body?\"* (True rhyme)\n*\"Which is more abundant, body or wealth?\"* (Song rhyme)\n*\"Which brings greater harm, gain or loss?\"* (Yang rhyme)\n*\"Thus, excessive love brings great expenditure\"* (Zhi rhyme),\n*\"Excessive hoarding brings great loss\"* (Yang rhyme).\n*\"Contentment brings no disgrace\"* (Hou rhyme),\n*\"Knowing when to stop brings no peril\"*—\n*\"Thus one may endure long\"* (Zhi rhyme). **(Chapter 44)**\n\n*\"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves\"* (Song rhyme),\n*\"I love stillness, yet the people align themselves\"* (Geng rhyme),\n*\"I do no work, yet the people prosper\"* (Zhi rhyme),\n*\"I desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity\"* (Hou rhyme). **(Chapter 57)**\n\n**(2) Two-line rhyme shifts**\n\n「One need not leave home to know the world (Yu rhyme);\nOne need not peer through windows to see the Dao (You rhyme). **(Chapter 47)**\n\nWhen governance is serene and unobtrusive, the people are pure and sincere (Wen rhyme);\nWhen governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people grow weary and depleted (Jie rhyme). **(Chapter 58)**\n\n**(3) Three-line rhyme shifts**\nThe well-planted tree cannot be uprooted;\nThe well-embraced thing cannot slip away—\nThus descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing (Jie rhyme).\nCultivate the self, and its virtue becomes true (Zhen rhyme);\nCultivate the family, and its virtue abounds (Yu rhyme). **(Chapter 54)**\n\nTo dare boldly is to court death,\nTo dare not dare is to live—\nKnow this, for one or the other brings gain or harm (Jie rhyme).\nWhat Heaven abhors—who knows its reason?

martial,\nSkilled in war were not wrathful,\nSkilled in defeating enemies did not engage,\nSkilled in using people took the lower ground (Yu rhyme).\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThus they harnessed the people’s strength—\nThis is called aligning with Heaven’s ultimate (Zhi rhyme). **(Chapter 68)**\n\n**(5) Rhyme shifts of five lines or more**»\n\nFive colors blind the eyes,\nFive tones deaf the ears,\nFive flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping hunts drive the heart to madness,\nRare treasures bring misfortune upon one’s conduct (Yang/Dong rhyme).\nThus the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes (You rhyme),\nAnd so discards the latter for the former (Zhi rhyme). **(Chapter 12)**\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich becomes the Mother of the world.\nKnowing the Mother,\nOne also knows the Child;\nKnowing the Child,\nOne returns to guard the Mother—\nAnd thus avoids peril throughout life (Zhi rhyme).\nClose the orifice,\nShut the gate,\nAnd one will never labor through life (Yang rhyme);\nOpen the orifice,\nAnd the work will prosper,\nYet one will never be saved (Zhi/You rhyme).\nSeeing what is small is called clarity,\nHolding to softness is called strength.\nUsing its brilliance,\nReturning to its clarity,\nLeaving no harm to the body—\nThis is called following the constant (Yang rhyme). **(Chapter 52)**\n\n**(6) One rhyme per chapter**\n\nHold full to the brim, yet it will not last—\nBetter to leave it slightly wanting.\nSharpening the blade to its keenest edge,\nIt cannot long endure.\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nYet none can guard them well.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance—\nAnd so one invites one’s own ruin.\nWhen deed is done, name secured,\nWithdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven (Zhi/You rhyme). **(Chapter 9)**\n\nTo govern men, to serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses *shì* (proper measure).\nOnly through *shì* does one\nAttain what is called early virtue.\nEarly virtue is called the accumulation of virtue.\nAccumulate virtue greatly,\nAnd nothing will not be achieved.\nIf nothing is not achieved,\nThen none can know its limit.\nIf none can know its limit,\nOne may have a state.\nThe Mother of having a state,\nOne may endure long—\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundation,\nOf long life and enduring vision (Zhi/You rhyme). **(Chapter 59)**\n\n*(Seven) One chapter, multiple rhymes: Heavy as the root

with uncertainty (Yang rhyme). **(Chapter 41)**\n\nSome may hate it,\nThus, the one who follows the Dao/Way does not dwell upon it (Yu rhyme). **(Chapter 24)**\n\n---\n\nFrom the examples cited above, there are cases deemed by earlier scholars as lacking rhyme, yet they all naturally conform to rhyme. For instance, in rhyming through repetition, the *Laozi* provides many examples, and there are corroborations found in poetry and the *Yijing*. In poetry, the *Jiangqi* (Ch. 195) follows the *Zong* (Zong rhyme) in each stanza; the *Geqi* (Ch. 202) follows the *Qing* (Qing rhyme) in the first two stanzas; the *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Dian* (Dian rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Shengmin* (Ch. 203) follows the *Lin* (Lin rhyme) in its three stanzas; the *Zai* (Ch. 204) follows the *Shen* (Shen rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Qian* (Ch. 205) follows the *Kuang* (Kuang rhyme) in its first two stanzas; the *Heren* (Ch. 197) follows the *Xing* (Xing rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Qiaoyan* (Ch. 206) follows the *Sheng* (Sheng rhyme) in its two stanzas; the *Hongyan* (Ch. 207), *Yi* (Ch. 196), and *Sangrou* (Ch. 208) all follow the *Ren* (Ren rhyme); the *Mian* (Ch. 198) follows the *Men* (Men rhyme) in its seven stanzas; the *Dang* (Ch. 209) follows the *Shang* (Shang rhyme) in its stanzas beginning from the second, using the character \"商\" (Shang); the *Dongshan* (Ch. 210) follows the *Shan* (Shan rhyme) in each stanza, using the character \"山\" (Shan); the *Yu* (Ch. 199) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Qiaoyan* (Ch. 206) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Binzhi* (Ch. 211) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its first stanza; the *Cawei* (Ch. 212) follows the *He* (He rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Han* (Ch. 213) follows the *He* (He rhyme) in its three stanzas; the *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its ten stanzas; the *Chuche* (Ch. 214) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Xiangbo* (Ch. 215) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its seven stanzas; the *Nanshan* (Ch. 216) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its first, second, fourth, and fifth stanzas.\n\nOther examples include *Lai* (Ch. 217) with *lai* (Lai rhyme), *Guo* (Ch. 218) with *guo* (Guo rhyme), *Shu* (Ch. 219) with *shu* (Shu rhyme), *Nü* (Ch. 220) with *nü* (Nü rhyme), *Di* (Ch. 221) with *di* (Di rhyme), *Zui* (Ch. 222) with *zui* (Zui rhyme), *You* (Ch. 223) with *you* (You rhyme), *Le* (Ch. 224) with *le* (Le rhyme)—repetitive rhymes that are countless in number.\n\nAgain, taking the *Yijing* as an example, the *Yi* (Ch. 225) follows the *Yang* (Yang rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Da* (Ch. 226) follows the *Zhang* (Zhang rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Guan* (Ch. 227) follows the *Sheng* (Sheng rhyme) in its sixth line, ninth line, and upper ninth line; the *Jie* (Ch. 228) follows the *Ting* (Ting rhyme) in its initial ninth line and second line; the *Ding* (Ch. 229) follows the *Yuan* (Yuan rhyme) in its sixth line and upper ninth line; the *Bi* (Ch. 230) follows the *Wen* (Wen rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Xun* (Ch. 231) follows the *Rui* (Rui rhyme) in its fifth line; the *Sun* (Ch. 232) follows the *Shi* (Shi rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Xiao* (Ch. 233) follows the *Shi* (Shi rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Lun* (Ch. 234) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its sixth line; the *Yi* (Ch. 235) follows the *Hui* (Hui rhyme) in its sixth line and *Kun* (Ch. 236) follows the *Hui* (Hui rhyme) in its upper sixth line; the *Meng* (Ch. 237) follows the *Kou* (Kou rhyme) in its upper ninth line; the *Cui* (Ch. 238) follows the *Ju* (Ju rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Lü* (Ch. 239) follows the *Pu* (Pu rhyme) in its second and ninth lines; the *Dayu* (Ch. 240) follows the *Jiu* (Jiu rhyme) in its initial ninth line.\n\nThus, it is known that within the *Wuyingyan* (Five Thousand Words), rhymes like *Dao* (Dao rhyme), *Ming* (Ming rhyme), *Ren* (Ren rhyme), and even *Gou* (Gou rhyme) are hardly exceptional. Further, in the case of auxiliary rhymes, the *Yi* (Ch. 225) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Yu* (Yu rhyme) in its *Xiang* (Xiang rhyme) passage; the *Ding* (Ch. 229) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *You* (You rhyme) in its *Xiang* (Xiang rhyme) passage.\n\nEven if one claims the *Shijing* does not conform to auxiliary rhymes, this is not true. The *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its ten stanzas; the *Zai* (Ch. 204) follows the *You* (You rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Xiaozhong* (Ch. 241) follows the *Qi* (Qi rhyme) and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its two stanzas; the *Yuan* (Ch. 242) follows the *Zai* (Zai rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme), *Zai* (Zai rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme) in its one and two stanzas.\n\nAgain, in the *Chuci*, the *Lisha* (Ch. 243) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its \"心犹豫而狐疑，怀椒糈而要之\" (The heart is hesitant and dubious, holding fragrant rice and seeking it); \"命灵氛为余占之，孰信修而慕之\" (The spirit of the departed commands the ghost to divine for me, who would believe in virtue and emulate it); the *Tianwen* (Ch. 244) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Mou* (Mou rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *You* (You rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), and *Qi* (Qi rhyme); the *Jiuchapter* (Ch. 245) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *You* (You rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Aiying* (Ch. 246) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), the *Chi* (Ch. 247) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Qiou* (Qiu rhyme), the *Simeiren* (Ch. 248) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Xiwangri* (Ch. 249) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Yi* (Yi rhyme), *Ci* (Ci rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Jiubian* (Ch. 250) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its two and four instances.\n\nThus, it is known that within the *Wuyingyan*, examples of rhymes with two *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 74), three *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 23, 66, 80), four *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 17), and five *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 49) are hardly exceptional.\n\nSince *Laozi* is a Daoist poetic philosophy, its use of rhyme is more free than that of the *Shijing*. Yet even so, it truly conforms to rhyme. If one were to argue that his writing diverges or does not adhere to rhyme, not only would this fail to capture the resonant beauty of the *Wuyingyan*, but it would also be insufficient to discuss the texts of the other masters.\n\n**(1)** In terms of textual selection, this book primarily relies on the *Laozi* stele from the Tang dynasty’s Longxing Guan in Eizhou, supplemented by Dunhuang manuscripts and the Suizhou stele for cross-verification. For the stone editions, beyond the Imperial Commentary, *Guangming*, and *Jingfu* versions, it also draws on the editions of Lou Zheng, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panqi, Gao Yi, and Zhao Mengfu. For the manuscript copies, it references the *Nai* scroll and Sōtō-era manuscripts. For the printed *Wang* edition, besides the *Meiwa* edition by Ue no E, it also consults the Daoist Canon’s *Wang* edition, Fan Yingyuan’s citation of the *Wang* text, and the Song-era *Zhang Taishou* collated edition of the Four Commentaries. For the *He Shang* edition, in addition to the Song-printed version, it incorporates references from Li Daochun’s *Daode Jing Huiyuan*, which uses the plain-text chapter-and-commentary format. Additionally, ancient texts such as the *Fu-Fan* editions, the *Laozi* cited in Xia Jun’s *Guben Sishengyun*, and the falsely attributed Wang Xizhi calligraphic manuscripts are critically evaluated for inclusion.\n\n**(2)** In textual collation, this book primarily follows the 349 variant readings recorded in Yan Kejun’s *Tieqiao Jinshi Po* annotations of the Tang *Laozi*. Wei Jiaosun’s *Jiyutang* stele records either correct Yan’s errors or supplement his omissions, contributing 43 additional readings. Beyond these, it exhaustively gathers the collations of *Laozi* by Ji Yun, Bi Yan, Wang Chang, Wu Yun, as well as Luo Zhenyu’s *Daode Jing Kaoyi* and He Shiji’s *Guben Daode Jing Jiaokan*, ensuring all relevant stele-based corrections are scrutinized to distinguish authenticity from forgery, striving to restore the *Daode Jing* to its original form.\n\n**(3)** In exegesis, this book adopts the interpretations of Wang Renxun, Sun Yiran, Yu Ezhi, Hong Yixian, Liu Shipei, Yi Shunding, Ma Xulun, Tao Hongqing, Xi Dong, Jiang Xichang, Lao Jian, Gao Heng, and Yu Shengwu. It also occasionally incorporates the views of Japanese scholars Ōta Seikan and Takeuchi Yoshio. Marginal annotations are interspersed within the text, sometimes reflecting the author’s own insights, particularly emphasizing phonetic and tonal analysis, drawing on Zhu Jun’s *Shengwen Tongxun Ding Sheng*.\n\n**(4)** In phonology and rhyme, this book primarily follows Jiang Jin’s *Laozi* tonal readings. Where gaps exist, it supplements with Yao Wenti’s *Guyin Xie*, Deng Tingzhen’s *Shuangyan Zhai Biji*, and Li Qianyun’s *Bingzhu Bian*. Liu Shipei’s *Laozi Yunbiao*, Gao Benhan’s *Laozi Yunkao*, as well as Xi Dong and Chen Zhu’s reconstructions of *Laozi*’s ancient pronunciations are largely speculative; only plausible readings are retained, while untenable ones are discarded.\n\n**(5)** This book places particular emphasis on the relationship between Chu dialect and *Laozi*. For instance, in Chapter 45, *“zao sheng han”* (躁勝寒), it cites the *Shiji Fu* annotation that Chu people called fire *“zao”* (燥). In Chapter 55, *“zhong ri hao er bu sha”* (終日號而不嗄), it references Sima Biao’s note in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Gengsang Chu* chapter that Chu people termed extreme exhaustion without sound *“sha”* (嗄). In Chapter 70, *“pi he huai yu”* (披褐懷玉), it draws on the *Huainanzi*’s *Qisú* training annotation that Chu people called a short, coarse robe *“he”* (褐). Such examples are detailed in their respective chapters for the reader’s reference.\n\n**(6)** Upon completion of the initial manuscript, the author benefited greatly from multiple rounds of corrections by Yang Shuda and Ren Jiyu, as well as partial reviews by Liang Qichao and Wang Weicheng.\n\nThis work was revised multiple times based on the invaluable suggestions of these scholars, and any remaining errors are the sole responsibility of the author. Since Yang Shuda contributed the most—particularly as this was his final labor in his later years—this book is dedicated to his memory.\n\nMarch 1957\nZhu Qianzhi\n\n**Supplement**\n**Version Supplement**\n**(1)** Daoist *Dongxuan Jing* manuscript\n   A Dunhuang fragment, listed as No. 2584 in Paul Pelliot’s catalog (*Shindō Kichikaru, ed., Dunhuang Miyōki Ryūshin Shūhen* vol. 2).\n\n**(2)** Dunhuang Six Dynasties manuscript of *Laozi* with Zhang Daoling’s *Xiang’er Zhu* commentary (see *Laozi Xiang’er Zhu Jiaoqián Tú* [Hong Kong 1956 ed.], Plates 1–26, preserving the *Heshang* version from Chapter 3, *“Not seeing what is desired”* onward, through Chapter 37). Its content largely aligns with the Suizhou Longxing Stele edition, such as Chapter 3’s *“Not daring not to act,”* Chapter 7’s second *“shi”* (尸), Chapter 15’s *“Dissolving like ice about to melt,”* Chapter 16’s second *“sheng”* (生), Chapter 20’s *“My vital breath not yet manifest,”* and Chapter 24’s *“The panting one will not live long,”*—all likely belonging to the same textual tradition.\n\n**Bibliographical Supplement**\n**(1)** Kimura Hidekazu: *Laozi no Shin Kenkyū* (Shōwa 34, Sōbunsha).\n\n**(Bibliographical Supplement)**\n**(2)** Zhang Xiang’s *Annotations on the Laozi* (as preserved in the Dunhuang Six Dynasties manuscript): For Chapter 3, *“Not daring not to act”* (使心不乱), the annotation reads: *“According to Laozi’s Xiang’er Zhu commentary: In the *Huainanzi*’s ‘Training in the Dao,’ the *Shu Records*’s ‘Biography of Qin Mi,’ the *Kong Cangzi’s Commentary on the I Ching*’s *Gen Hexagram* (艮卦), the *Book of Jin*’s ‘Biography of Wu Yinzhī’ (吴隐之传), and the *Wenxuan*’s ‘Annotations on the *Dongjing Fu*’ (东京赋注), the text reads ‘*Not seeing what is desired*’ (不见可欲) without the character *民* (min). Liu Shipei’s *Laozi Rectified and Supplemented* argues that the Tang dynasty deleted this character due to taboo avoidance, but since the present Six Dynasties manuscript lacks the *民* character, Liu’s claim proves erroneous.”\n\nFor *“Empty its heart”* (虚其心), the annotation reads: *“In the Xiang’er Zhu commentary, ‘*虚*’ is written as ‘*○*’ (a blank). Based on the annotation’s text, ‘*Emptying the heart removes its wickedness, and the Dao returns to it*’ (虚去心中凶恶，道来归之), it is clear that the original should also read ‘*虚*’ (empty), and ‘*○*’ is a mistaken character.”*\n\nFor Chapter 7, *“With its lack of selfishness, it can fulfill its selfishness”* (以其无私，故能成其私), the annotation reads: *“The Xiang’er Zhu commentary renders this ‘*以其无尸，故能成其尸*’ (With its lack of *shi* [尸], it can fulfill its *shi* [尸]), and annotates: ‘*Those who do not know the Dao of longevity move only as corpses (尸行), not in accordance with the Dao. All their actions are corpse-like (尸行). The Daoist, however, attains immortal longevity by not moving as a corpse (尸行), by separating from the vulgar and differing from the common, thus fulfilling their *shi* (尸) and becoming an immortal sage (仙士).*’ This is the discourse of the *shenxian* (神仙) sect, which may be cross-referenced with the *Hou Hanshu*’s ‘Biography of the Magicians’ (后汉书方术传), and does not belong to the original *Laozi* text.”*\n\nFor Chapter 8, *“Now, only...”* (夫唯).\n\n「谦之案」: *\"The annotation reads: ‘*夫唯*’ is a sentence-initiating particle. It also appears in Chapter 15, 22, 59, 70, 71, 72, and 75, likely reflecting Chu dialect syntax.*\n\n**Chapter 9**\n*Hold it and it will overflow.*\n谦之案: *\"The *Guanzi* ‘White Heart’ chapter states: ‘*Hold it until it is full, and then disaster will come. To have one’s name spread across the land is not as good as letting it fade away.*’ This warning against excess aligns with *Laozi*’s teaching.*\n\n**Chapter 14**\n*Above, not dazzling; below, not obscure.*\n谦之案: *\"‘*皦*’ is rendered as ‘*皎*’ in the *Dunhuang Bing* manuscript. ‘*昧*’ appears as ‘*忽*’ in the *Suizhou* edition, the *Dunhuang* Daoist *Suo Dunxuanjing* manuscript, and the *Laozi Xiang’er Zhu* text.

      "translated_text": "**Laozi Textual Collation and Annotation by Zhu Qianzhi**\n\n**Preface to the Tang Dynasty Yizhou Longxingguan Stele Edition of the *Daodejing***\n\nQian Daxin remarked: According to the commentary of Heshang Gong, the text beginning with \"The Dao that can be spoken\" constitutes the *Dao Jing* (Book of the Way), Volume One, while the text beginning with \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous\" constitutes the *De Jing* (Book of Virtue/Power), Volume Two. Chao Yuezhi’s postscript to Wang Bi’s commentary states that Wang did not divide the text into *Dao* and *De* sections, thus preserving an ancient convention. However, Lu Deming’s *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations* (*Jingdian Shiwen*) explicitly follows Fu Si’s (Wang Bi’s) edition, titling it \"Dao Jing, Volume One\" and \"De Jing, Volume Two,\" identical to Heshang Gong’s arrangement. Chao’s claim of antiquity likely stems from a Song dynasty transcription, lacking proper verification.\n\nAmong the five stele editions of the *Daodejing* in my collection, only the Emperor Minghuang’s imperial commentary and this edition divide the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*, a structure consistent with Han and Wei dynasty editions. This stele, carved in the early Tang, contains numerous variant characters distinct from other versions. For instance:\n- \"無\" (wú) is written as \"无\" (wú),\n- \"愈\" (yù) as \"俞\" (yú),\n- \"芸\" (yún) as \"云\" (yún),\n- \"譽\" (yù) as \"豫\" (yù),\n- \"荒\" (huāng) as \"忙\" (máng),\n- \"佐\" (zuǒ) as \"作\" (zuò),\n- \"\" (xī) as \"翕\" (xī),\n\nall adhering to ancient script forms.\n\nFurther examples include:\n- Where other editions read \"故能蔽不新成\" (*hence it can obscure and not renew*), the stele reads \"能蔽復成\" (*can obscure and renew*).\n- After \"Where the army has camped, brambles grow,\" the stele omits the lines \"After a great war, there must be famine years.\"\n- After \"The supreme general stands on the right,\" the stele omits \"This is to position him according to funeral rites.\"\n- The passage \"Only by recognizing illness as illness does one avoid illness; the sage is not ill because he recognizes illness as illness, thus avoiding illness\" appears on the stele simply as: \"Thus the sage is not ill, for he recognizes illness as illness, and so avoids illness.\"\n\nSuch variants far surpass other editions. These few examples suffice to demonstrate the value of ancient steles.\n\nWu Yi stated: The division of the *Laozi* into *Dao Jing* (Volume One) and *De Jing* (Volume Two) aligns with ancient editions. Later, Lu You (Fangweng) noted in his postscript: \"Chao claimed that Wang Bi’s *Laozi* did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower sections, preserving an ancient form. Yet this edition has long since been divided.\" Thus, even by the Song dynasty, Wang Bi’s definitive edition was already lost.\n\nThe *Lunyu Shu* (Commentary on the *Analects*) by Xing Bing cites the *De Jing*: \"The net of heaven is vast; though its mesh is wide, nothing escapes.\" This serves as one piece of evidence.\n\nExamining the *Hanshu* (Book of Han) annotations:\n- Yan Shigu, in the *Biography of Wei Bao*, quotes the *Dao Jing*: \"In a state of chaos and confusion, loyal ministers emerge.\"\n- In the *Biography of Tian Heng*, he cites the *De Jing*: \"Nobility takes humility as its root; the high takes the low as its foundation. Thus lords and kings call themselves 'orphaned,' 'widowed,' and 'destitute.'\"\n- In the *Biography of Emperor Yuan of Chu*, he quotes the *De Jing*: \"Knowing contentment avoids disgrace.\"\n- In the *Biography of Yan Zhu*, he notes: \"This is what Laozi meant by 'Where the army camps, brambles grow.'\" Yan Shigu comments: \"This is from the *Dao Jing*.\"\n- In the *Biography of Yang Xiong*, \"Those who value me are few,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"The *De Jing* states, 'Those who know me are few; thus I am valued.'\"\n- In the *Biographies of Harsh Officials*, Laozi’s words are cited: \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous, thus it possesses virtue; lesser virtue does not lose virtue, thus it lacks virtue. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\" Yan Shigu comments: \"This is from the *De Jing*.\"\n- \"When inferior scholars hear the Dao, they laugh greatly,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"This is from the *Dao Jing*.\"\n- In the *Treatise on the Western Regions*, the annotation quotes the *De Jing*: \"When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.\"\n\nAll these citations divide the text into *Dao* and *De* sections, aligning with Lu Deming’s *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations*, which titles them \"Dao Jing Pronunciation and Meaning\" and \"De Jing Pronunciation and Meaning.\" Jia Gongyan’s commentary on the *Zhouli* (*Rites of Zhou*) also cites the *Dao Jing*: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao,\" and subsequently references the *De Jing*: \"Supreme virtue is not virtuous, thus it possesses virtue.\" Zhanghuai Taizi’s commentary on the *Hou Hanshu* (*Book of Later Han*), in the *Biography of Zhai Pu*, quotes the *Dao Jing*: \"Fish cannot be removed from the spring.\"\n\nThese scholars, writing in the early Tang, uniformly attest to this division. The *Mengzhen Ke Stele* states: \"Examining the *Dao Jing*, compassion is its treasure.\" Such evidence must derive from Jin and Song dynasty editions, confirming the division in this stele as historically grounded.\n\nWang Chang remarked: The stele’s upper volume is titled *Laozi Dao Jing* and the lower *Laozi De Jing*, clearly separating *Dao* and *De* without conflation. Thus, Emperor Xuanzong’s commentary follows this ancient structure. Dong Qian’s *Catalogue of Collected Books* erroneously claims that Xuanzong’s commentary first reorganized the text into the *Daodejing*, grouping *Dao*-related passages in the upper volume and *De*-related passages in the lower. This is incorrect.\n\nWu Yun stated: The *Sui Shu Jingji Zhi* (*Bibliographic Treatise of the Sui History*) records the *Daodejing* in two volumes with Wang Bi’s commentary. Chao Yuezhi and Xiong Kezhong’s postscripts both assert that the text was not divided into *Dao* and *De* sections, yet the current *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations* clearly separates it into two volumes. Some suspect this division was added by later editors. However, Xing Bing’s *Lunyu Shu* cites the *De Jing* (\"The net of heaven is vast...\"), and Yan Shigu’s *Hanshu* annotations frequently reference the *Dao Jing* and *De Jing* as distinct. Thus, the division did not originate with Lu Deming. This stele’s inscription of the *De Jing* is well-founded.\n\nSun Yirang noted: The *Laozi*’s eighty-one chapters are divided into *Dao Jing* (upper) and *De Jing* (lower).",

      "translated_text": "The *Heshang Gong* version, the Wang Bi annotated edition recorded in the *Explanations of Texts and Pronunciations*, the Tang-era Fu Yi collated edition in the *Daoist Canon*, and the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s annotated stele edition all align in this regard. The *Hongming Ji*’s *Mouzi’s Treatise on Resolving Doubts* states: “The principles are rectified in thirty-seven clauses, which also incorporate the thirty-seven chapters of the *Dao Jing* from the teachings of Laozi.” Thus, as early as the Han dynasty, this text was already divided into the *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*, with the *Dao Jing* comprising thirty-seven chapters and the *De Jing* forty-four—matching precisely the modern edition. The extant Wang Bi commentary, derived from the Song-era collation by Chao Yuezhi, does not separate the *Dao* and *De* sections. While this may be coherent in meaning, it does not reflect the original form of the Han and Tang texts.\n\n**Chapter One**\nHong Yixuan remarked: The Wang Fusi (Wang Bi) edition of the *Daodejing* in circulation today uniformly includes chapter divisions. Though this edition does not record the total number of chapters, each chapter is demarcated by an empty space. Some divisions differ from the modern Wang Bi edition: for instance, in the current version, “The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible” through “it is the predecessor of the Emperor” forms three chapters; “Heaven and earth are not humane” through “it is better to abide in the center” forms four; and “The valley spirit never dies” through “its use is never exhausted” forms six—whereas this edition combines them into one. The lines “Thus, being is the benefit, non-being is the use” are attached to Chapter Twelve in the modern Wang edition, but here, the word “thus” is omitted, and the two lines are placed at the beginning of the following chapter. The lines “Heaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness” appear in Chapter Twenty-Six in the modern edition but are appended to the end of the preceding chapter here. Lu Deming’s *Pronunciations and Meanings of the Laozi* has already been altered by later hands in its chapter divisions, and it is regrettable that this edition cannot be compared against it.\n\n**The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;**\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal name.**\n\nYu Zhengxie observed: In these two lines by Laozi, the terms “Dao” and “name” differ from their usage elsewhere. Here, “Dao” refers to speech, and “name” to writing. The *Wenzi*’s *Essence and Sincerity* states: “The name that can be named is not the eternal name; inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved in metal and stone, these are but its coarse manifestations.” The *Superior Righteousness* chapter says: “Reciting the books of the former kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping their meaning. Thus, the name that can be named is not the eternal name.” The *Superior Ritual* chapter states: “The laws and measures of the former kings undergo change, hence ‘the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’” The *Huainanzi*’s *Original Dao* chapter declares: “The perfected person seals their mouth and silences their discourse, yet none in the world recognize the value of their silence. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.”",

      "translated_text": "Inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved in metal and stone—what can be transmitted to others is but its coarse form. Scholars of later ages, though learned and widely informed, are not immune to confusion.\n\nThe *Miu Cheng Xun* states: “That the Dao has chapters and defined forms is not its ultimate expression.” The *Dao Ying Xun* records: “Duke Huan was reading in the hall when Wheelwright Bian said, ‘What remains is but the dregs.’ Thus Laozi says: ‘The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’” All these take Laozi’s “Dao” as discourse and “name” as written words.\n\nYan Zhi notes: Yu’s interpretation is correct. Laozi composed his five thousand characters precisely to set forth the intent behind his words. For “Dao” is the general term for transformation. It shifts with the times, responding to things with change; though mutable, there is that within it which does not change—this is what is called “constant.”\n\nFrom early commentators on Laozi onward, many have held that the Dao cannot be spoken. Gao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi*’s *Fan Lun Xun* says: “The eternal Dao is deep, hidden, and obscure—it cannot be spoken.” The spurious *Guan Yinzi* expands this, claiming that “what cannot be spoken is the Dao.” In truth, Laozi’s book itself declares that “nothing is the function of the Dao, while something is its benefit”—it is not that the Dao cannot be spoken. He speaks of “beautiful words,” of “words having a ruler,” of “correct words seeming contradictory,” of “my words being very easy to know and very easy to practice”—all these are spoken, all can be expressed and named.\n\nYet commentators, fixating on one aspect, take “constant” to mean unchanging and immutable. What can be spoken and named is subject to change, while what cannot be spoken or named is beyond change (Lin Xiyi). Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is deemed unspeakable, and the name that can be named is deemed unnameable. They fail to grasp that Laozi’s Dao is ceaselessly shifting, flowing through the six directions—there is no eternally unchanging Dao, nor any eternally unchanging name. Therefore, in engaging the world, one has no fixed mind, “taking the hearts of the common people as one’s heart” (Chapter 49). In responding to things, one “establishes them in constant non-being” (*Zhuangzi*, “Under Heaven”), for words can be constantly non-existent or constantly existent, not clinging to old constancy. Not clinging to old constancy, it is called “not constant.” Yet in constant being and constant non-being, it is said: “Returning to the root is called constancy” (Chapter 16), “Knowing harmony is called constancy” (Chapter 55)—the constant is the inconstant.\n\nDay gives way to night, death to life; resting in the proper time and following the natural course, one moves with the times. As Zhuangzi says: “Life and death are fate, like the constant alternation of night and day—this is Heaven.” The Dao of Heaven and Earth endures without cease; the four seasons transform yet achieve lasting completion. If it were unchanging and immutable, how could there be anything called “constant”? Thus it is said: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.”\n\n“No-name” is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; “name” is the mother of the myriad things. Yan Kejun notes: “‘No-name’—most versions write ‘無’; the following instances follow this pattern. ‘The beginning of Heaven and Earth’—the *Yu Zhu* commentary matches this. The *He Shang Gong* and Wang Bi versions write ‘the beginning of Heaven and Earth,’ and the following line also includes the word ‘之.’” Wei Jiasun says: Yan’s collation note states: “Most versions write ‘無’; the following instances follow this pattern.” For the line “act without acting,” the collation note is the same. This edition of the *Dao De Jing* consistently writes “無” in the *Dao Jing*; in the *De Jing*, it writes “無” before “act without acting” and “無” thereafter. This line should read: “The *Dao Jing* follows this pattern.” Luo Zhenyu says: The Jinglong and Dunhuang versions write “無” throughout, as does the *Yu Zhu* stone edition. The two “之” characters are absent in the Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, and Dunhuang versions but present in the *He Shang Gong* version.\n\nYan Zhi notes: The *Jing Dian Shi Wen*, Volume 2, *Zhou Yi Yin Yi*, states: “‘無’ is pronounced *wu*; this character appears throughout the *Yi*. The *Shuo Wen* says: ‘An archaic character for *wu*, connected to *yuan*, signifying the Dao of emptiness and nothingness. Wang Yu explains that Heaven curves to the northwest, forming *wu*.’ The vulgar form is ‘旡,’ which is incorrect. ‘旡’ is pronounced *ji* and appears in characters like ‘既.’ Laozi writes ‘無,’ consistent with the *Yi*.” Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan’s versions all include the word “之.” Fan’s version writes “萬” as “万.” “No-name is the beginning of Heaven and Earth”—the *Shiji*, *Biographies of Diviners*, quotes it as “No-name is the beginning of the myriad things.” Wang Bi’s commentary states: “All things begin from nothing, so before form and name exist, it is the beginning of the myriad things.” This seems to treat both lines as referring to “myriad things,” which is incorrect.\n\nNote that “beginning” (*shi*) and “mother” (*mu*) have distinct meanings. The *Shuo Wen* says: “‘Beginning’ (*shi*) is the first stage of a woman.” “Mother” (*mu*) depicts a child in the womb—one interpretation is that it shows a child nursing. This distinction between the two states of named and nameless carries profound significance. Before Heaven and Earth arose, all was undifferentiated chaos, like a maiden’s first innocence, pure and unadorned. Chapter 25 of the text says: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth.” Chapter 40 states: “Being arises from non-being.” This is the nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth. “The myriad things of the world are born from being”—being engenders ceaseless generation. Chapter 42 says: “The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to the myriad things.”",
      "overlap_context": "he name that can be named is not the eternal name.” The *Superior Ritual* chapter states: “The laws and measures of the former kings undergo change, hence ‘the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’” The *Huainanzi*’s *Original Dao* chapter declares: “The perfected person seals their mouth and silences their discourse, yet none in the world recognize the value of their silence. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.”",

      "translated_text": "This is the named mother of the myriad things. The *Zhuangzi*’s “On the Equality of Things” also states: “Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one”—both instances juxtapose the terms “Heaven and Earth” and “the myriad things.” “Ever without, to observe its mystery; ever with, to observe its boundary.”\n\nFan Yingyuan says: The ancient editions, along with those of Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Li Ruoyu, and Zhang Junxiang, all include the word *gu* (故, “thus”) before “ever without.” He further cites the *Yinbian* (音辩), which states: “‘Ever without’ and ‘ever with’ should be read as a single phrase.” Wang Yinglin says: The practice of punctuating after “with” (*you*, 有) and “without” (*wu*, 無) in the first chapter began with Wang Jiefu. Yan Kejun says: The imperial commentary follows this same punctuation. In the editions of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi, the word *yi* (以, “by”) appears before “observe” in both clauses, but Luo Zhenyu notes that the three Dunhuang manuscripts all omit *gu* and the two instances of *yi*. Additionally, “boundary” (*jiao*, 徼) is written as *jiao* (皦) in the Dunhuang texts. Yu Yue says: The *Daodejing* stele engraved in the second year of Jinglong (708 CE) in Yizhou lacks both instances of *yi*, and this should be followed. Sima Wengong and Wang Jinggong both punctuate after “without,” which is also correct. Yi Shunding says: The *Zhuangzi*’s “Tianxia” chapter states: “Laozi heard of its teachings and delighted in them, establishing them upon ‘ever without and with’ (*chang wu you*, 常無有).” Here, “ever without” and “ever with” are treated as a single phrase, just as in this chapter—this usage already appears in the *Zhuangzi*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The imperial commentary, along with the editions of Xing Xuan, Jingfu, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Gu Huan, Peng Si, and Gao Di, all omit *gu*. For “boundary” (*jiao*), the editions of Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan agree with the stele, but the Dunhuang version’s *jiao* (皦) should be adopted. In Chapter 14, “its upper part is not *jiao* (皦),” the Jinglong stele also writes it as *jiao*, which is correct. The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (一切經音義), Volume 84, cites the *Shuowen*: “‘*Jiao* (徼)’ is written as ‘to patrol’ (*xun*), meaning to intercept.” Here, the sense of interception is irrelevant. Volumes 79 and 83 of the same work cite the *Shuowen*: “‘*Jiao* (皦)’ is composed of *ri* (日, sun) and its phonetic, though the two Xu editions omit it.” Tian Qian says: According to Hui Lin’s citation of the *Pipang* (埤倉), “it means ‘bright’ (*ming*),” and the *Yunhui* (韻會) also defines it as “bright,” though without specifying the source. The *Book of Songs* says, “as bright as the *jiao* sun,” and the *Shi Zhuan* (詩傳) explains: “*Jiao* means ‘radiant’ (*guang*).” The ancient edition of the *Shuowen* originally included the character *jiao*, but later generations sometimes borrowed *jiao* (皎) in its place. *Jiao* (皎) refers to the whiteness of the moon, as in the *Book of Songs* line, “the moon emerges, *jiao* bright.” Alternatively, they borrowed *jiao* (皦), which denotes the whiteness of white jade, as in the *Analects*’ “*jiao* as if.” Each character has its own semantic domain. In “as bright as the *jiao* sun,” *jiao* (皦) is firmly associated with *ri* (日, sun), not *bai* (白, white).\n\nThe text reads: “Ever without, observe its mystery.” “Mystery” (*miao*) refers to the subtle and minute, as Xun Yue’s *Shenjian* says: “What is profoundly subtle is called *miao*.” “Ever with, observe its *jiao* (皦)”—“*jiao*” here means “radiance” (*guangming*), forming a parallel with “mystery.” The implication is that what is manifest in principle is called *jiao*. These two emerge from the same source but have different names.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Chen Jingyuan’s *Cangshi Zuanwei* punctuates after “these two are the same” (*ci liang zhe tong*). Yan Fu says: The pause should come after “same,” for all things derive from the same. However, “emerge from the same” (*tong chu*) and “have different names” (*yi ming*) form a parallel structure, so punctuating after “same” is incorrect. Jiang Xichang says: The twelve characters following “these two are the same” are absent in Fan Yingyuan’s edition. Qian Zhi notes: The *Xugu Yizong Shu* edition of Fan’s text includes these twelve characters; Jiang’s emendation is mistaken. Chapter 40 states: “The myriad things of the world are born from being, and being arises from non-being.” Here, “these two” refer to being and non-being. Being and non-being have different names, yet the Dao unites them as one. “Both are called the profound. Profound and yet more profound—gateway to all mysteries.”\n\nZhang Heng says: “The profound (*xuan*) is the formless kind, the root of spontaneity. It acts at the Great Beginning, and nothing precedes it. It embraces virtue and power, enveloping Heaven and Earth, containing and regulating primordial *qi*, bestowing without form.” Yang Xiong says: “The profound is what is dark and vast, pervading the myriad kinds without manifesting form.” Both interpretations derive from this passage.\n\n**Phonology**\nLi Daochun says: “The phrasing of this text often harmonizes in rhyme.” Deng Tingzhen says: “Many works among the Masters employ rhymed prose, but none so densely as the *Laozi*. Apart from the *Book of Changes* and the *Book of Songs*, it is the most ancient.” Liu Shipei says: “To study the divisions of ancient rhyme, one must examine rhymed texts from the Zhou dynasty. Among Zhou works, aside from the *Book of Changes* and the *Li Sao*, none are as purely rhymed as the *Laozi*.” Today, we take Jiang Yougao’s *Laozi Yun Du* as the primary reference, supplemented by Wu Yu’s *Yun Bu*, Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, Jiang Yong’s *Guyun Biaozhun*, Yao Wentian’s *Guyin Xie*, Deng Tingzhen’s *Shuangyanzhai Biji* (Volume 3), and Li Gengyun’s *Bingzhu Bian*, to trace the ancient rhymes of the text, seeking patterns in its phrases and characters.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, Liu Shipei, Xi Dong, Chen Zhu, and Bernhard Karlgren’s *A Study of Rhymes in the Laozi* (*The Poetical Parts in Lao-Tsi*) present many conjectural theories on the ancient phonology of the *Laozi*, some of which are tenable. I have occasionally appended my own views, and thus it becomes evident that the five thousand characters of the text largely conform to phonetic harmony, forming a resplendent composition. Once the principles of rhyme are clarified, the beauty of its philosophical poetry becomes apparent.\n\nBelow, I shall examine the text chapter by chapter. For this chapter, Jiang Yougao’s *Laozi Yun Du* identifies the following rhymes:\n*Dao* (道) rhymes with *Dao* (道) in the *you* group;\n*ming* (名) rhymes with *ming* (名) in the *geng* group;\n*shi* (始) rhymes with *mu* (母) in the *zhi* group (*mu* read as *mǎnyǐ* in fanqie);\n*miao* (妙) rhymes with *jiao* (徼) in the *xiao* group (*jiao* in the departing tone);\n*xuan* (玄) rhymes with *men* (门) in a mixed *wen-zhen* rhyme (*xuan* read as *hújūn* in fanqie).\n\nQian Zhi’s note: *Xuan* (玄) belongs to the *zhen* group, while *men* (门) belongs to the *wen* group; the *wen* and *zhen* groups share rhymes.\nYao Wentian concurs, except for *xuan* and *men*.\nKarlgren, however, argues that *tong* (同) and *ming* (名) form a rhyme, which is incorrect.\nDeng Tingzhen also errs in claiming that *Dao* (道) and *Dao* (道), as well as *ming* (名) and *ming* (名), do not rhyme.\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version of this chapter contains fifty-four characters, matching the Dunhuang manuscript. The *Heshang Gong* version (Song dynasty edition), Wang Bi’s version (from the *Guyi Congshu*), Fu Yi’s version (from the *Jingxun Tang*), and Fan Yingyuan’s version (from the *Xugu Guyishu*) all contain fifty-nine characters. Yan Kejun observes: “A single character’s space follows the phrase *zhong miao zhi men* (众妙之门) to mark the division of chapters, though the imperial commentary does not include this space. The *Heshang Gong* version titles the preceding section *‘Tidao Di Yi’* (体道第一), while Wang Bi titles it *‘Chapter One.’* This version lacks such headings, and subsequent chapters follow this convention.” My own note: The *Laozi* originally comprised two scrolls, upper and lower; later generations divided it into chapters, resulting in variations of fifty-five, sixty-four, sixty-eight, seventy-two, or eighty-one chapters. Though the stele version does not record the number of chapters, each is separated by a blank space, aligning roughly with the divisions in the *Heshang Gong*, Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan versions. Thus, I adopt the chapter divisions as transmitted in these received texts. This chapter is titled *‘Dao Ke Dao Zhang Di Yi’* (道可道章第一) in Fan Yingyuan’s version. Chapter Two follows.",

      "translated_text": "All under heaven know beauty as beauty—this is already ugliness;\nAll know goodness as goodness—this is already not goodness.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* quotes the latter line as “All under heaven know goodness as goodness—this is already not goodness.” Peng Song observes: “The *Dazhen* and *Qingyuan* editions both include ‘under heaven’ before ‘all know goodness as goodness.’” Fan Yingyuan’s edition concurs, with Fan’s commentary noting: “Ancient edition.” The *Lunyu Jijie Yishu* (9) quotes “all know” as “take to know.” The *Guangming* and Zhao Mengfu editions render the final “已” as “矣,” while Li Daochun’s edition changes the first “已” to “矣.” Su Zhe’s and Dong Sijing’s editions replace both “已” with “矣.” “已” and “矣” were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Shuowen* (5) states: “矣 is a word marking completion, composed of 矢 and its phonetic.” The character was also written as “已.”]\n\nThus:\nBeing and non-being give birth to one another;\nDifficulty and ease complete one another;\nLong and short shape one another;\nHigh and low incline toward one another;\nTones and voices harmonize with one another;\nBefore and after follow one another.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The Dunhuang manuscript, Suizhou stele, and Gu Huan’s edition omit the word “thus.” In the six instances of “相,” the *Guangming*, *Jingfu*, *Qingyang*, *Panxi*, *Louzheng*, *Shitang*, Peng Song’s, Fu Yi’s, Fan Yingyuan’s, Gao Pi’s, and Zhao Mengfu’s editions, along with the *Hou Hanshu*’s commentary on Zhu Mu’s biography, all include the particle “之,” whereas Wang Bi’s and Heshang Gong’s editions omit it. Li Daochun remarks: “Adding ‘之’ to the six phrases from ‘Being and non-being give birth to one another’ onward is incorrect.” Yan Kejun notes: “‘Shape one another’—Wang Bi renders this as ‘compare one another,’ as recorded in the *Shiwen*.” Ma Xulun’s note: The reading “shape one another” is correct. Bi Yuan states: “Wang Bi’s ‘compare’ and Lu Deming’s ‘compare’ are both incorrect. The character ‘较’ did not exist in antiquity; the original text rhymes ‘shape’ with ‘incline,’ so ‘compare’ is clearly unsuitable.” Liu Shipei argues: “The *Wenzi* reads: ‘Long and short do not shape one another.’ The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* states: ‘Short and long shape one another.’ It is likely that Laozi’s original text also used ‘shape,’ rhyming with ‘birth,’ ‘complete,’ and ‘incline.’ ‘Compare’ was a later gloss, explaining ‘shape’; scribes then replaced ‘shape’ with ‘compare.’” Note: The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* reads: “Thus high and low incline toward one another, short and long shape one another,” including two instances of “也.” “Long” was altered to “修” to avoid the taboo of the father’s name. Ma Xulun states: “‘Compare’—all editions render this as ‘shape.’ The *Shuowen* records the ancient form of ‘荆’ as ‘○,’ so the ancient form of ‘形’ may also have been written with ‘○.’ The ‘爻’ component in ‘爻’ resembles the ‘爻’ in the ‘○’ form. Perhaps Laozi originally wrote ‘○,’ which was corrupted in transmission to ‘爻’; readers, finding it unintelligible, added the ‘车’ component to form ‘○.’ Later, ‘较’ became standard while ‘○’ fell out of use, resulting in the character ‘较.’”]\n\nTones and voices harmonize with one another;\nBefore and after follow one another.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: “Before”—the Dunhuang manuscript renders this as “先,” as do the Suizhou stele, Gu Huan’s, and Qiang Siqi’s editions. Jiang Xichang observes: “Gu Huan’s commentary in the *Cheng* edition reads ‘what comes first and what comes after,’ indicating that ‘before’ was originally ‘先.’ Qiang Siqi’s commentary states: ‘The later is seen through the earlier; the earlier is illuminated by the later.’ This also uses ‘先.’ Laozi’s text consistently pairs ‘先’ and ‘后,’ so this instance should not differ. Examples include Chapter 7: ‘Thus the sage places himself last and finds himself first’; Chapter 66: ‘To lead the people, one must place oneself behind them’; and Chapter 67: ‘Abandoning the last to grasp the first.’”]\n\nTherefore, the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.\n\n[Ma Xulun’s note: The Suizhou stele includes the character “治” after “人,” as does the Dunhuang manuscript. Cheng Xuanying’s commentary states: “Thus it is said, ‘Therefore the sage governs.’” The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (34) omits “治.”]\n\nThe myriad things arise yet do not decline;\n[Bi Yuan notes: Heshang Gong and Wang Bi both read: “The myriad things arise therein yet do not decline.” Lu Xisheng and the *Taiping Yulan* omit the word “therein.” Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, imperial commentary, and Jingfu editions all omit “therein.” Ma Xulun’s note: The Suizhou stele and Fu Yi’s edition also omit “therein.” Furthermore, “do not decline” is rendered as “do not initiate” in the Suizhou stele, Dunhuang manuscript, Fu Yi’s, and Fan Yingyuan’s editions. Fan Yingyuan states: “Wang Bi and Yang Fu follow the ancient edition.” Thus, Fan’s Wang Bi edition also reads “do not initiate.” Yi Shunding argues: The commentary in Wang Bi’s Chapter 17, which reads: “The great man, being above, dwells in non-action and practices the teaching without words; the myriad things arise therein yet do not initiate,” fully quotes this chapter’s text, proving that Wang Bi’s edition read “do not initiate,” though it included an additional “therein” compared to Fu Yi’s edition. Ma Xulun’s note: The reading “do not initiate” is correct and should be adopted as the standard. Bi Yuan states: “‘Initiate’ and ‘decline’ share the same sound, leading to this variation; Fu Yi’s interpretation is superior.” Lao Jian remarks: “The *Shuowen* records the seal script of ‘○’ as ‘,’ derived from 台. The *Xia Song Guwen Sisheng Yun* cites the stone classics’ ‘词’ as ‘○,’ and the ancient *Xiaojing*’s ‘始’ as ‘○.’ The ancient forms of these two characters were originally similar.”]",

Though the stele version does not record the number of chapters, each is separated by a blank space, aligning roughly with the divisions in the *Heshang Gong*, Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan versions. Thus, I adopt the chapter divisions as transmitted in these received texts. This chapter is titled *‘Dao Ke Dao Zhang Di Yi’* (道可道章第一) in Fan Yingyuan’s version. Chapter Two follows.",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, examining the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Valuing Impartiality” chapter, it states: “Heaven and Earth are vast indeed; they give life yet do not treat as their children, bring to completion yet do not possess. The myriad things all receive their benefit yet none know whence it begins.” The “Examining Distinctions” chapter further says: “Perfect in relation to the myriad things yet not controlling them, bestowing blessings upon the world yet none know whence it originates.” These passages both derive from this chapter of the *Laozi*, and the interpretation of “beginning” (*shi*) is superior.\n\n“Giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying”—\nLuo Zhenyu notes: “‘Giving life yet not possessing’ is absent in the Dunhuang manuscript.”\nMa Xulun observes: The Suizhou stele edition also omits this line. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (Volume 34) cites the same as this stone inscription.\n\n“Success is not dwelled upon.”\n“Only by not dwelling does it not depart.”\n\nYan Kejun states: The imperial commentary and Wang Bi’s edition read “success achieved and not dwelled upon,” while Heshang Gong’s version has “success achieved yet not dwelled upon.”\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jingfu edition reads “success achieved and not dwelled upon,” while the Dunhuang manuscript has “success achieved and not abiding.” Furthermore, “only by not dwelling,” in the Jinglong and imperial commentaries, “not” (*bu*) replaces “not” (*fu*), while the Dunhuang manuscript reads “not abiding.”\nMa Shulun remarks: Wang Bi’s commentary states, “Following things in their use, success arises from them, hence it is not dwelled upon.” Thus, Wang originally wrote “not dwelled upon.” The current “not” (*bu*) rendered as “not” (*fu*) may have been altered by later hands following Heshang Gong’s version.\nJiang Xichang observes: The *Huainanzi*’s “Responding to the Dao” chapter and the *Book of Later Han*’s annotation to the biography of Zhu Jun both cite “not” (*fu*) as “not” (*bu*). The *Yi Jing*’s *Xici* commentary’s *Zhengyi* quotes “yet not dwelled upon” as “not dwelled upon.” Qiang Ben’s *Yan* commentary reads: “Only by not daring to rest in dwelling,” where Yan’s “not” (*fu*) is “not” (*bu*). Qiang Ben’s citation of Cheng Xuanying’s subcommentary on the sutra text reads “success achieved and not abiding,” indicating Cheng wrote “success achieved and not abiding.” Ancient editions uniformly render “not” (*fu*) as “not” (*bu*). In Chapter 24, “Thus the person of the Dao does not abide”; in Chapter 38, “Not dwelling in its meagerness, not dwelling in its splendor”; and in Chapter 77, “Success achieved yet not abiding”—“not dwelling” (*bu ju*) or “not abiding” (*bu chu*) may be used interchangeably, as “dwelling” (*ju*) and “abiding” (*chu*) are largely synonymous. However, “not” (*fu*) is consistently rendered as “not” (*bu*). Comparing editions of the *Laozi* confirms that the original text was thus.\n\nThe *Lunheng*’s “Naturalness” chapter states: “Thus the greatness of non-action is evident. Originally not seeking success, yet success is established; originally not seeking fame, yet fame is achieved.” This precisely echoes this chapter’s “Only by not dwelling does it not depart.”\n\nFor all things under heaven, nothing exists without its counterpart; where there is contradiction, there is advancement. Thus, where there is beauty, a yet more beautiful contends with it, and beauty as beauty ceases to be beautiful. Where there is goodness, a yet greater goodness contends with it, and goodness as goodness ceases to be good. Therefore, being and non-being form a pair: the myriad things under heaven are born of being, and being is born of non-being—this is the mutual arising of being and non-being. Difficulty and ease form a pair: difficulty is made manifest by ease, and ease is made evident by difficulty. Without difficulty, there would be no way to know ease; without ease, there would be no way to know difficulty—this is the mutual completion of difficulty and ease. Long and short form a pair: an inch is short compared to a foot, and a foot is long compared to an inch. Without length, there would be no way to clarify shortness; without shortness, there would be no way to perceive length—this is the mutual shaping of long and short. High and low form a pair: mountains collapse into valleys, and valleys subside into mountains. Without mountains, there would be no way to perceive valleys; without valleys, there would be no way to know mountains—this is the mutual inclining of high and low. Sound and tone form a pair: joy and sorrow, lament and resentment arise differently. Without sorrow, there would be no way to know joy; without joy, there would be no way to know sorrow—this is the mutual harmony of sound and tone. Before and after form a pair: the former is seen by the latter, and the latter is made clear by the former. Without the latter, there would be no way to know the former; without the former, there would be no way to know the latter—this is the mutual following of before and after (following Yan Junping’s interpretation).\n\nFrom this perspective, all things under heaven are nowhere without contradiction, and nowhere are they not in mutual opposition, each acting in their own way. Only those without intention, who follow nature, do not seek success or fame, but govern by relying on things as they are. “Abiding in the affairs of non-action, practicing the teaching without words,” they penetrate deeply the principle of the myriad things’ mutual opposition and completion, waxing and waning, advancing with the times. The myriad things arise, yet I do not initiate; what I enact does not burden me with traces. Success achieved and affairs completed, I withdraw from my position. It cannot be deemed beautiful, hence it cannot be deemed ugly; it cannot be deemed first, hence it cannot be deemed last. Standing prior to opposition is called not dwelling; transcending the six realms of being and non-being is called not possessing. Possessing yet not possessing, things cannot precede it; dwelling in non-dwelling, it thus does not depart.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang Yong’s reading:\n*Sheng* (生), *cheng* (成), *xing* (形), *qing* (倾) rhyme (in the *geng* 耕 rhyme group);\n*he* (和), *sui* (随) rhyme (in the *ge* 歌 rhyme group; *sui* is read as *xu he* 徐禾);\n*shi* (事), *jiao* (教), *ci* (辞), *you* (有), *shi* (恃) rhyme (merging the *zhi* 之 and *xiao* 宵 rhyme groups; *jiao* follows the *xieyin ji* 协音记, *ci* is in the departing tone, *you* is read as *yi* 以);\n*ju* (居), *ju* (居), *qu* (去) rhyme (in the *yu* 鱼 rhyme group; *qu* is in the level tone).",

      "translated_text": "Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur, though they do not address *shi* (事) and *jiao* (教). Chen Zhu further pairs *yi* (已) with *yi* (已) as rhymes.\n\nQian Zhi notes: In the Dunhuang, Suizhou, Fu, and Fan editions, *ci* (辞) appears as *shi* (始), while in the Dunhuang edition, *ju* (居) is written as *chu* (处). Karlgren reads *shi* (始) as rhyming with *shi* (事), *jiao* (教), *you* (有), and *shi* (恃), and *chu* (处) as rhyming with *qu* (去). Moreover, *jiao* (教) belongs to the *xiao* (宵) rhyme group, while *shi* (事), *ci* (辞), *you* (有), and *shi* (恃) belong to the *zhi* (之) group, merging *zhi* and *xiao* as a single rhyme.\n\nGu Yanwu states: *Sui* (随) in ancient pronunciation is *ju he* (句禾反), citing the *Laozi*’s “sounds and voices harmonize, front and rear follow” (*yin sheng xiang he, qian hou xiang sui* 音声相和，前后相随), where *he* (和) and *sui* (随) rhyme. Corroborating evidence includes the *Guanzi*’s *Baixin* chapter: “Without a leader, there is no harmony” (*ren bu chang bu he* 人不倡不和), and “Without beginning, there is no following” (*bu shi bu sui* 不始不随). The *Hanfeizi*’s *Jie Lao* states: “When great villainy arises, petty thieves follow; when great villainy leads, petty thieves harmonize” (*da jian zuo ze xiao dao sui, da jian chang ze xiao dao he* 大奸作则小盗随，大奸唱则小盗和), and “Thus when the *yu* leads, the *zhong* and *se* must follow; when the *yu* sings, all instruments harmonize” (*gu yu xian ze zhong se bi sui, yu chang ze zhu yue jie he* 故竽先则钟瑟必随，竽唱则诸乐皆和”) (*Tang Yun Zheng*, *Zhi* 5).\n\nJiang Yougao states: *Ci* (辞) is pronounced *si zi* (似兹切), but in ancient times it had a departing tone, as in the *Laozi*’s *Yangshen* chapter: “The myriad things arise yet do not decline” (*wan wu zuo yan er bu ci* 万物作焉而不辞), rhyming with *shi* (事) and *jiao* (教). He further notes: *Ju* (居) is pronounced *jiu yu* (九鱼切), but in ancient times it also had a departing tone and should be grouped with the *yu* (御) rhyme. In the *Laozi*’s *Yangshen* chapter, “Achieving merit yet not dwelling” (*gong cheng er bu ju* 功成而不居) rhymes with *qu* (去) (*Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng*, *Zhi* 7 and *Yu* 9).\n\nThe *Jinglong* stele edition contains seventy-eight characters; the Dunhuang edition, eighty-five; the Heshang, Wang Bi, and Fu Yi editions, eighty-eight; the Fan Yingyuan edition, ninety-seven. The Heshang edition titles this “Nurturing Life, II” (alternatively, “The Chapter of Beauty and Goodness”), the Wang Bi edition titles it “Chapter Two,” and the Fan edition titles it “When All Under Heaven Know, Chapter Two.”\n\n**Chapter Three**\nDo not exalt worthies, and the people will not contend;\nDo not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered.\n\nYan Kejun states: In all editions, *shang* (上) appears as *shang* (尚). Luo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang edition reads *bu shang bao* (不上宝). Qian Zhi observes: *Shang* (上) is correct; *bao* (宝) is likely an error. *Shang* (上) and *shang* (尚) are interchangeable. The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su* chapter quotes the *Laozi*: “‘Do not exalt worthies’ means not luring fish into trees or sinking birds into the abyss” (*bu shang xian* 不上贤), also using *shang* (上), consistent with the *Jinglong*, Dunhuang, and Suizhou editions. The Suizhou edition writes *min* (民) as *ren* (人), as does the following clause.\n\nDo not value hard-to-obtain goods, and the people will not steal.\nQian Zhi notes: The Heshang, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions all include *wei* (为) after *dao* (盗), while the Suizhou, Dunhuang, and *Yuzhu* editions omit it, as does this stele. The *Beitang Shuchao* (27) cites it as “Do not value goods, and the people will not steal” (*bu gui huo, shi min bu dao* 不贵货，使民不盗), also lacking *wei* (为).\n\nDo not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered.\nYan Kejun states: In Wang Bi’s edition, *shi* (使) is followed by *min* (民). Bi Yuan notes: The Heshang edition reads “and the heart will not be disordered” (*shi xin bu luan* 使心不乱), omitting *min* (民). The *Huainanzi* also omits it. Yi Shunding states: The *Jin Shu*’s biography of Wu Yinzhi reads: “Do not display what is desirable, and the heart will not be disordered” (*bu jian ke yu, shi xin bu luan* 不见可欲，使心不乱). The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Dongjing Fu* and Shen Yue’s commentary on the *Zhongshan* poem both omit *min* (民). Wang Bing’s commentary on the *Suwen* (1) also omits it. Ji Yun states: The original and all editions lack *min* (民), except the *Yongle Dadian*, which includes it. According to Wang Bi’s commentary, “Thus what is desirable is not displayed” (*gu ke yu bu jian* 故可欲不见), following “risking life to steal” (*mo ming wei dao* 没命为盗), the text originally included *min* (民). Liu Shipei states: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Dongjing Fu* cites it as “and the heart will not be disordered” (*shi xin bu luan* 使心不乱), and Kong Yingda’s commentary on the *Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram also omits *min* (民), likely due to Tang-era taboo deletions. The ancient text actually included *min* (民), consistent with the two preceding instances.\n\nQian Zhi counters: Ji and Liu’s arguments are incorrect. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: “Breaking in, prying into chests, risking life to steal—thus when what is desirable is not displayed, the heart has nothing to disorder” (*chuan yu tan qie, mo ming er dao, gu ke yu bu jian, ze xin wu suo luan ye* 穿窬探箧，没命而盗，故可欲不见，则心无所乱也), showing Wang’s edition lacked *min* (民). The *Yongle Dadian* likely follows Wu Cheng’s edition in erroneously adding it. Liu claims the omission resulted from Tang-era taboo deletions, unaware that the ancient text lacked *min* (民). The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (34) also omits it. If this were related to taboos, why were the two preceding *min* (民) not also deleted? This is not a case of arbitrary deletion but of arbitrary addition. However, Wu Cheng had a basis: Chu Suiliang’s postscript to Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy (dated Zhenguan 15) reads “and the people’s hearts will not be disordered” (*min xin bu luan* 民心不乱), matching the Fu and Fan editions, indicating the error is long-standing. Though the Fu and Fan editions claim antiquity, they were altered by later hands, their wording often more verbose than other editions—this is one example.\n\nThe sage governs:\nYan Kejun states: All editions include *shi yi* (是以) before this clause, and Wang Bi’s edition adds *zhi* (之) after *ren* (人). Wu Yun notes: The Fu edition reads “The sage’s governance” (*sheng ren zhi zhi* 圣人之治) followed by *ye* (也); Li Daochun omits *zhi zhi* (之治). Qian Zhi observes: Including *zhi* (之) is correct.\n\nEmpty their hearts, fill their bellies, weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Shiwen* records *qiang* (强) as also written *qiang* (强).",

      "translated_text": "The Dunhuang manuscript reads *qiang* (强). Qian Zhi observes: The Lou Zheng edition also reads *qiang* (强). Furthermore, *Qunshu Zhiyao*, juan 34, cites: “Thus the sage’s governance constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire,” omitting the four phrases “empty their hearts, fill their bellies, weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones.”\n\nConstantly keep the people without knowledge and without desire.\nYan Kejun states: “Constantly keep the people” (*chang shi min* 常使民) appears as “keep people” (*shi ren* 使人) in the *Yu Zhu* edition. Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yu Zhu* edition avoids the taboo by using *ren* (人). Qian Zhi observes: The Wang Xizhi edition omits *chang* (常), while the Suizhou stele edition omits *min* (民).\n\nLet the knowing ones not dare to act, and there will be nothing left ungverned.\nYan Kejun states: “Let the knowing ones” (*shi zhi zhe* 使知者) includes the character *fu* (夫) after *shi* (使) in all editions. “Not dare to act” (*bu gan wei* 不敢为) is followed by the three characters *wei wu wei* (为无为) in all editions, and by the four characters *ye wei wu wei* (也为无为) in Wang Bi’s edition. Luo Zhenyu notes: *Zhi* (知) appears as *zhi* (智) in modern editions; the *Shiwen* lists the two characters *zhi zhe* (知者) and glosses *zhi* (智), indicating that Wang Bi’s edition originally read *zhi* (知). The Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, and Dunhuang editions also read *zhi* (知). Moreover, the Jinglong, *Yu Zhu*, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions all omit *ye* (也) after *wei* (为). Qian Zhi observes: According to Luo’s facsimile of the *Zhen Song Tang Cang Xirui Miji Congcan* collation of the Dunhuang manuscript, *bu* (不) appears after *gan* (敢), an omission in Luo’s *Kaoyi*. The Suizhou stele edition also reads *bu gan bu wei ye* (不敢不为也).\n\nQiang Siqi cites Cheng Xuanying’s commentary: “Having already relinquished both desire and non-desire, one further fears that those without desire may become attached to the view of emptiness, taking non-desire as the Dao. Thus, ‘not daring not to act’ (*bu gan bu wei* 不敢不为) is to dispel non-desire. One fears clinging to this non-action, hence the subsequent ‘not daring’ (*bu gan* 不敢).” Cheng’s commentary also originally read *bu gan bu wei* (不敢不为). Only Gu’s edition of Cheng’s commentary reads “thus, ‘not daring to act’ (*bu gan wei* 不敢为) is to dispel non-desire,” omitting this *bu* (不). Now, *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) are two distinct matters, corresponding to the earlier “without knowledge, without desire” (*wu zhi, wu yu* 无知、无欲). The phrase should be punctuated after *bu gan* (不敢).\n\nIn Chapter 30 of the text, “not by seizing strength” (*bu yi qu qiang* 不以取强), all editions include *gan* (敢) after *bu* (不), but *gan* (敢) is a superfluous character. However, in Chapter 67, “I dare not act as the first in the world” (*bu gan wei tian xia xian* 不敢为天下先); in Chapter 69, “I dare not act as the host but act as the guest, dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot” (*wu bu gan wei zhu er wei ke, bu gan jin cun er tui chi* 吾不敢为主而为客，不敢进寸而退尺); and in Chapter 73, “Being brave in not daring brings life” (*yong yu bu gan ze huo* 勇于不敢则活), *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) are paired, indicating that Gu’s edition of Cheng’s commentary contains errors of omission in the base text. Laozi’s original meaning is this: constantly keep the general populace without knowledge and without desire, and constantly keep the few who know from daring to act or acting. In this way, there will be spontaneous transformation through tranquility, and nothing will remain ungoverned.\n\nFurthermore, *bu gan* (不敢) and *bu wei* (不为) constitute “governing by not governing” (*bu zhi zhi zhi* 不治治之). The *Lunheng*, in its “Naturalness” chapter, states: “When Qu Boyu governed Wei, Zigong sent someone to ask him, ‘How do you govern Wei?’ He replied, ‘I govern it by not governing.’ This ‘governing by not governing’ is the Dao of non-action.” This meaning derives from Laozi. Laozi’s intent is that the highest governance is no governance. What the world calls governance—exalting the worthy causes the people to contend; prizing rare goods causes the people to steal; displaying what is desirable disturbs their hearts. Now, if one reverses this, so that the people see no one to exalt, no goods to prize, and nothing to desire, then they will return to simplicity and preserve purity. Constantly keeping the people without knowledge and without desire, they will naturally become tranquil, neither contending nor stealing nor disordering. This is why the knowing ones dare not act. In an age of perfect virtue, the ruler is like the tip of a branch, and the people are like wild deer—chewing their food in joy, drumming their bellies in play. This is the ancient era of non-action, where the people transform themselves, soaring in spontaneity, and nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* finds no rhyme. Karlgren takes *fu* (腹), *gu* (骨), and *yu* (欲) as rhyming, as does Chen Zhu. Chen further takes *zhi* (治) as rhyming with them, stating: “This is likely a shift in the sound of *ge* (歌).” Qian Zhi observes: Wang Niansun’s *Mao Shi Qun Jing Chu Ci Gu Yun Pu* places *yu* (欲) and *fu* (腹) in the *you* (幽) rhyme group, citing the *Yue Ji*: “The noble person delights in attaining the Dao” (*jun zi le de qi dao* 君子乐得其道), where *dao* (道) and *yu* (欲) rhyme. In the fourth stanza of the *Shijing*’s “Liao’e,” *ju* (鞫), *xu* (蓄), *yu* (育), *fu* (复), and *fu* (腹) rhyme. In the *Chu Ci*’s “Tian Wen,” *yu* (育) and *fu* (腹) rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi further observes: *xian* (贤) and *zheng* (争) rhyme. Kong Guangsen’s *Shi Sheng Lei*, in the second section on yang sounds, lists the character *jian* (坚) under the twentieth entry, stating: “In the *Xing Wei* (行苇): ‘The sturdy bows are already firm (*jian* 坚), the four arrows are already balanced, the arrows are already released in order, and the guests are arranged by worthiness (*xian* 贤).’ The character *jian* (坚) is derived from *○*, which is the ancient form of *xian* (贤). Today, in the seventeenth division of the *zhen* (真) rhyme, there is the character *xian* (礥), which is the correct pronunciation of *xian* (贤).” He further lists *xian* (贤), stating: “In the *Bei Shan* (北山): ‘The great officers are not equal, and I alone am worthy (*xian* 贤) in my tasks.’ See *jian* (坚) above.” Now, *xian* (贤) and *zheng* (争) are phonetically close; the old Indian translation of *xian dou* (贤豆) serves as collateral evidence. Wang Niansun’s *Gu Yun Pu* places *xian* (贤) in the *zhen* (真) rhyme group alongside *jian* (坚), while *zheng* (争, pronounced *zhen* 真) is in the *geng* (耕) group. This serves as evidence for the interrhyming of *zhen* (真) and *geng* (耕).\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains 57 characters; the Dunhuang edition, 58; the Heshang edition, 66; the Wang Bi edition, 67; the Fu edition, 68; and the Fan edition, 69.",

      "translated_text": "The *Heshang* edition titles this \"Pacifying the People, Third,\" the *Wang* edition titles it \"Chapter Three,\" and the *Fan* edition titles it \"The Chapter on Not Exalting the Worthy, Third.\"\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is empty (*chong*), yet its use is inexhaustible.\nYan Qian notes: “*Chong* (冲) appears as *zhong* (盅) in Fu Yi’s edition. *Zhong* is the ancient form of *chong*.” The *Shuowen* under the *min* (皿) radical states: “*Zhong*: a vessel’s emptiness. *Laozi* says, ‘The Dao is empty (*zhong*) and thus used.’” Guo Zhongshu’s *Han Jian* (上之二) cites the character *chong* (冲), quoting the ancient *Laozi* as ○.\nBi Yuan says: “The *Shuowen Jiezi* cites this text as *zhong*, while all other editions read *chong*. The *Huainanzi* also reads *chong*, but both are incorrect.” For emptiness within a vessel is called *zhong*; being empty, it holds things. Thus, the *Zhuangzi*’s “Responding to Emperors” states: “Great emptiness (*zhong*) is invincible.”\nYan Kejun says: “‘Inexhaustible over time’ (*jiu bu ying*)—other editions read ‘perhaps inexhaustible’ (*huo bu ying*).” Luo Zhenyu says: The Jinglong stele reads *jiu* (久), while the Dunhuang edition reads *you* (又), a corruption of *jiu*. Yu Yue says: “‘The Dao is empty (*zhong*) and thus used’—*zhong* means emptiness, directly opposing *ying* (盈, fullness). *Chong* is a borrowed character.” In Chapter 45, “Great fullness seems empty (*chong*),” *chong* should also be written as *zhong*.\nHe further notes: “‘Perhaps inexhaustible’ (*huo bu ying*)—the Tang Jinglong stele reads ‘inexhaustible over time’ (*jiu bu ying*). Emptiness that remains inexhaustible over time is true emptiness (*zhong*), far superior to modern editions.” The *Heshang Gong* commentary states: “*Huo* means ‘constant.’” To gloss *huo* as “constant” is unattested in antiquity; the *Heshang* edition likely originally read *jiu*.\nYan Qian notes: The reading *jiu* is correct. The *Taiping Yulan* (322) quotes the *Mozi*: “One who skillfully maintains victory weakens the strong, hence *Laozi* says, ‘The Dao is empty (*chong*) and thus used, yet it is not full (*you bu ying*).’” *You bu ying* (有弗盈) means *you bu ying* (又不盈). Jia Changchao’s *Qun Jing Yin Bian* states: “*You* means *you* (又). Wang Bi’s commentary reads: ‘Thus it is empty and used, yet again not full (*you fu bu ying*).’” This shows the *Wang* edition also reads *you*, not *huo*. *You*, *you*, and *jiu* were interchangeable in antiquity.\nMa Xulun says: “The *Mozi* quotes it as *you*, the *Heshang* as *huo*, and the Yizhou edition as *jiu*—these four characters were interchangeable in antiquity. *You* (又), *you* (有), and *huo* (或) were mutually interchangeable, as seen in the *Jingzhuan Shici*. In meaning, *jiu* is superior. *You* (又), *you* (有), and *jiu* (久) are also interchangeable. The *Zhuangzi*’s ‘Perfect Joy’ reads: ‘Man *you* (又) returns to the mechanism.’ The *Liezi*’s ‘Heaven’s Endowment’ reads *jiu* (久) for *you*. The *Liezi*’s ‘Heaven’s Endowment’ states: ‘The spirit is heaven’s *jiu* (久).’ Yin Jingshun and Chen Jingyuan’s *Shiwen* note: ‘*Jiu* is pronounced *you* and originally written *you* (又).’ The *Hanshu*’s ‘Yang Wangsun’ says: ‘The spirit is heaven’s *you* (有).’ This is drawn from the same passage, serving as further evidence. The sounds of *you* (又), *jiu* (久), and *you* (有) all belong to the same phonetic category.”\nYan Qian notes: In Fu Yi’s edition, *ying* (盈) appears as *man* (满). Lu Deming says: “*Ying* is also written *man* in some editions.” *Ying* and *man* share the same meaning. The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (13) cites the *Shuowen*: “*Ying* means ‘a vessel full.’” The two Xu editions read “full vessel.” Tian Qian says: “Under the *shui* (水) radical, *yi* (溢) is defined as ‘a vessel full.’ A full vessel is *yi*, which is also *ying*. Thus, under *man* (满), it states: ‘*Ying* means overflowing.’ The gloss is quite clear.” This confirms that *ying* and *man* are interchangeable, though the original text should read *ying*.\nMa Xulun says: “The character *man* in other editions appears as *ying* because, as Xun Yue says: ‘To avoid the taboo on *ying*, it was changed to *man*.’ Emperor Hui of Han was named *Ying*, so the character was altered to *man* in deference.

This line also appears in Chapter 56, where Heshang Gong annotates: “‘Tangled’ means knotted resentment.” ... In that chapter, he comments: “‘Tangled’ means unceasing knotted resentment.” The annotations are largely identical. Thus, the Heshang edition’s *fen* (‘fragrant’) should be read as *fen* (‘resentment’). If taken literally, the gloss’s meaning of “knotted resentment” becomes unintelligible. ... Wang Bi’s edition of Chapter 56 writes *jie qi fen* (‘untie its divisions’), with the note: “Eliminate the source of contention.” Here, too, *fen* is read as *fen* (‘resentment’). Gu Huan’s edition correctly writes *fen* (‘resentment’), which is the proper character, while *fen* (‘fragrant’) and *fen* (‘tangled’) are both loan characters.\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: “‘Untie its tangles’ appears in Heshang Gong’s edition as *fen* (‘fragrant’).” He notes that *fen* (‘fragrant’) should be *fen* (‘resentment’). This line appears in Chapter 4 and again in Chapter 56. In the old manuscript of the Heshang Gong edition, the latter chapter writes *fen* (‘resentment’), while this chapter writes *fen* (‘tangled’). Wang Bi’s edition of Chapter 56 writes *fen* (‘divisions’), but his annotation reveals that *fen* (‘divisions’) is a corruption of *fen* (‘resentment’). This chapter aligns with the old manuscript of the Heshang Gong edition, and both Wang Bi’s and Heshang Gong’s editions share the same character. By the time of the *Jinglong* stele and the Dunhuang manuscript, *fen* (‘tangled’) in this chapter was revised to *fen* (‘resentment’), restoring the loan character to its proper form.\n\nTan Xian observes: Chapter 56 also includes the four lines “Blunt its sharpness...,” suggesting a possible interpolation. “Abiding in stillness, it seems ever-present.”\n\nYan Kejun notes: Heshang Gong’s edition reads *zhan xi si ruo cun* (‘still, it seems as if present’), while Wang Bi’s edition reads *zhan xi si huo cun* (‘still, it seems perhaps present’).\n\nLuo Zhenyu states: Both the *Jinglong* and *Imperial Commentary* editions read *zhan chang cun* (‘still, ever-present’), while the Dunhuang edition reads *zhan si chang cun* (‘still, it seems ever-present’).\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio adds: The Dunhuang edition of this line reads *zhan ran chang cun* (‘still and ever-present’), while the Suzhou edition reads *zhan si chang cun* (‘still, it seems ever-present’).\n\nWang Chang remarks: The Xingzhou edition includes the character *zhi* (‘it’) after *shui* (‘who’) in the following line.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan editions match Wang Bi’s version. The Xingzhou edition was once thought to be the Suzhou edition, but this is now known to be incorrect. In Chapter 14, the line “This is called the indistinct and evanescent” is recorded by Wang Chang as identical across all editions, though the Xingzhou edition omits it. However, the Suzhou edition does include it, writing *shi wei hu huang* (‘This is called indistinct and evanescent’), providing further evidence.\n\nThe character *zhan* (‘still’), as defined in the *Shuowen*, means “submerged.” The *Xiao Er Ya Guang Yu* states: “‘Submerged’ means ‘nonexistent.’” Here, “still and ever-present” describes its empty numinosity, unobscured—seemingly nonexistent yet truly present.\n\n“Whose child am I?

      "translated_text": "Yan Kejun states: “‘Whose child’ is rendered as ‘whose child’ (*shui zhi zi*) in the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions.” Jiao Hong notes: “‘Whose child’ (*shui zhi zi*) is absent in Chen Bixu’s Sima edition.” Luo Zhenyu observes: “The Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and Dunhuang versions all omit the character *zhi* (‘whose’).” Qian Zhiji comments: The Muromachi edition includes *qi* (‘its’) before *shui* (‘who’) and *zhi* (‘whose’) after it. However, the omission of *zhi* is correct. The *Guang Ya*’s *Shi Yan* states: “‘Child’ (*zi*) means ‘resembles’ (*si*).” Thus, “I know not whose child” (*wu bu zhi shui zi*) means “I know not whom it resembles,” and the meaning is complete. This passage asks: Is it spirit? Is it sovereign? The one this world calls the master of life and death—yet the Dao alone precedes it. The Dao dwells in the realm of doubt and semblance, as if one knew not whose child it is; yet it is self-so and self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth and enduring since antiquity.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhymes, according to Jiang Yong: *fen* (纷), *chen* (尘), *cun* (存), and *xian* (先) rhyme (Wen rhyme group; *xian* read as *si yin*). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur. Deng notes: “‘*Xian*’ was anciently read like ‘*shen*.’” Qian Zhiji adds: *zhong* (盅), *ying* (盈), and *zong* (宗) also rhyme. Xi Di, Chen Zhu, and Bernhard Karlgren agree. Yao Nai states: “‘The Dao is empty’ (*dao chong*) forms a phrase, rhyming with *zong* (宗), signifying the Dao’s essence as utterly empty.” Xi Di notes: *zhong* (盅), *ying* (盈), and *zong* (宗) rhyme. The shift between Dong and Geng rhyme groups is seen elsewhere, as in Chapter 24, where *gong* (功) rhymes with *ming* (明), and in the *Zhuangzi*’s “In You” chapter, where *chong* (虫) rhymes with *qing* (情), *cheng* (成), and *ming* (鸣). Further, *fen* (纷), *chen* (尘), and *xian* (先) rhyme. The *Huangdi Neijing Suwen*’s “Eight Rectifications’ Spiritual Clarity” chapter rhymes *xian* (先) with *shen* (神) and *cun* (存), while the *Chu Ci*’s “Summons of the Soul” rhymes *xian* (先) with *fen* (纷) and *chen* (陈). Qian Daxin states: The *Shuowen* reads *chong* (冲) like *dong* (动). The *Book of Documents*’ “I am but a youth” (*yu wei chong ren*) is glossed in the *Shi Wen* as *zhi zhong* (直忠反). Anciently, *zhi* (直) was read like *te* (特), so *chong zi* (冲子) is akin to *dong zi* (动子). Qian Zhiji further notes: “Ever-present in stillness” (*zhan chang cun*)—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include *xi* (兮) after *zhan* (湛). The particle *xi* is most common in the *Chu Ci*, and the *Laozi* already marks its beginning. Kong Guangsen’s *Shi Sheng Lei* (7) states: “‘*Xi*’ appears in the *Tang* rhyme group under twelve *qi*, but its ancient pronunciation lacks firm evidence. Yet the *Tai Shi*’s ‘*duan duan yi*’ is cited in the *Great Learning* as ‘*duan duan xi*’, suggesting *xi* and *yi* share sound and meaning. *Yi* was anciently read as *e* (阿), so *xi* should likewise be read as *e*.”\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains thirty-seven characters and is not divided into chapters.",

See *Shiwen* and *Qunshu Zhiyao*.\n\nLi Wenzhong (zi Jian) states: “‘*Chu* (刍),’ as per the *Shuowen*, means ‘to cut grass,’ depicting the form of bundled grass. The Suizhou edition writes *chu* as ‘二屮,’ which is the character *cao* (草). The common addition of ‘grass’ is incorrect.”\nLiu Shipei notes: *Chugou* refers to objects used in ancient sacrificial rites. The *Huainanzi*’s *Qi Su Xun* states: “It is like the initial completion of *chugou* or earthen dragons: adorned with blue and yellow, draped in fine silk, bound with vermilion threads, the spirit-mediums in ceremonial dress, the grand officers in full regalia, to send them off and welcome them back. Yet once used, they become mere clods of earth and bundles of grass—who would value them?” Gao You’s commentary: “*Chugou* are straw dogs made of bundled grass, used to seek blessings and atone for transgressions.” The *Shuo Shan Xun* says: “The sage employs things as if binding *chugou* with vermilion threads,” and further: “*Chugou* are treated with reverence to seek blessings.” Gao’s commentary: “By honoring the spirit of *chugou*, one obtains blessings.” Thus, in ancient sacrifices, *chugou* were universally used to seek blessings. They are straw dogs made of bundled grass, akin to straw effigies—objects used at first but discarded afterward. Laozi’s meaning here is that heaven and earth treat the myriad things, and the sage treats the hundred clans, as things first used and then abandoned, hence the analogy to *chugou* to condemn their lack of humanity.\nQian Zhiji notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Gui Gong* chapter cites the same two lines from Laozi in Gao You’s commentary. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Gengsang Chu* chapter states: “Perfect humanity has no partiality,” the *Qi Wu Lun* states: “Great humanity is not humane,” and the *Tian Yun* chapter states: “Before *chugou* are displayed, they are stored in fine baskets, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the spirit-mediums fast and purify themselves to present them.

Another entry (vol. 12) states, ‘排筒,’ where the *Dongguan Hanji* reads ‘因水作排,’ and Wang Bi’s commentary explains, ‘橐 is a bag.’ (The *Yupian*’s *○* section defines ‘’ as ‘a bellows for blowing fire.’) Based on Xuanying’s account, the Wang Bi commentary he saw rendered ‘排橐’ as ‘bag,’ whereas modern editions and Lu Deming’s *Shiwen* both write ‘排橐’ (*Shiwen* notes: ‘排, *fubai*’—the same sound as *pibai*. ‘排橐’ also appears in the *Huainanzi*’s *Benjing xun* with Gao You’s commentary). The character ‘排’ aligns with the *Hanji*, suggesting that Wang Bi’s commentary may have existed in two versions during the Tang dynasty.\" (Modern editions of Wang Bi’s commentary do not separate the *Dao* and *Virtue* chapters, differing from the *Shiwen* version. Furthermore, the *Bianzheng lun* by Shi Falin cites commentary on the chapter \"Man models himself on earth, earth on heaven,\" which diverges from modern editions—additional evidence that Wang Bi’s commentary circulated in variant versions during the Tang.)\n\nThe interpretation of *yue* as a musical pipe aligns with Cheng Xuanying’s view (\"钥 is a panpipe\") but differs from Wu Cheng’s explanation of *tuoyue*. Wu Cheng states: \"‘橐钥’ refers to the device used in smelting to blow air and intensify the fire. The outer casing that encloses it is the *tuo* (bellows); the inner mechanism that fans the air is the *yue* (pipe). That heaven and earth resemble a *tuoyue* means the *tuo* symbolizes the great void, embodying the all-encompassing and pervasive body, while the *yue* symbolizes primordial *qi*, manifesting the dynamic and flowing function.\" Wu’s interpretation is more compelling.\n\nEmpty yet inexhaustible, moving and ever producing.

The Fu edition writes \"诎\" for \"屈.\" Lao Jian says: \"According to the *Shuowen*, ‘屈’ means tailless, extended to denote anything short, hence the sense of exhaustion. ‘诎’ means bent, the original character for ‘bending and straightening.’ *Jue* (掘) and *hu* (搰) gloss each other. The *Shiwen* cites Gu’s note ‘like exhaustion,’ treating it as a loan for *qu* (屈). The Fu edition’s ‘诎’ misinterprets it as bending and straightening, which is incorrect. This character should be ‘屈,’ glossed as exhaustion, pronounced *jue*.\" Bi Yuan says: \"俞\" appears as \"愈\" in all editions.

However, the character \"loyalty\" (忠) lacks semantic coherence here. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* quotes the preceding two lines as \"abide in the center\" (守中), which is correct. Furthermore, the phrase \"many words\" (多言) appears as \"much learning\" (多聞) in the Sui Prefecture stele, and the *Wenzi*’s *Daoyuan* chapter likewise cites it as \"much learning.\" In his *Chengshu*, Qiang Ben glosses: \"‘Much learning’ means broad and ample; ‘frequent exhaustion’ refers to excessive speech.\" This is merely a forced interpretation based on the Sui edition.\n\nQian further notes: Regarding the \"center\" (中) in \"abide in the center,\" Zhang Binglin’s *Wenshi* 7 states: \"‘Center’ originally referred to documents such as registers. Thus, the *Chun Guan*’s *Tianfu* states: ‘For all offices, prefectures, districts, and towns, the *zhizhong* receives and stores them.’ Zheng Sinong comments: ‘*Zhizhong* refers to the essential records of administrative duties.’ The *Qiu Guan*’s *Xiao Sikou* states: ‘Using the three deliberations, they judge the *zhong* of the people’s lawsuits; at year’s end, they order the officials to tally the concluded cases and present the *zhong* to the *Tianfu*.’ The *Liji*’s *Liyi* states: ‘Relying on famous mountains, they present the *zhong* to Heaven.’ Presenting the *zhong* is like ascending the *zhong*, meaning they offer registers of the people’s numbers and the essentials of governance. The *Yaodian*’s ‘truly grasp its center’ refers to holding the charts and registers.\" The \"abide in the center\" in this chapter carries the same meaning, akin to managing tallies.\n\nLuo Yunxian states: \"‘Center’ is also a tally. Governing does not lie in excessive speech but in upholding the legal tally to assist the world—this is the meaning of ‘non-action.’\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads: *qu* (屈) and *chu* (出) as rhymes (both in the *zhi* group), while *qiong* (穷) and *zhong* (中) rhyme (both in the *zhong* group). All scholars concur. Kong Guangsen’s *Shisheng Lei* 5, in the yang tone’s *dong* category, cites the *Analects*: \"The celestial reckoning is in your person; truly grasp its center. If the Four Seas suffer exhaustion, Heaven’s emolument will forever end.\" The *Daodejing*’s *Daojing* states: \"Many words lead to frequent exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.\" The *Dejing* states: \"Great fullness resembles emptiness; its use is inexhaustible.\" The *Zhuangzi* states: \"I have come and gone, yet know not its end; I wander in vastness, where great knowledge enters yet knows not its exhaustion.\" The *Guanzi* states: \"Promote what is beautiful to observe its end; discard what is detested and surely calculate its exhaustion.\" Generally, the shared rhymes do not extend beyond the three characters *zhong* (中), *zhong* (终), and *qiong* (穷), demonstrating the narrowness of the *dong* rhyme, which cannot be loosely conflated with *dong* or *zhong*.\n\nQian’s note: The *Zhuangzi*’s *Qiwulun* states: \"The pivot begins to grasp its ring’s center to respond to the inexhaustible,\" also rhyming *zhong* (中) and *qiong* (穷). Moreover, in the *Daodejing*, the characters preceding *zhong* (中) and *qiong* (穷)—*shu* (数) and *shou* (守)—also rhyme with each other, forming a \"rhyme above the rhyme.\" This follows Ma Xulun’s explanation, as seen in the postface to the *Mao Shi Zheng Yun*.",

However, the ancient character for ‘愈’ did not exist; it is likely a substitution for ‘俞.’ All editions are incorrect.\"\n\nToo many words lead to frequent exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.",

      "translated_text": "The forty-four characters of the Jinglong stele are presented without chapter divisions, matching the Dunhuang version. The He, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions contain forty-five characters. The He Shang text titles this \"Vacuity and Function, Chapter Five,\" the Wang edition titles it \"Chapter Five,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"Heaven and Earth Are Not Humane, Chapter Five.\"\n\n**Chapter Six**\n\"The valley spirit does not die;\nThis is called the mysterious female.\"\n\nBi Yuan notes: Lu Deming states, \"In the He Shang text, *gu* (谷) is written as *yu* (浴), with the gloss: '*Yu* means to nourish.'\" The Later Han stele inscription by Chen Xiang (Bian Shao) for Laozi also writes it as \"*yu* spirit,\" aligning with the He Shang version. Yu Yue comments: The character *yu* (浴) truly lacks the meaning of nourishment. In the He Shang text, *yu* should be read as *gu* (谷). The *Book of Songs* in the \"Xiao Bian,\" \"Liao E,\" and \"Si Yue\" sections all state: \"None among the people do not *gu*.\" Mao’s commentary consistently glosses *gu* as \"to nourish.\" *Gu* (谷) is also interchangeable with *gu* (谷). The *Erya*’s \"Explanation of Heaven\" states: \"The east wind is called *gu* wind.\" The *Shi Jing* commentary by Sun Yan cites: \"*Gu* is spoken of as *gu*; *gu* means to generate, and generation is also nourishment.\" The version Wang Bi relied upon writes *gu* (谷), which is a loan character for *gu* (谷). The ancient He Shang text writes *yu* (浴), which is a variant of *gu* (谷). Hong Yixuan states: According to the *Explanation of Characters*, the He Shang text writes *yu* (浴). The *Book of Changes* states, \"The noble person restrains anger and suppresses desires,\" where Meng Xi’s version writes *yu* (浴). Both *gu* (谷) and *yu* (浴) are loan characters for *yu* (欲). *Mencius*’ \"Jinxin, Part Two\" states: \"To nourish the mind, nothing is better than reducing desires.\" Thus, it is by desire that the spirit does not die. The *Liexian Zhuan* records: Rongcheng Gong excelled in the arts of supplementation and guiding, drawing essence from the mysterious female. Its essential teaching is that the valley spirit does not die—it is the preservation of life and the nourishment of qi. This aligns with the same meaning. Xu Zi states: According to the He Shang commentary, *gu* is glossed as nourishment, so it should be *gu* (谷). Mao’s commentary on the *Book of Songs*, Zheng’s annotations, and the *Guangya*’s \"Explanation of Terms\" all state: \"*Gu* means to nourish.\" This is because *gu* (谷) and *gu* (谷) are interchangeable, a phonetic loan. The *Book of Documents*’ \"Canon of Yao\" states, \"The western dwelling is called Meigu,\" while the *Rites of Zhou*’s \"Feng Ren\" commentary writes, \"The western measurement is called Liugu.\" This is what the *Da Dai Li Ji* refers to as \"the autumn sacrifice at Liugu.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* writes it as \"Liugu.\" In the *Zhuangzi*, \"Zang and Gu herd sheep,\" Cui Zhuan’s version writes \"Zang and Gu herd sheep,\" serving as evidence. Furthermore, the *Explanation of Characters* states: \"*Gu* is written as *yu* in the He Shang text, with the gloss: '*Yu* means to nourish.'\" This differs from the current version. Hong Kuo’s *Lishi* records the Laozi inscription: \"Some have *yu* spirit does not die.\" Thus, the ancient version originally wrote *yu* (浴). *Gu* (谷) is a loan for *gu* (谷), and *yu* (浴) is in turn a loan for *gu* (谷).\n\nQian’s note: Writing \"*gu* spirit\" is correct. Modern Song editions and the Daozang He Shang text all write *gu* (谷), not *yu* (浴). The *Liezi*’s \"Tian Rui\" chapter cites the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious female.\" Yu Jianwu’s poem states: \"Discussing the Dao ceases at the valley spirit.\" Yu Xin’s poem states: \"In vacuity, nourish the valley spirit.\" The Later Han’s Gao Yifang’s *Qing Jie* states: \"When wisdom and thought are utterly exhausted, the valley spirit endures ceaselessly.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"The two characters *gu* and *shen*, according to Fu Yi, mean 'profound and penetrating.'\" All read *gu shen* as a compound. However, in the *Laozi*, *gu* and *shen* are in fact opposed. Chapter Thirty-Nine states: \"The spirit obtains the One and becomes numinous; the valley obtains the One and becomes full,\" serving as evidence. Sima Guang states: \"It is called *gu* because it is empty within; it is called *shen* because it is unfathomable. Heaven and earth have limits, but the Dao is limitless, hence it is said not to die.\" Yan Fu states: \"Because it is empty, it is called *gu*; because it responds endlessly, it is called *shen*; because it is inexhaustible and ever-emerging, it is said not to die. These three are all virtues of the Dao.\" Thus, reading *gu* and *shen* as a compound is mistaken.\n\n\"The gate of the mysterious female\nIs the root of heaven and earth.\"\n\nYan Kejun states: The He Shang and Wang Bi texts include the character *zhi* (之) before *men* (门) and *shi wei* (是谓) before *tian di* (天地). Qian’s note: The Suizhou, Dunhuang, and Imperial Commentary editions are identical to this stele.\n\n\"Vague and elusive, it seems to endure;\nIn its use, it is not exhausted.\"\n\nQian’s note: *Mianmian* (绵绵) is written as *mianmian* (绵绵) in all other editions. Cheng Xuanying states: \"*Mianmian* describes something subtle and unbroken.\" *Mian* (绵) is a vulgar character. The *Yu Pian* states: \"*Mian* is new silk floss, entangling, unceasing. Now written as *mian* (绵).\" The *Five Classics Textual Criticism* states: \"Writing *mian* (绵) is erroneous.\" Furthermore, after *mianmian* (绵绵), the Jingfu edition includes the character *xi* (兮), and the Shitang edition includes *hu* (乎). The character *qin* (勤) is written as *qin* (懃) in Takeuchi’s collated edition. Hong Yixuan states: *Qin* (勤) is interchangeable with *qin* (廑). Li Shan’s commentary on the *Wen Xuan*’s \"Changyang Fu\" cites the *Gu Jin Zi Gu*: \"*Qin* is the modern *qin* (勤).\" Jin Zhuo’s commentary on the *Book of Han*’s \"Annals of Emperor Wen\" states: \"*Qin* is the ancient *qin* (勤).\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Qin* means slight and inferior.\" This describes its qi as *mianmian*, seemingly enduring, and in its use, not weak or diminished.

      "translated_text": "Yao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen did not include *death* (死) and *yin* (牝) with the character *gate* (门) in rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Wang Niansun’s *Ancient Rhyme Tables* cites the \"Yi Benming\" chapter of the *Great Dai’s Record of Rites*, where the four lines \"The lofty are for life\" rhyme *death* (死) and *yin* (牝). Xue Hui states: The *Laozi* generally employs rhyme, thus its diction often alters words to harmonize, not to derive meaning from a single character. For instance, in this chapter, \"This is called the mysterious *yin*\" (玄牝) reads *yin* (牝) as *fou* (否) to rhyme with the preceding line. When it says \"the gate of the mysterious *yin*,\" it merely extends the phrase to rhyme with the following line. Some later interpreters, however, impose arbitrary explanations, designating a specific place as \"the gate of the mysterious *yin*,\" which is entirely mistaken.\n\nGu Yanwu says: Regarding *gu* (谷, \"valley\"), though the *Guangyun* lists two pronunciations—*yushu* (余蜀) and *gulu* (古禄)—*yu* (欲) is the proper sound. The *Yi Jing*, \"Jing\" hexagram, line nine (\"the valley shoots at the minnows\"), Lu Deming’s *Sound and Meaning* gives one pronunciation as *yu* (浴). The *Book of Documents*, \"Canon of Yao\": \"Dwelling in the eastern Yi is called Yanggu\" (旸谷), one pronunciation is *yu* (欲). The *Zuo Tradition*, Duke Xi’s thirty-second year, note: \"This road lies between the two Xiaos in the southern valley,\" one pronunciation is *yu* (欲). The *Records of the Grand Historian*, \"Biography of Fan Kuai\": \"Smashed the *xi* Hu cavalry at Henggu,\" the *Justice* states: \"*Gu* is pronounced *yu* (欲).\" The \"Biographies of Merchants\": \"Livestock reached the point of measuring horses and oxen by *gu*,\" the *Suoyin* states: \"*Gu* is pronounced *yu* (欲).\" The Han-era *Inscription for Laozi of Ku County*: \"The valley spirit does not die\" (谷神不死) writes it as \"the bathing spirit\" (浴神), which is correct. When shifted to the departing tone, it is pronounced *yu* (裕). Today, people read *gu* (谷) as *gu* (谷) and add the \"mountain\" radical to form *yu* (峪), pronouncing it *yu* (裕), which is incorrect (*Tang Yun Zheng*, entering tone, third *zhu* group).\n\nHe further states: *Yin* (牝), ancient pronunciation *fuli* (扶履) reverse. The *Laozi*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*.\" Corroborating evidence: The *Wenzi*, \"Guarding the Weak\": \"To be the *yin* of all under heaven is how the spirit does not die.\" The \"Natural\" chapter: \"All under heaven has a beginning, yet none know its principle. Only the sage knows its cause—neither female nor male, neither *mu* nor *yin*, born yet not dying\" (Scroll 8, *Shi Zhen*).\n\nJiang Yong says: *Yin* (牝) is pronounced *pili* (毗履). The *Laozi*: \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*.\" Now, *yin* (牝) takes its sound from *bi* (匕), yet its modern pronunciation is *piren* (毗忍), a shift in later regional phonology, like *min* (敏) becoming *meiyun* (眉陨), *zhun* (准) becoming *zhiyin* (之尹), *sun* (隼) becoming *xiyun* (息允), and *yin* (○) becoming *juyin* (居隐). Gu’s claim that the *yin* (牝) character’s sound was altered because its common usage was deemed inelegant is incorrect (*Ancient Rhyme Standards*, rising tone, second division).\n\nYan Kejun says: *Yin* (牝) is included in both the *zhi* (旨) and *zhen* (轸) rhyme groups of the *Guangyun*. Examining the *Great Dai’s* \"Yi Benming,\" where *death* (死) and *yin* (牝) harmonize, and the *Laozi*’s \"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious *yin*,\" neither has shifted into the *zhen* (轸) group (*Shuowen Sound Categories*, first scroll, *zhi* group).\n\nWei Jiangong says: The six lines—*death* (死), *yin* (牝), *gate* (门), *root* (根), *enduring* (存), and *diligent* (勤)—all harmonize. The *Classic’s Exegesis and Pronunciation*: \"*Yin* (牝), *pinen* (频忍) reverse; old pronunciation *fusi* (扶死) reverse; Jianwen’s pronunciation *fujin* (扶紧) reverse.\" The old pronunciation harmonized with *death* (死), while later it was altered to harmonize with *gate* (门), *root* (根), and the other characters. Originally, they must have all harmonized completely (*Research on Ancient Phonology*, 294).\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version of this chapter contains twenty-two characters, combining from \"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible\" to this point as a single chapter. The Dunhuang version has twenty-three characters; the Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Fan Yingyuan versions have twenty-five; and the Fu Yi version has twenty-six. The Heshang Gong version titles it \"Forming Images, Sixth\"; the Wang Bi version titles it \"Chapter Six\"; and the Fan Yingyuan version titles it \"The Valley Spirit Does Not Die, Sixth.\" **Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts.**",

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth endure so long because they do not live for themselves—thus they can endure forever. Yan Kejun notes: \"For 'endure so long' (长久者), the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions include an additional 'and' (且) after 'long' (长).\" Qian Zhi observes: The Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan versions concur. The Suizhou Stele reads \"Heaven and Earth endure long.\" Moreover, \"Heaven endures, Earth lasts\" was likely an ancient saying, here cited and expounded.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character \"故\" is indistinct in the stele due to erosion. For \"endure forever\" (长久), other versions read \"long life\" (长生). Yan Kejun states: \"The *Wangshi Cuibian* cites the Xingzhou version as identical to this. The Yizhou stone pillar and the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read 'long life'—this is incorrect.\" Further, the Dunhuang version and the *Jin Ji Zhan’s Yi Taiji Lun* both read \"endure forever.\" Here, the character \"久\" is likely a loan for \"有,\" differing slightly from the previous two instances of \"久.\" The *Liezi: Tianrui* states: \"The spirit is Heaven’s *you*; the Dao’s advance toward the root is not *you*.\" The commentary notes: \"Should read *you*.\" Thus, \"can endure forever\" means \"can endure and possess.\" Therefore, the sage places himself last yet comes first; sets himself aside yet endures. Qian Zhi notes: The Du Guangting version omits these two lines. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* cites \"Thus Laozi said: 'Places himself last yet comes first; sets himself aside yet endures'\"—consistent with all other versions.\n\nBy being selfless, he fulfills his self. Yan Kejun notes: \"By being selfless\" (以其无私)—the *Shiwen* cites the Heshang Gong version as identical. The *Yuzhu* and Wang Bi versions include \"非\" before \"以,\" and Wang Bi’s version ends with \"邪.\" Qian Zhi observes: Chen Bixu states: \"The Heshang Gong and Yan Junping versions read '以其无私,' while the ancient Wang Bi version reads: '不以其无私邪?' The Yan version Chen saw matches this stele. The Wang Gu version aligns with the Fu and Fan versions, as well as the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*. The Guangming, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Gao Bi, Fan Yingyuan, and Muromachi manuscript versions match the current Wang Bi version. The Suizhou Stele reads: '此其无尸，故能成其尸.'\" The *Qiang Ben Chengshu* commentary states: \"尸 means 'master'... saying 'fulfills his *shi*' concludes in praise of the sage.\" The text Cheng relied on was likely the Suizhou Stele. However, writing \"私\" as \"尸\" is incorrect. The *Hou Han Shu: Fangshu Zhuan* glosses \"尸解\" as: \"Claiming to ascend as an immortal, one feigns death to transform.\" This is Daoist immortality lore intruding into Laozi’s original text, as seen in the *Qiang Ben Chengshu* and the Suizhou Stele.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang Yong’s *Vernacular Reading*, has no rhyme. Yao Wentian: \"先 and 存 rhyme,\" as does Xi Zhao. Chen Zhu: \"生 and 生 rhyme; 先, 存, and 私 rhyme.\" The character \"私\" shifts in sound to align with \"先,\" just as \"西施\" is also written \"先施.\" Qian Zhi notes: \"长生\"’s \"生\" in the Dunhuang, Jinglong, and Suizhou versions all read \"长久,\" showing this chapter rhymes 久, 久, 久, while 生 and 生 do not rhyme. Moreover, \"不自生\"’s \"生\" enters the *geng* rhyme group, harmonizing with \"先\" and \"存\" in the *wen* group—this is *wen* and *geng* inter-rhyming.\n\nThe Jinglong Stele version of this chapter contains forty-six characters; the Dunhuang version matches it. The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan versions have forty-nine. The Heshang Gong version titles it \"Concealing Light, Seventh\"; the Wang Bi version, \"Chapter Seven\"; and the Fan Yingyuan version, \"Heaven Endures, Earth Lasts, Chapter Seven.\"\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Virtue Resembles Water.**\nThe highest virtue is like water. Water benefits all things yet does not contend. Yan Kejun notes: \"Yet does not\" (又不)—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read \"而不.\" Qian Zhi observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (58) omits \"善,\" and \"万\" appears as \"万.\" \"Yet does not contend\" (又不争) is consistent in the Dunhuang, Suizhou, *Yuzhu*, Lou Zheng, Sima Guang, Cao Daochong, Qiang Siqi, Li Rong, and Muromachi versions. The Fu and Fan versions read \"而不争,\" matching the Wang Bi version.\n\nFurther, ancient Daoist discourse often likened the Dao to water. The *Guanzi: Shuidi* states: \"Earth is the root of the myriad things, the foundation of all life. Water is Earth’s blood, flowing like veins and arteries.\" It also says: \"What is water? The root of the myriad things, the ancestral hall of all life.\" This aligns with Laozi’s thought. The *Huainanzi* states: \"Of all things under Heaven, none is weaker than water, yet its greatness is boundless, its depth unfathomable. It extends endlessly, flows infinitely, waxes and wanes without measure. As rain and dew in the sky, as moisture and nourishment on Earth, it enables all things to live and all affairs to succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows blessings even on crawling insects without seeking reward, enriches the world without exhaustion, and bestows virtue upon the people without cost.\" Xue Juncai remarked that the *Huainanzi*’s exposition truly expands on \"benefits all things\"—this is evident.\n\nDwelling where the multitude □ what they detest, it nearly approaches the Dao. Qian Zhi notes: After \"人,\" other versions include \"之,\" but the stele is eroded. Lu Deming states: \"处 is also written 居.\" The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi versions read \"处,\" while the Fu and Fan versions read \"居.\" The Dunhuang version matches this stele.",

      "translated_text": "The Muromachi edition includes the character \"矣\" after \"Dao.\" Ōta Seiken states: \"几\" is read in the level tone, meaning \"near.\" The *Xici* commentary to the *Book of Changes* says: \"Heaven and Earth may nearly come to rest.\" The *Record of Ritual and Music* states: \"To understand music is to nearly approach ritual.\" The annotation explains: \"几 means near.\" The *Yu Fu* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* says: \"This nearly leads to no escape.\" The *Great Music* chapter of the *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: \"Then one nearly understands it.\" The annotation explains: \"几 means near.\" The Dao is formless, whereas water still possesses form. Thus, while water benefits all things and living beings in a visible manner, it cannot compare to the formless bestowal of the Dao. Hence, it is said to \"nearly approach the Dao.\" Modern interpreters mistakenly gloss \"几\" as \"mechanism\" or \"turning point.\"\n\nThe *Yuan Dao Xun* of the *Huainanzi* states: \"The formless is the great ancestor of all things; the soundless is the great origin of all sounds. Its child is light, its grandchild is water—both born of the formless!\" Light can be seen but not grasped; water can be followed but not destroyed. Thus, among all things with form, none is more revered than water.

According to ancient usage, it was exclusively read in the level tone; by the Han, it was occasionally read in the departing tone and should be grouped with the Zhen 部.

The *Xunzi*, *Youzuo* chapter, records: \"Confucius observed the temple of Duke Huan of Lu, where there was an unstable vessel. His disciples drew water and poured it in: when half-full, it stood upright; when full, it overturned; when empty, it tilted. Confucius sighed deeply and said, 'Alas! How can anything full not overturn?'\" This illustrates the fear of abundance’s tendency to spill—better to stop in time.\nYan Junping writes \"殖而盈之.\" Chen Bixu comments: \"This refers to accumulating wealth and treasures.\" Qian Zhi notes: This likely stems from misreading the following line, \"金玉满室，莫之能守,\" and erroneously altering the preceding text.\n\nTo sharpen and refine it cannot be preserved for long.\nYan Kejun notes: \"而锐\" appears as \"而棁\" in Wang Bi’s edition; \"长保\" appears as \"长宝\" in the Xingzhou edition.\nQian Zhi notes: \"揣而锐之\" appears as \"○而棁之\" in the Fu Yi edition and as \"○而锐之\" in Gao Miao’s edition.\nBi Yuan says: The *Shuowen Jiezi* does not include the character \"○.\" The Fu Yi edition provides a phonetic gloss for this line: \"○ is pronounced as *chuai* (揣), meaning 'to measure.'\" The meaning of \"measure\" aligns with \"揣.\" As the *Zuozhuan* states, \"揣高卑\" (\"measuring high and low\"), could \"○\" be an ancient form of \"揣\"?\nQian Zhi notes: \"揣\" is a regional term in the *Laozi*. Yang Xiong’s *Fangyan* (13) defines \"揣\" as \"to test,\" with Guo Pu’s commentary: \"揣度试之\" (\"to measure and test\"). Defining \"揣\" as \"test\" is unclear; it should be glossed as \"to break\" or \"to forge.\" Gu Huan’s annotation reads: \"to refine.\" The *Jiyun* states: \"揣 means to strike and forge.\" Both are correct. In Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* (Vol. 3), the \"揣\" character cites the ancient *Laozi* as \"○,\" and the Fu Yi edition as \"○,\" which is the ancient form of \"揣.\"\nSun Yirang says: \"○\" is a variant of \"揣,\" as recorded in the *Jiyun* (4 Zhi). However, based on the commentary’s meaning, \"揣\" should be read as \"捶\" (*chui*, \"to hammer\"). The *Jiyun* (34 Liang) lists \"○\" as a variant of \"捶,\" and the two characters were interchangeable in ancient script. Wang [Bi] states: \"既揣末令尖，锐之令利\" (\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpen it to a fine edge\"), referring to forging hooks and needles to make them sharp (Heshang Gong’s edition uses \"锐\" for \"棁\"). The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, states: \"大马之捶钩者\" (\"the great horse that hammers hooks\"). Gao You’s commentary: \"捶 means to strike and forge.\" The *Shuowen*, under the hand radical, defines \"揣\" as \"to measure; also, to hammer.\" Thus, \"揣\" and \"捶\" are phonetically related and interchangeable. Fu Yi’s emendation of \"揣\" to \"○\" does not alter the text but glosses it as \"to measure,\" which is incorrect.\nYi Shunding says: The character \"棁\" should follow Heshang Gong’s edition as \"锐.\" The *Shuowen* defines \"棁\" as \"a wooden staff,\" which cannot be the object of \"揣而棁之.\" The *Jingdian Shiwen* cites Wang Bi’s edition as \"棁\" but notes the pronunciation as \"菟夺反\" and \"徒活反.\" The *Yupian*, under the hand radical, lists \"捝\" as having two pronunciations: \"徒活切\" and \"兔夺切,\" with the *Shuowen* gloss: \"to untie.\" The wood radical’s \"棁\" appears twice, once as \"之悦切\" and once as \"朱悦切,\" with no \"菟夺\" or \"徒活\" readings. Thus, the *Shiwen*’s \"棁\" is clearly a misprint for \"捝.\" ... In reality, Wang Bi’s edition uses \"锐,\" differing from the ancient edition’s \"捝.\" The commentary states: \"既揣末令尖，又锐之令利，势必摧衄\" (\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpening it to a fine edge will inevitably lead to breakage\"), which confirms this. The *Wenzi*, *Weiming* chapter, and the *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, both use \"锐,\" in agreement.",

Ma Shulun states: \"Peng Song cites the *Shiwen* as having the correct character ‘捝.’ It appears that Wang Bi’s edition originally wrote ‘捝’ but read it as ‘锐.’\" Jiang Xichang remarks: \"Liu Weiyong’s *Kaoyi* notes: ‘Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi all follow the ancient edition.’ It also cites Wang Bi’s version of the text as ‘揣而锐之,’ indicating that Liu saw Wang’s edition as having ‘锐.’ Ye’s claim that Wang’s edition has ‘锐’ is thus accurate.\" Takeuchi Yoshio observes: \"‘揣而棁之’ appears in the *Heshang Gong* edition as ‘锐.’\" Examining Wang Bi’s commentary—\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpening it to a fine edge\"—it is clear that Wang took \"棁\" as a loan for \"锐,\" while the *Heshang Gong* edition uses the standard character \"锐.\"\n\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall, none can preserve them.\nChen Qian’s note: \"Hall\" in the *Shiwen* is given as an alternate reading \"室.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"The character ‘室’ appears in the editions of Yan Zun, Yang Fu, and Wang Bi, all matching the ancient edition.\" Modern collation shows that the Fu edition also uses \"室,\" and \"室\" is the superior reading. The *Shuowen* defines \"室\" as \"fullness,\" while the *Shiming* explains: \"filled with people and things.\" The versions of Yan Junping and Wang Bi seen by Chen Bixu also use \"室.\" Wealth and honor breed arrogance, inviting one’s own misfortune.\nYan Kejun notes: \"‘而骄’ appears in the *Yu zhu* as ‘而憍.’\" Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, and Jingfu editions all write \"○,\" a variant form of \"咎.\" Chen Qian’s note: The Lou edition and Sima Guang’s edition also write \"憍\" for \"骄,\" while Gao Diao’s edition uses \"○.\" The phrase \"自遗其咎\" appears in the *Qunshu zhiyao* as \"还自遗咎\" and in the Muromachi edition as \"还自遗其咎.\" The * Yupian* defines \"咎\" as: \"The *Shuowen* states: ‘disaster, composed of 人 and 各, indicating mutual opposition.’\"\n\nWhen merit is achieved, fame attained, and the self withdrawn, this is the Dao of Heaven.\nYan Kejun notes: Wang Bi’s edition reads \"功遂、身退,\" while Fu Yi’s edition has \"成名、功遂、身退,\" and the Xingzhou edition reads \"名成、功遂、身退.\" Luo Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, and Jingfu editions all read \"功成、名遂、身退.\" The Jingfu edition includes an additional \"也\" after \"道.\" Chen Qian’s note: The *Wenzi*, *Shangde* chapter, cites: \"功成、名遂、身退, 天道然也.\" The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, also quotes: \"故老子曰：‘功成、名遂、身退，天之道也.’\" Both include the particle \"也.\" Additionally, the \"身退\" in the Kaiyuan *Yu zhu* appears as \"身○.\" The *Zijian* states: \"○, the *Shuowen* defines as ‘to retreat, composed of 月, 从, and 从.’ The vulgar form is ‘退.’\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, as analyzed by Jiang Yong: 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme (之 and 幽 are interchangeable; 已 aligns with the *you* sound, while 保 is read as ○). Yao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen’s analysis: 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme. \"保\" in ancient pronunciation is *bu fou* cut, while \"道,\" as a rising tone, belongs to the 幽 rhyme group in ancient phonology. Chen Qian’s note: 已 is pronounced *yi* and appears in the stele edition as \"以.\" 以 belongs to the 之 rhyme group, while 保, 守, and 咎 belong to 幽, and 道 spans both 之 and 幽, forming an interchangeable rhyme. This should include the two instances of \"之\" in \"盈之\" and \"锐之,\" thus rhyming 之, 以, 之, 保, 守, 咎, and 道. Karlgren also includes \"骄\" in the rhyme with 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道. Xi Dong notes: 已, 保, 守, 咎, and 道 rhyme, with 之 and 尤 being interchangeable, as in the *Yi*’s *Heng* hexagram, where \"道\" rhymes with \"已\" and \"始.\" Jiang Yong’s *Guyun biaozhun* places \"保\" in the upper rising tone, eleventh division, with supporting evidence: \"永言保之\" rhymes with 寿 and 考; \"他人是保\" rhymes with 栲, 杻, 扫, and 考; \"南土是保\" rhymes with 宝 and 舅; \"王躬是保\" rhymes with 考. Collateral evidence includes Laozi’s \"揣而锐之，不可长保，金玉满堂，莫之能守.\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains forty-one characters; the Dunhuang and Fu Yi editions match this count. The *Heshang Gong* and Fan Yingyuan editions have forty characters, while Wang Bi’s edition has thirty-nine. The *Heshang Gong* titles this chapter \"运夷第九,\" Wang Bi’s edition titles it \"九章,\" and Fan’s edition titles it \"持而盈之章第九.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nCan you embrace the soul and hold fast to the One without separation?\nYan Kejun notes: \"能无离\" in Fu Yi’s edition and recent printings of Wang Bi’s edition include the particle \"乎\" at the end of this phrase, as do the following five phrases. Yu Yue observes: The *Heshang Gong* edition omits \"乎,\" as does the Tang Jinglong stele. However, the *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, quotes Laozi: \"载营魄抱一，能无离乎？专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？\" indicating that the ancient edition did include \"乎.\" Chen Qian’s note: The \"乎\" is a superfluous interpolation. Luo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong, *Yu zhu*, Dunhuang (versions B and C), and British Library editions all omit \"乎,\" as do the subsequent instances. Li Daochun remarks: \"The addition of ‘乎’ in ‘抱一能无离’ and the following five phrases is incorrect.\"",
      "overlap_context": "radical’s \"棁\" appears twice, once as \"之悦切\" and once as \"朱悦切,\" with no \"菟夺\" or \"徒活\" readings. Thus, the *Shiwen*’s \"棁\" is clearly a misprint for \"捝.\" ... In reality, Wang Bi’s edition uses \"锐,\" differing from the ancient edition’s \"捝.\" The commentary states: \"既揣末令尖，又锐之令利，势必摧衄\" (\"having hammered the tip to a point, sharpening it to a fine edge will inevitably lead to breakage\"), which confirms this. The *Wenzi*, *Weiming* chapter, and the *Huainanzi*, *Daoying* chapter, both use \"锐,\" in agreement.",

      "translated_text": "The initial character \"載\" (zài), according to Guo Zhongshu’s *Pei Xi* (Vol. 1): \"Thus, in the first scroll of the *Laozi*, ‘載’ was altered to ‘哉’.\" The annotation states: \"Emperor Xuanzong of Tang decreed: ‘Reverently following the sagely teachings, I have deeply pondered the profound origins. Recently, I changed the character ‘載’ in the *Daode Jing* to ‘哉’, attaching it to the preceding text. After deliberation, all agreed, and thus the true meaning was interwoven to form this commentary.’\"\n\nSun Yirang’s *Zha Yi* notes: \"The old commentaries all treat ‘天之道’ as the end of a chapter and read ‘載營魄抱一’ as a single phrase. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter and the *Qunshu Zhiyao* (Vol. 39) both include the particle ‘也’ after ‘道’, with the same chapter division. The *Chu Ci*’s *Yuanyou* states: ‘載營魄而登霞兮.’ Wang Yi’s commentary explains: ‘Embracing my spirit-soul to ascend.’ Qu Yuan seems to have borrowed from the *Laozi*. Thus, from pre-Qin and Western Han times to the present, those who interpret this text have all read it without variation. Only the *Cefu Yuangui* records Emperor Xuanzong’s decree from the fifth year of Tianbao (746): ‘Recently, I changed the character ‘載’ in the *Daode Jing* to ‘哉’, attaching it to the preceding sentence to form the commentary.’ Guo Zhongshu’s *Pei Xi* also states: ‘In the first scroll of the *Laozi*, ‘載’ was altered to ‘哉’,’ with the annotation likewise citing this decree.\n\nExamining Wang Bi’s edition of the *Daojing* (Chapter 37) and Xuanzong’s annotated edition, only Chapter Ten contains the character ‘載.’ Thus, the ‘載’ Xuanzong altered to ‘哉’ must be this instance, and he also reattached it to the preceding chapter’s ‘天之道’ as a single phrase. The stone inscription of Xuanzong’s annotated *Daode Jing* in Yizhou still reads ‘載’ in the traditional manner, as this stele was erected in the twentieth year of Kaiyuan (732). Later, a separate revision was made, hence the decree’s proclamation. Since the stele predates the revision, it retains the old interpretation.\n\nThe characters ‘載’ and ‘哉’ were interchangeable in ancient script. Though Xuanzong’s reading diverges sharply from antiquity, upon careful examination of the text and collation of the meaning, it remains plausible. The revised commentary finalized after Tianbao has not been transmitted to later generations. While the Kaiyuan edition survives in stone inscriptions, it does not align with the Tianbao decree. Modern scholars such as Bi Yuan (*Kaoyi*), Qian Daxin (*Qianyan Tang Jinshi Batail*), Wu Yi (*Shoutang Jinshi Ba*), and Wang Chang (*Jinshi Cuibian*), in their studies of the imperial commentary, have all been unable to verify this. Now, by comparing the decree with the stone edition, the traces of the alteration become clear. This is briefly recorded to preserve the variant reading.\"",

      "translated_text": "The character \"抱\" appears in the Fu edition and Gao Diao’s edition as \"袌.\" Bi Yuan states: \"In all versions, '袌' is uniformly written as '抱.' According to the gloss, *bao* (袌) means 'to embrace,' while *bao* (抱) is equivalent to *pou* (捊), meaning 'to grasp'—their meanings differ, so the character '袌' should be used.\" My humble note: Bi Yuan’s argument is incorrect. The *Guangyun*, under the *hao* rhyme, defines *bao* (袌) as \"the lapel of a garment,\" and further notes: \"Now used for court robes.\" This differs entirely from the meaning of *bao* (抱). In the *Daodejing*, Chapter 42 reads, \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\" Chapter 64 has \"trees of a single embrace,\" Chapter 19 states, \"Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\" and Chapter 22 says, \"Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven\"—in all these instances, the Fu Yi edition writes *bao* (袌). Bi Yuan asserts: \"Writing '抱' for '袌' is incorrect. The commonly circulated versions, including those of Heshang Gong and Wang Bi, all use '抱.'\" It is unclear on what basis Bi Yuan makes this claim. In the *Guangyun*, the character *bao* (抱) appears above *bao* (袌), with the gloss \"a bird brooding over eggs,\" suggesting that *bao* (抱) is the proper character, its meaning superior to that of *bao* (袌).\n\nLiu Shipei comments: According to the *Suwen*’s \"Discourse on Regulating Essence,\" it says, \"Draw blood from the *ying*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Stimulating Reality\" states: \"When a person serves their spirit and harms their essence-*ying* (phrase), they become deluded and seek externally (Gao You’s note mistakenly reads *yinghui* as a single term). This is to lose one’s spirit and brightness and depart from one’s dwelling.\" The *Fayan*’s \"Cultivating the Self\" says: \"The radiant soul drifts astray, the dregs sink into oblivion.\" Here, *yingpo* (营魄) corresponds to the *ying* mentioned in the *Suwen* and *Huainanzi*, and to the \"radiant soul\" in the *Fayan*. In the *Chuci*’s \"Far-Off Journey,\" it reads, \"Carrying *yingpo* to ascend afar,\" with Wang Yi’s note: \"Embracing my spirit-soul to ascend.\" He glosses *zai* (载) as *bao* (抱) and *yingpo* as \"spirit-soul,\" following Han-dynasty exegetical tradition. \"Carrying *yingpo*\" thus means to securely hold one’s spirit. *Zai* and *bao* share the same meaning.\n\nRegarding the character \"乎\" in this passage, it should follow the Heshang Gong edition and the Jinglong stele as a later interpolation; the same applies to other instances of \"乎\" below. My humble note: While Liu’s argument is sound, glossing *yingpo* as \"spirit-soul\" seems incomplete. *Po* refers to the physical form, distinct from *hun*; thus, the *Liyun* speaks of \"body and *po*,\" and the *Jiaotesheng* of \"form and *po*.\" Moreover, *hun* is yang and *qi*, while *po* is yin and form. Gao You’s note to the *Huainanzi*’s \"Sayings on Mountains\" states: \"*Po* is the yin spirit of a person; *hun* is the yang spirit.\" Wang Yi’s note to the *Chuci*’s \"Great Summons\" says: \"*Hun* is the essence of yang; *po* is the form of yin.\" Here, *yingpo* refers specifically to yin-*po*. The *Suwen*’s \"Discourse on Regulating Essence\" says, \"Draw blood from the *ying*,\" with the note: \"*Ying* governs blood, the qi of yin.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Spirit and Essence\" states: \"Illuminating *ying* to point at heaven.\" Thus, *ying* pertains to yin; it is glossed as yin, not as \"spirit.\" \"Carrying *yingpo* and embracing the One\" means using yin-*po* to guard yang-*hun*. *Bao* (embrace) is like a hen brooding over eggs; the \"One\" is *qi*, is *hun*. To embrace the One is to use the flesh-and-blood body to guard *qi* and prevent its dissipation. In this way, form unites with spirit, *po* with *hun*. Embracing the spirit in stillness, it is said: \"Can you avoid separation?\" \"Concentrate *qi* to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\"",

The *Zhuangzi*’s 'Gengsang Chu' chapter quotes Laozi as saying, *'Can you be simple? Can you be like a child?'*—precisely parallel in structure to this passage.\"\n\nScholar Qian’s note: The character *qi* (气) embodies the naive materialist thought of China’s early philosophers. Laozi’s \"concentrating *qi*\" (*zhuan qi*) is identical to the *Guanzi*’s *Neiye*’s \"gathering *qi*\" (*tuan qi*), which states, \"Gather *qi* as if divine, and the myriad things are all preserved\" (Yin’s commentary: \"*Tuan* means to bind and accumulate\"). It further says, \"This *qi* cannot be halted by force,\" and \"When the heart is still and *qi* ordered, the Dao may be attained\"—both echoing the idea of concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness. The *Xinshu Xia* and *Neiye* both quote: *\"Can you gather *qi*? Can you unify? Can you know good and ill without divination? Can you halt? Can you cease? Can you seek nothing from others and find it within yourself?\"*—parallel to the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" passage. Moreover, the preceding line quotes \"Laozi’s *Weisheng zhi jing*,\" revealing that the *Laozi* indeed incorporates the sayings of ancient physicians. Mencius’ \"when the will is unified, *qi* moves\" (with commentary: \"When the will is single-mindedly directed, *qi* is set in motion\") likewise approximates the idea of concentrating *qi*.\n\n\"Wash and purify your profound vision—can you be without blemish?\nLove others and govern the state—can you practice non-action?\nThe gates of heaven open and close—can you remain feminine?\nComprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?\"\n\nXi Tong remarks: \"*Xuan* (玄) is borrowed for *xuan* (眩). The *Xunzi*’s 'Rectifying Theory' states, 'When superiors are secretive, inferiors grow suspicious and *xuan*,' with Yang’s commentary: '*Xuan* may be read as *xuan* (眩).' This is one example. The *Wenzi*’s 'Supreme Virtue' and the *Huainanzi*’s 'Art of Rulership' both say, 'When the heart has eyes, it is *xuan* (眩).' '*Xuan lan*' thus means deluded perception. To 'wash and purify deluded perception' is to render the heart eyeless. With no eyes, the heart becomes empty, unified, and still, unobstructed by things.\" The *Huainanzi*’s 'Vast Discourses' states, \"Thus, the eye may have *ci* (疵),\" with Gao’s commentary: \"*Ci* means superfluity.\" Yan Kejun notes: \"'Love others' appears as 'love the people' in other editions. 'Can you practice non-action' is rendered 'without knowledge' in Wang Bi’s edition. 'Can you remain feminine' appears as 'without femininity' in Heshang Gong’s edition. 'Can you act without knowledge' is rendered 'without action' in Wang Bi’s edition.\" Luo Zhenyu remarks: \"'Love the people' is written as 'love others' in the Jinglong edition to avoid taboo. After 'state,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'and act without knowledge,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and British Library editions all read 'can you practice non-action.' For 'gates of heaven,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'heaven and earth.' After 'close,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'and act,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, and British Library editions all read 'can you act.' After 'comprehend,' the Dunhuang Bing edition reads 'can you practice non-action,' while the Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, Jingfu, and British Library editions all read 'can you act without knowledge.'\" Li Qiao notes: \"'Govern the state and nurture the people'—Heshang Gong’s edition writes 'nurture' as 'bring to life,' an error. 'The gates of heaven open and close'—Cheng’s commentary states, 'Heshang Gong’s edition reads \"heaven and earth open and close.\"' 'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?'—the *Huainanzi*’s 'Dao Applications' reads, 'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without relying on knowledge?'\" Yu Yue remarks: \"According to the Tang dynasty Jinglong stele: *'Love the people and govern the state—can you practice non-action? The gates of heaven open and close—can you remain feminine? Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?*'\"",

      "translated_text": "All interpretations are superior and should be followed. \"'Love the people and govern the state—can you practice non-action?'\" aligns with Confucius’ principle of \"governing through non-action.\" \"'Comprehend the four directions—can you act without knowledge?'\" corresponds to the meaning of \"knowing the white yet guarding the black.\" Wang Bi’s edition erroneously inverts these. Heshang Gong’s edition renders both phrases as \"without knowledge,\" resulting in redundancy. \"'The gates of heaven open and close—can you remain without femininity?'\" is semantically incoherent, likely a corruption influenced by the surrounding lines. Wang Bi’s commentary states: \"It speaks of the gates of heaven opening and closing—can you embody femininity? Then all things will naturally submit, and your position will be secure.\" This confirms that Wang Bi’s edition correctly reads \"can you embody femininity.\" Heshang Gong’s commentary also states: \"In cultivating the self, one should emulate the feminine, remaining tranquil and yielding,\" which likewise does not read \"without femininity.\" Thus, the \"without\" is clearly a scribal error and should be corrected according to the Jinglong edition. Qian Zhi notes: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. The Jinglong edition reads \"embody femininity,\" and the Dunhuang, Fu, and Fan editions all concur. Fan Yingyuan states: \"Both Heshang Gong’s and Su Che’s commentaries read 'embody femininity'; one variant reads 'without femininity,' but this contradicts the text’s meaning. Given that the *Daodejing* contains the line 'know its masculinity yet guard its femininity,' the logic also supports 'embody femininity.'\" Now, collating stone inscriptions such as the Xing Xuan, Jingfu, Qingyang, Panxi, and Lou Zheng editions, as well as various Wang editions like the Daozang and *Collected Tang Characters* versions, all read \"embody femininity,\" consistent with the Jinglong edition. Ji Yun’s *Juzhen* edition also notes: \"Based on Wang Bi’s commentary, 'without' should read 'embody.'\" Furthermore, Liu Weiyong’s *Collected Meanings of the Daodejing* cites Wang Bi’s edition, which aligns with the Jinglong text, except that it adds an interrogative \"乎\" after every two lines.\n\n\"Giving life and nurturing, giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating—this is called profound virtue.\" Qian Zhi notes: The two lines following \"giving life yet not possessing\" are identical to those in Chapter Two. \"Relying\" in Heshang Gong’s edition appears as \"serving,\" while the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" chapter cites \"acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating,\" matching this passage. Gu’s *Cheng* commentary states: \"Thus, in acting for the benefit of things, there is no deliberate effort to rely upon.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Great Master* commentary also reads: \"Acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating—how could one assert dominance over achievements or seek precedence over others?\" This confirms that Gu’s edition likewise reads \"relying.\" The phrase \"this is called profound virtue\" appears three times in the text; the four lines following \"giving life yet not possessing\" in Chapter Fifty-One are identical to this passage. Chapter Sixty-Five’s \"constantly knowing the model—this is called profound virtue\" is glossed by Xi Dong as: \"'Profound virtue' is akin to 'ultimate virtue,' and because it is deep and far-reaching, it is called 'profound.'\" This is likely an expression of admiration, hence the repetition is not avoided.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Rhyming Readings* groups the following rhymes: *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *wéi* (為), *cī* (雌), and *zhī* (知) (with *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes in communication; *lí* 離 rhymes with *lí* 黎, and *wéi* 為 rhymes with *wéi* 惟). *Yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), and *zǎi* (宰) rhyme (in the *zhī* 之 rhyme group; *zǎi* 宰 is pronounced *zǐ* 梓). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen group *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *zhī* (知), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知) as rhymes. Qian Zhi notes: *lí* (離) and *wéi* (為) belong to the *gē* 歌 rhyme group, while *ér* (兒), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知) belong to the *zhī* 支 rhyme group; *wéi* 為 has the ancient pronunciation *yí* 怡, demonstrating communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes. Additionally, *yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), *zǎi* (宰), and *dé* (德) form a rhyme. Xi Dong and Gao Bengshan concur. Chen Zhu groups *lí* (離), *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *zhī* (知), *cí* (雌), *wéi* (為), *zhī* (之), *yǒu* (有), *shì* (恃), *zǎi* (宰), and *dé* (德) as rhymes, suggesting not only communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 but also between *zhī* 之 and *zhī* 支. Chapter Twenty-Eight’s *cí* (雌), *xī* (溪), *lí* (離), and *ér* (兒) also demonstrate communication between *gē* 歌 and *zhī* 支 rhymes. Zhang Geng’s *Rhyming Discoveries* *General Principles* states: \"Among the Chu people, *gē* 歌 and *gē* 戈 shift to *zhī* 支, while in the Jiang-Huai region, *hán* 寒 and *huán* 桓 shift to *gē* 歌—these are systemic phonetic evolutions that cannot be altered.\" This confirms that the *Laozi* preserves many Chu dialectal pronunciations. Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Rhyme Corrections*, Volume Twenty-Five, *zhī* 支, notes: *lí* (離) has the ancient pronunciation *luó* 羅, citing this chapter of the *Laozi* and Chapter Twenty-Eight. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Horse Hooves\" chapter states: \"In harmony with non-knowing, one’s virtue does not depart,\" and the \"In the World\" chapter states: \"If one knows it, this is departure from it.\" Only then do *lí* (離) and *wéi* (為) rhyme with *zhī* (知). Jiang Yong’s *Ancient Rhyme Standards*, Level Tone, Second Division, discusses this: \"For example, the *Lesser Minister of Fate* chapter states: 'Sorrow is no sorrow than parting at birth, joy is no joy than new acquaintance.' Gu [Yanwu] misinterprets this, claiming the first line does not rhyme. Yet the *Laozi* rhymes *lí* (離) with *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *cí* (雌), *zhī* (知), and *xī* (溪), and the *Zhuangzi* twice rhymes *lí* (離) with *zhī* (知)—these are clear examples. If Laozi and Zhuangzi both alter the pronunciation of *lí* (離), would Qu Yuan’s use of *lí* (離) necessarily retain the sound *luó* 羅?\" Zhang Geng’s *Rhyming Discoveries*, First Category, cites this and adds: \"Jiang Yong’s example of *lí* (離) rhyming in the *Lesser Minister of Fate* should follow the Chu dialect. Laozi and Zhuangzi were both from Chu, hence their alignment with Chu phonology—all rhymes should be read with such distinctions.\" Deng Tingzhen states: The rhymes in this chapter exhibit considerable variation. *Lí* (離) was anciently read as *luó* 羅. The *Book of Songs*’ \"New Tower\" rhymes with *shī* 施, where *shī* 施 has the ancient pronunciation *tuō* 它; the *Yijing*’s *lí* 離 hexagram, third line, rhymes with *gē* 歌 and *jiē* 嗟, where *jiē* 嗟 has the ancient pronunciation *cuō* 磋. There is no precedent for rhyming with *zhī* 支 or *zhī* 脂 division characters. Yet this chapter rhymes with *ér* (兒), *cī* (疵), *cí* (雌), and *zhī* (知), where *cī* (疵) and *cí* (雌) share this sound, classified under the *zhī* 脂 rhyme group.",

Yang Shuda remarks: \"'无有' ('nothing') forms a complete phrase; '车之用' ('the use of the cart') is incomplete. Bi’s interpretation may be considered.\" Qian Den states: The *Kaogong Ji* says: \"A wheel has thirty spokes, symbolizing the sun and moon.\" The sun and moon meet every thirty days, and the number of spokes mirrors this. It also states: \"Where the spokes converge is called the hub.\" The *Laozi* likewise says: \"Thirty spokes share one hub—where there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\" The *Heshang Gong* explains: \"'Nothing' refers to the empty space.\" Thus, the *Kaogong Ji* commentary also states: \"For ease of turning, the use lies in having nothing.\" The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines: \"Hub: where the spokes converge.\" This means the hub’s exterior is where the spokes meet, while its hollow center accommodates the axle, enabling its use for turning (see *Che Zhi Kao* in *Qing Jingjie Xubian*, juan 216).\n\n\"Clay is kneaded to form a vessel—where there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\"\n\nJi Yun notes: All versions write \"埏,\" except the *Shiwen*, which gives \"挻.\" Luo Zhenyu states: Modern editions write \"埏,\" but the *Shiwen* includes \"挻,\" indicating Wang Bi’s version originally wrote \"挻.\" This is now corrected accordingly. The *Yuzhu* edition matches this. The *Jinglong* and Dunhuang (丙) versions write \"埏.\" Ma Xulun argues: The *Shuowen* lacks the character \"埏,\" so it should follow Wang Bi’s \"挻.\" Qian Zhi counters: \"埏\" and \"挻\" share the same meaning; no character change is necessary. The *Shuowen* defines: \"挻: to lengthen, from the hand and *yan* (extend).\" The *Zilin* states: \"'挻' means softness; today, it is written as '揉' (to knead).\" Zhu Junsheng explains: \"Any pliable material that can be stretched, shortened, bent, joined, shaped square or round is called *挻*.\" Wang Niansun adds: \"'挻' also means to harmonize. The *Laozi* reads: '挻埴以为器' ('knead clay to make vessels'). The *Heshang Gong* says: \"'挻' means to harmonize; '埴' is clay. To harmonize clay for making vessels for food and drink.\" The *Taixuan Xuanwen* states: \"With yin and yang, it harmonizes their transformations.\" Xiao Gai’s *Hanshu Xuzhuan Yinyi*, citing Shou Zhong’s commentary, says: \"'挻' means to harmonize.\" The *Huainanzi Jing Shen* reads: \"Like a potter kneading clay.\" Xiao Gai cites Xu Shen’s commentary: \"'挻' means to knead.\" The *Qice* records: \"The peach-wood figurine said to the clay effigy: 'You are soil from the west bank, kneaded into human form.'\" Gao You explains: \"'挻' means to shape.\" This meaning aligns with \"harmonize.\" From the above, \"挻\" carries the sense of kneading, but the received text consistently writes \"埏.\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* quotes the ancient *Laozi* as \"埏○,\" while the *Wenxuan Xizheng* and *Changdi Fu* commentaries cite it as \"埏.\" The *Xunzi Xing E* states: \"The potter kneads clay to make vessels,\" and later: \"The potter kneads clay to produce tiles.\" The commentary notes: \"'埏' is pronounced *shān*, meaning to strike; '埴' is sticky clay.\" The *Zhuangzi Ma Ti* reads: \"The potter said: 'I am skilled at working clay.'\" Cui (commentator) explains: \"Clay.\" Sima (commentator) adds: \"Clay suitable for making pottery.\" The meaning aligns with the *Laozi*, so this reading should be retained.\n\n\"Doors and windows are cut to form a room—where there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\"\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Jinglong* stele version concludes the chapter here.\n\n\"Thus, having gives advantage; nothingness gives use.\"\n\nYan Kejun states: All versions include the word \"故\" (\"thus\") at the start of this line. Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, Dunhuang (乙 and 丙) versions all omit \"故.\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang’s *Rhyming Analysis*, contains no rhymes. Gao Benhan: \"辐\" (spoke) and \"毂\" (hub) rhyme. Note from the *Shiwen*: \"'辐' is pronounced *fú*, a cart spoke. '毂' is pronounced *gǔ*, a cart hub.\" Gu Yanwu’s *Tang Yun Zheng*, lower even tone, *ma* rhyme: \"'车' (cart) was anciently pronounced *jū*. Wang Yinglin states: 'The ancient pronunciation of \"车\" was *jū*; the *Shuowen* first introduced the *chēzhē* reading, which became the standard from the Han onward.' Lu’s *Shiwen*, citing Wei Zhao, claims: 'Anciently, all readings were *chēzhē*; the *jū* pronunciation emerged only in the Later Han.' This is incorrect.\"",

The *Qi Fa* commentary cites: \"The five flavors spoil the palate.\" The *Zuozhuan* commentary on Duke Zhao’s twenty-fifth year reads: \"The five flavors make the mouth foul; the five colors blind the eyes; the five tones deafen the ears.\" The phrasing differs slightly. The *Zhuangzi*, \"Heaven and Earth,\" states: \"There are five ways to lose one’s nature: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, making them unhearing; third, the five odors choke the nose, congesting the sinuses; fourth, the five flavors muddy the mouth, making it diseased and spoiled; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making the nature flighty. These five are all harms to life.\" The *Huainanzi*, \"Spiritual Training,\" states: \"The five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds deafen the ears, making them unhearing; the five flavors confuse the mouth, making it spoiled and injured; preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making conduct flighty. These four are what the world uses to nourish nature, yet they are all human burdens.\" The meaning of these passages all derives from this chapter.\n\nXi Tong says: The *Guangya*, \"Explanation of Terms III,\" states: \"爽 means ruin.\" The *Chu Ci*, \"Summoning the Soul,\" reads: \"Foul and not spoiled,\" with Wang Yi’s commentary: \"In Chu, spoiled broth is called *爽*.\" Anciently, *爽* was a specific term for oral ailments, as in the *Liezi*, \"Confucius\": \"One whose mouth is about to be spoiled first distinguishes between *zi* and *mian*.\" The *Zhuangzi*, \"Heaven and Earth,\" states: \"The five flavors muddy the mouth, making it diseased and spoiled.\" The *Huainanzi*, \"Spiritual Training,\" states: \"The five flavors confuse the mouth, making it spoiled and injured.\" It is suspected that *爽* is a loan for ○, extending from the sense of loss to ruin and injury.\n\nYu Xingwu says: The characters *爽* and *丧* were anciently interchangeable in sound and meaning. In the *Book of Documents*, \"The Prince of Mi\": \"The king was in Zhou at dawn,\" where *昧* is *丧*, and *昧丧* means *昧爽*. The *Book of Songs*, \"August\": \"Receiving blessings without loss,\" means receiving blessings without *爽*. \"The five flavors make the mouth lose\" means the five flavors cause one to lose the mouth’s natural state. The *Heshang Gong* glosses *丧* as \"loss,\" which aligns perfectly with the meaning.\n\n\"Racing and hunting madden the mind\": Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yongle Dadian* reads *畋* (hunting), while the *Daoist Canon* reads *田* (field). The *Jinglong*, *Jingfu*, Dunhuang (乙 and 丙), and *Imperial Commentary* versions all read *田*. The *Songshu*, Xie Lingyun’s \"Rhapsody on Dwelling in the Mountains,\" and the *Wen Xuan* commentary on \"Seven Exhortations\" cite *田*, matching this stele. *田* is a loan for *畋*. The *Shuowen* commentary by Duan Yucai states: \"*田* is the *畋* character.\" The *Book of Changes*, \"The Army\": \"There are birds in the field,\" and the *Zhouli*, \"Field Steward\": \"For hunting and border patrols,\" with commentary: \"Hunting.\" Luo further notes: The Dunhuang versions both read *獦*, a variant of *猎* (hunting). In Luo’s scroll 乙, it appears as ○, and in 丙 as ○, as mentioned in the *Yanshi Jiaxun*, \"Evidence from Writing\": \"猎 transformed into *獦*.\" Jia Yi’s *Xinshu*, \"Lowly Position\": \"Not hunting fierce beasts but hunting field boars... is what one hunts not too small?\" Here, *獦* is a variant of *猎*.\n\nMa Qichang says: \"*行妨* (impeding conduct) means impeding agricultural affairs.\" From this, it is evident that Laozi was the progenitor of the Chinese agrarian school.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter, according to Jiang’s *Rhyming Analysis*: *盲* (blind), *聋* (deaf), *爽* (spoiled), *狂* (mad), and *妨* (impede) rhyme (Yang and Dong rhymes intermingling; *盲* pronounced *máng*, *聋* harmonized as *láng*, *爽* in level tone). *腹* (belly) and *目* (eye) rhyme (You group). Yao Wentian concurs. Deng Tingzhen omitted *聋*, which is incorrect.

Even today, some regional pronunciations retain traces of this.\"\n\nWang Niansun states: \"The character *shuǎng* (‘dull’) was anciently read like *shuāng* (‘frost’), precisely rhyming with *míng* (‘bright’), *cōng* (‘acute’), and *yáng* (‘soaring’). Thus, in the *Laozi*’s ‘The five flavors dull the mouth,’ it also rhymes with *máng* (‘blind’), *lóng* (‘deaf’), *kuáng* (‘mad’), and *fáng* (‘obstruct’). The *Zhuangzi*’s ‘Heaven and Earth’ chapter—‘The five colors confuse the eye, making it unclear; the five sounds confuse the ear, making it inacute; the five flavors muddle the mouth, making it dull; preferences and aversions agitate the mind, making the nature flighty’—is the source of the *Huainanzi*’s passage (*Reading Notes*, scroll nine).\"\n\nJiang Yougao says: \"*Shuǎng* is pronounced *shū liǎng* cut. Originally, it was only read in the level tone; not until Cao Zhi’s *Releasing Sorrow*—‘Confusing my emotional *shuǎng*’—did it rhyme with *zhǎng* and *dǎng* in the rising tone. It should be included in the Yang group. In the *Laozi*’s ‘Inspecting Desires’ chapter, ‘The five flavors dull the mouth’ rhymes with *lóng* and *kuáng* (*Tang Rhymes Four Tones Correct*, thirty-six Yang).\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"The Yang and Dong sounds are close, so Yang can rhyme with Dong. In the *Odes*, *gōng* (‘merit’), *jiāng* (‘boundary’), *bāng* (‘state’), and *gōng* (‘achievement’) share rhymes; in the *Laozi*, *lóng* (‘deaf’), *máng* (‘blind’), *shuǎng* (‘dull’), and *kuáng* (‘mad’) share rhymes; in the *Divination* chapter, *cháng* (‘long’), *míng* (‘bright’), and *tōng* (‘penetrating’) share rhymes—this is the interconnection of Dong and Yang (*Shuowen Sound Categories*, lower Yang section).\"\n\nZhang Binglin says: \"Examples of Yang shifting to Dong include the *Laozi*’s rhyming of *máng* (‘blind’), *shuǎng* (‘dull’), and *kuáng* (‘mad’) with *lóng* (‘deaf’) (*National Heritage Critique*, *Philological Records*).\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains forty-nine characters; the Dunhuang, Heshang, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan versions are identical. The Heshang version titles this ‘Inspecting Desires, Twelve’; the Wang Bi version, ‘Chapter Twelve’; and the Fan version, ‘The Five Colors, Twelve.’\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n\"Favor and disgrace are like alarm; value great calamity as you do your body. What is meant by ‘favor and disgrace’? Disgrace is inferior.\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Disgrace is inferior’—Wang Bi and Fu Yi read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is inferior.’\"\n\nLuo Zhenyu says: \"The Heshang, Jinglong, Imperial Commentary, Jingfu, and Dunhuang Bing versions all omit the two characters *ruò jīng* (‘as alarm’). The Jinglong version reads ‘disgrace is inferior’; the Jingfu version reads ‘favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’\"\n\nLi Daochun says: \"‘Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior’—some versions read ‘favor is inferior,’ which contradicts the text’s meaning.\"\n\nYu Yue says: \"The Heshang Gong version reads: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Disgrace is inferior.’ The commentary states: ‘Disgrace is inferior.’ I suspect both versions contain omissions. It should read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’ When Heshang Gong wrote his commentary, the upper phrase was not yet missing, and there must have been a corresponding note. A later copyist lost the upper phrase and thus also lost the commentary.\"\n\nChen Jingyuan and Li Daochun’s versions both read: \"What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.\" This can be used to correct the errors in other versions.\n\nLao Jian says: \"‘Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior’—the Jingfu version reads thus. Fu Yi, Fan Yingyuan, and the Kaiyuan-era Wang Bi versions all read ‘favor is inferior’ as a single phrase; the Jinglong and Heshang versions read ‘disgrace is inferior’ as a single phrase. Comparing these with the Jingfu version reveals that both are incomplete. The *Daoist Canon*, Chen Jingyuan, Li Daochun, and Kou Caizhi versions all follow the Jingfu version, also reading two phrases.\"\n\nChen [Jingyuan] says: \"The Heshang version originally read ‘favor is superior, disgrace is inferior,’ which fully accords with the text’s meaning and avoids circuitousness. Thus, the ancient Heshang version did not originally omit the upper phrase.\"\n\nNow, *chǒng rǔ* (‘favor and disgrace’) refers to the perception of favor and disgrace; *wéi shàng* (‘being superior’) and *wéi xià* (‘being inferior’) are like Chapter Sixty-One’s ‘through its stillness it is inferior’ and ‘the greater should be inferior’—all refer to the perception of inferiority. This means that regarding superiority as favor and inferiority as disgrace, both gain and loss stir the heart, and the alarm is equal. If one follows the incomplete version reading ‘favor is inferior’ and interprets it as the recipient of favor being inferior, thus alarm at gain resembling alarm at loss, this misses the point. The version reading ‘disgrace is inferior’ is even more untenable.\"\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio says: \"The old manuscript Heshang version reads: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace? Favor is superior, disgrace is inferior.’ The various Wang Bi versions read: ‘What is meant by favor and disgrace as alarm? Favor is inferior.’ However, Lu Deming only notes that ‘the Heshang version omits the two characters *ruò jīng*.’ In the current Wang Bi version, between the characters *chǒng* (‘favor’) and *wéi* (‘is’), three characters—*wéi shàng rǔ* (‘is superior, disgrace’)—are missing. The Heshang version seems to omit *ruò jīng* (‘as alarm’). Originally, the Wang Bi and Heshang versions were identical; later, the Heshang version lost *ruò jīng*, and the Wang Bi version lost *wéi shàng rǔ*. Subsequent collation of these two erroneous versions produced various discrepancies.\"\n\n\"Gain it as alarm, lose it as alarm—this is called favor and disgrace as alarm.\"\n\nXi Jian says: \"Wu Cheng’s version omits the six characters *shì wèi chǒng rǔ ruò jīng* (‘this is called favor and disgrace as alarm’); by the example of the following text, this seems correct.\"\n\nQian Jian notes: \"Lin Xiwen’s version also omits these six characters.

      "translated_text": "\"In the phrase *'shocking a hundred li'* (震驚百里), Zheng's commentary states: *'Jing* (驚) means vigilance and caution.' What does it mean to value great suffering as one values the body? The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body. If I were without a body, what suffering would I have?\"\n\nYan Kejun says: \"In *'have great suffering'* (有大患), all versions include the character *zhě* (者) at the end of the sentence; the two *wǒ* (我) characters are written as *wú* (吾) in all versions.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: \"The Jinglong and Dunhuang (Version C) texts both omit *zhě* (者). The two *wú* (吾) characters appear as *wǒ* (我) in the Jinglong and Dunhuang (Versions B and C) texts.\" Qian Jian observes: \"The character *jí* (及) is written as *gǒu* (苟) in the Fu and Fan versions.\" Fan states: \"The character *gǒu* (苟) aligns with the ancient versions of Ying Jifu and Sima Guang.\" *Jí* (及) shares the same meaning as *ruò* (若). Wang Niansun says: \"*Jí* (及) means *ruò* (若)... Laozi states: *'The reason I have great suffering is that I have a body; if I were without a body, what suffering would I have!'* This means *if I were without a body*. It also says: *'To take the world, one always does so through non-action; if there is action, it is insufficient to take the world.'* This means *if there is action*. *Jí* (及) and *ruò* (若) share the same meaning, so *jí* (及) can be glossed as *ruò* (若), and *ruò* (若) can also be glossed as *jí* (及).\" (From *Jingzhuan Shici*) Now, comparing with ancient versions, we see that *jí* (及) and *ruò* (若) are equivalent, and *jí* (及) can also be used interchangeably with *gǒu* (苟). Additionally, in the Muromachi version, a *hū* (乎) character appears after *huàn* (患).\n\nThus, one who values their body above all in the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.\n\nYan Kejun says: \"In *'Thus, value the body for the world'* (故貴身於天下), the Imperial Commentary reads *'Thus, value the body as the world'* (故貴以身為天下), matching Wang Bi’s version, while the Heshang version reads *'Thus, value the body as the world'* (故貴以身為天下者). *'May be entrusted with the world'* (若可托天下) appears as *'may be entrusted to govern the world'* (若可寄天下) in the Imperial Commentary and Wang Bi, as *'then may be entrusted to govern the world'* (則可寄於天下) in the Heshang version, and as *'then may be entrusted to govern the world'* (則可以寄天下) in the *Yongle Dadian*. *'May be entrusted to govern the world'* (若可寄天下) appears as *'then may be entrusted with the world'* (乃可以托於天下) in the Heshang version, as *'may be entrusted with the world'* (若可托天下) in Wang Bi, and as *'then may be entrusted with the world'* (乃可以托天下) in the *Dadian*.\"\n\nLiu Wendian says: \"In the *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter): *'Thus, one who values their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.'* The phrase *'body for the sake of the world'* (身於為天下) is semantically incoherent; the two *yú* (於) characters likely belong after *'entrusted'* (托) and *'govern'* (寄). The *Daodejing* (*Disgrace and Dread*, Chapter 13) reads: *'Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.'* The *Huainanzi* (*Daoist Applications* chapter) quotes Laozi as: *'One who values their body as the world cannot be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world cannot be entrusted to govern it.'* Neither instance includes *yú* (於) after the two *shēn* (身) characters.\"\n\nQian Jian observes: Liu’s argument is incorrect. While the various versions of this passage differ, the *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter) states: *\"Thus, when a noble person must reluctantly govern the world, nothing is better than non-action; through non-action, they may then secure their nature and destiny. Thus, one who values their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted to govern it.\"* Here, *yú* (於) follows both *shēn* (身) characters, and *'entrusted with the world'* (托天下) precedes *'entrusted to govern the world'* (寄天下), aligning with the Jinglong, Suzhou, and Dunhuang versions. However, the upper sentence includes an extra *wéi* (為) character, and the lower sentence includes an extra *yú* (於) character.\n\nWang Niansun says: The *Zhuangzi* originally read: *\"Thus, one who values their body for the world, one who cherishes their body for the world.\"* Here, *yú* (於) means *wéi* (為). Later readers glossed *wéi* (為) in the *Laozi* and mistakenly inserted it into the main text. The *Laozi* *Shiwen* reads: *\"Wéi (為), pronounced *yúwěi*.\"* This gloss does not include *wéi* (為), which clarifies the matter.\n\nWang Yinzhi says: *Yú* (於) means *wéi* (為) (here, *wéi* is read in the fourth tone). The *Laozi* states: *\"Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.\"* The *Zhuangzi* (*In the World of Men* chapter) reads: *\"Thus, one who values their body for the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the world may be entrusted to govern it.\"* Here, *'for the world'* (於天下) means *'as the world'* (為天下).\n\nQian Jian observes: The two Wangs’ arguments are correct. *Yú* (於) and *wéi* (為) are interchangeable. In the *Zhuangzi*, the upper sentence uses *'for the world'* (於天下), while the lower sentence uses *'as the world'* (為天下), matching the stele version exactly. The Fu and Fan versions read: *\"Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* Fan’s commentary notes *\"ancient version\"* (古本), and Chen Bixu’s citation of Wang Bi’s version aligns with Fu and Fan, suggesting this was also Wang’s ancient version.\n\nIn the *Daoist Canon*, the Song-era compilation *Collected Commentaries of Four Masters on Laozi*, citing Wang Bi, states: *\"Nothing can replace one’s body, hence it is called 'valuing.' Only thus may one be entrusted with the world. Nothing can harm one’s body, hence it is called 'cherishing.' Only thus may one be entrusted to govern the world.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "equent collation of these two erroneous versions produced various discrepancies.\"\n\n\"Gain it as alarm, lose it as alarm—this is called favor and disgrace as alarm.\"\n\nXi Jian says: \"Wu Cheng’s version omits the six characters *shì wèi chǒng rǔ ruò jīng* (‘this is called favor and disgrace as alarm’); by the example of the following text, this seems correct.\"\n\nQian Jian notes: \"Lin Xiwen’s version also omits these six characters.

      "translated_text": "The sequence *\"entrusted with the world\"* (托天下) also precedes *\"entrusted to govern the world\"* (寄天下). The Suizhou edition reads: *\"Thus, one who values their body over the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body over the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* The two Dunhuang editions read: *\"Thus, one who values their body over the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world.\"* Most versions align broadly with the *Zhuangzi*, though the Dunhuang edition is superior and should be adopted for emendation. Furthermore, these two instances of *\"ruo\"* (若) are synonymous with *\"ze\"* (则). Wang Yinzhi states: *\"'Ruo' means 'ze.' Laozi says: 'Thus, one who values their body as the world may be entrusted to govern the world; one who cherishes their body as the world may be entrusted with the world.' In the *Zhuangzi*'s 'In the World of Men' chapter, 'ruo' is uniformly written as 'ze.'\" Today, the Heshang and Dayian editions also use \"ze,\" confirming this point. Additionally, *\"cherishes their body\"* (爱以身) appears in the Guangming and Jingfu editions as *\"cherishes their body to\"* (爱身以). Wu Yun’s *Jinshi Ji of the Two Hundred Orchid Pavilion Studio* erroneously emends the Guangming edition to read *\"cherishes their body and as the world\"* (爱以身与为天下者), aligning with the Jinglong edition. Moreover, *\"as the world\"* (为天下者), Luo Zhenyu’s *Textual Criticism of the Daodejing* mistakenly emends the Jinglong edition’s *\"zhe\"* (者) to *\"yi\"* (矣), and Jiang Xichang perpetuates this error. This single example suffices to illustrate the difficulty of textual collation.\n\nFurthermore, the *Zhuangzi*'s \"Giving Away a Throne\" chapter states: *\"The world is weighty indeed, yet it does not harm one’s life—how much less other things? Only one who does not treat the world as their own may be entrusted with the world.\"* The *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s \"Valuing Impartiality\" chapter likewise says: *\"The world is a weighty thing, yet it does not harm one’s life—how much less other things? Only one who does not harm their life for the world may be entrusted with the world.\"* Both passages derive their meaning from this chapter.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nJiang Yong’s *Rhyming Analysis* finds no rhyme in this chapter. Karlgren pairs *\"shen\"* (身) and *\"huan\"* (患) as rhymes, though this is incorrect. Chen Zhu argues that the five *\"jing\"* (惊) characters, three *\"shen\"* (身) characters, and four *\"xia\"* (下) characters form rhymes. Yang Shuda counters: *\"The preceding text's 'shen' and 'jing' belong to separate sections and need not be forced into rhyme.\"*\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains seventy-eight characters; the Dunhuang edition matches it. The Wang edition has eighty-one characters, the Heshang edition eighty-four, the Fan edition eighty-five, and the Fu edition eighty-eight. The Heshang edition titles this chapter *\"Disdaining Shame, Thirteen\"* (厌耻第十三), the Wang edition *\"Chapter Thirteen\"* (十三章), and the Fan edition *\"The Chapter on Favor and Disgrace\"* (宠辱章第十三).\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n*\"Look at it and it cannot be seen—it is called 'subtle' (夷);\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called 'rare' (希).\"*\nQian notes: The Fan edition writes *\"yi\"* (夷) as *\"ji\"* (几). Fan Yingyuan states: *\"The character 'ji' is found in Sun Deng’s and Wang Bi’s ancient editions. Fu Yi says: 'Ji means hidden and without form.'\"* This citation of Fu confirms that Fu’s edition was later altered; the ancient edition also used *\"ji.\"* The character *\"ji\"* is correct and aligns with the *Yijing*'s meaning. The *Yijing*’s *Appended Judgments* speaks of *\"probing the profound and investigating the subtle\"* (极深研几) and *\"knowing the subtle is divine\"* (知几其神), where *\"ji\"* refers to *\"the incipient movement, the first sign of good fortune\"* (动之微，吉之先见者). Zheng Xuan’s commentary defines *\"ji\"* as *\"subtle\"* (微), matching Fu’s explanation. Ma Xulun argues that the cursive script for *\"ji\"* resembles that for *\"yi,\"* and their pronunciations are close, leading to the corruption of *\"ji\"* into *\"yi.\"*\n\n*\"Grasp it and it cannot be held—it is called 'elusive' (微).\"*\nQian notes: The Wang edition writes *\"tuan\"* (抟) as *\"bo\"* (搏). The *Exegesis* reads: *\"'Bo' is pronounced 'bo'; Jianwen reads it as 'boge.'\" The Suizhou and Dunhuang editions both erroneously write *\"bo.\"* Yi Shunding states: *\"'Bo' is a corruption of 'tuan.' 'Tuan' appears in the *Huainanzi*'s 'Stimulating Reality' chapter as 'tuan yuan gang rou' (抟垸刚柔). The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* cites the *Popular Explanations*: 'To form with the hands is called tuan.' The *Yijing*'s *Ganzou Degree* says: 'Look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; follow it and it cannot be grasped—hence it is called 'Change.'' The *Liezi*'s 'Heaven’s Gifts' chapter mirrors this. 'Grasp it and it cannot be held' (抟之不得) means 'follow it and it cannot be grasped' (循之不得); 'tuan' and 'xun' are phonetically close.\"* Ma Xulun adds: *\"The *Zhuangzi*'s 'Knowledge Wandered North' chapter reads 'grasp it and it cannot be held' (抟之而不得), likely following this passage, and also uses 'tuan.' The *Liezi* writes 'xun' (循), a loan for 'tun' (揗). The original text of the *Laozi* should read 'tun.' The *Shuowen* defines 'tun' as 'to rub.' The *Liji*'s 'Nei Ze' chapter reads 'follow its head' (循其首), also using 'xun' as a loan for 'tun.' Here, 'tuan' is likewise a loan for 'tun.'\"*\n\nQian notes: Yi and Ma’s arguments are sound. The *Huainanzi*'s \"The Dao in Its Original State\" chapter states: *\"Thus, look at it and its form cannot be seen; listen to it and its sound cannot be heard; follow it and its body cannot be grasped. Without form, yet forms arise; without sound, yet the five notes resound; without flavor, yet the five tastes take shape; without color, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and substance emerges from emptiness.\"* This passage directly employs the *Laozi*'s original text. The *Yijing*'s *Ganzou Degree*, the *Liezi*'s \"Heaven’s Gifts\" chapter, and the *Huainanzi*'s \"The Dao in Its Original State\" all pair *\"follow it and it cannot be grasped\"* (循之不得) with *\"look at it and it cannot be seen\"* (视之不见) and *\"listen to it and it cannot be heard\"* (听之不闻), confirming that the *Laozi*'s original text should read *\"xun\"* (循), a loan for *\"tun\"* (揗). The *Hanshu*'s \"Biography of Li Ling\" reads: *\"repeatedly followed his sword’s ring\"* (数数自循其刀环), with the commentary: *\"meaning to rub and stroke.\"*",

Lu Wenchang’s textual research argues that it should read \"绳绳\" (*shengsheng*), and since the Wang edition already writes \"绳绳,\" the He Shang Gong edition must also have written \"绳绳,\" differing from the Wang edition only in the presence or absence of the particle \"兮.\" The old manuscript of the He Shang Gong edition includes \"兮\" after \"绳绳,\" while the Lu commentary edition appears to have omitted the final \"兮.\"\n\nThis is called the formless form, the imageless image.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang Bing manuscript omits the character \"谓\" (*called*). Qian notes: The Suizhou edition concurs. Additionally, in \"无物之象\" (*the image of nothingness*), the editions of Su Che, Li Daochun, Lin Xiangyan, Wu Cheng, and Dong Sijing all write \"无象之象\" (*the imageless image*), which is superior in meaning. Gao Heng states: \"Writing '无象之象' is semantically stronger. First, '无状之状' (*formless form*) and '无象之象' (*imageless image*) follow the same syntactic structure. Second, the previous phrase already mentions '无物' (*nothingness*), so repeating '无物' here would be redundant.\" Now, considering the *Hanfeizi*’s *Explaining the Laozi*: \"People rarely see a living elephant, but when they obtain the bones of a dead elephant, they examine its diagram to imagine its living form. Thus, what people conceive in their minds is all called *image*. Though the Dao cannot be heard or seen, the sage grasps its manifest effects to perceive its form, hence the phrases *formless form* and *imageless image*.\" This serves as a third piece of evidence. The Suizhou edition writes \"像\" (*likeness*) instead of \"象\" (*image*).",

The *Guangming* edition and *Shitoku* edition reverse the two phrases, matching the *Wen Xuan*’s \"Toudasi Beiwen.\" Wu Yun states: \"The two characters '其后' (*its rear*) appear above '迎之' (*approaching it*), suggesting the two phrases are inverted.\"\n\nGrasp the ancient Dao to speak of the present’s existence.\nYan Kejun states: \"以语今之有\" (*to speak of the present’s existence*)—various editions write \"御\" (*to govern*). Ma Xianzhi notes: The *Suwen*’s \"Qi Jiaobian Dalun\" (Chapter 69) states: \"I have heard that those who speak well of Heaven must respond to man; those who speak well of the ancient must be verified in the present; those who speak well of qi must manifest in things.\" This chapter of the *Laozi* is precisely one that speaks well of qi. And \"grasp the ancient Dao to speak of the present’s existence\" is to speak of the ancient and be verified in the present. Grasping the ancient to speak of the present reveals that the Grand Scribe was one skilled in the art of history. Liu Shipei states: \"有\" (*existence*) is a loan character for \"域\" (*realm*). \"有\" (*you*) is interchangeable with \"或\" (*huo*), and \"或\" is the ancient form of \"域\" (*realm*). The *Book of Songs*’ \"Liezhu\" in the *Odes of Shang* reads: \"奄有九有\" (*encompassing the nine realms*), with the *Mao Commentary* stating: \"九域 (*nine realms*) refers to the nine provinces.\" Elsewhere, \"正域彼四方\" (*rectifying the realm of the four directions*), the *Mao Commentary* states: \"域 (*realm*) means 有 (*existence*).\" The *Guoyu*’s \"Chu Yu\" reads: \"共工氏之伯九有也\" (*Gonggong’s hegemony over the nine realms*), with Wei Zhao’s note: \"有 (*you*) means 域 (*realm*).\" Here, the character \"有\" is the same as in \"九有.\" \"有\" means \"域,\" and \"域\" is the same \"域\" as in Chapter 25’s \"域中有四大\" (*within the realm are the Four Greats*). \"御今之有\" (*governing the present’s existence*) thus means governing the present’s realm, the world, and the state. The *Book of Rites*’ \"Zhongyong\" reads: \"生乎今之世，反古之道\" (*born in the present age, one reverts to the ancient Dao*). This text’s \"今之有\" (*present’s existence*) is roughly equivalent to that \"今之世\" (*present age*).\n\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the foundation of the Dao.\nYan Kejun states: \"以知古始\" (*to know the ancient beginning*)—the *Yu zhu* edition and Wang Bi’s edition write \"能知\" (*can know*). Ma Xianzhi notes: All *Heshang Gong* editions, the *Guangming* edition, and the *Jingfu* edition write \"以知\" (*to know*). Wu Yun states: \"以知\" (*to know*)—Fu Yi’s edition writes \"能知\" (*can know*), matching this stone inscription. Ma Xianzhi notes: Fu Yi’s edition differs from the sutra pillar; Wu’s collation is incorrect. Yan Kejun states: \"是谓道已\" (*this is called the Dao’s foundation*)—the *Yu zhu* edition and *Heshang Gong* write \"道纪\" (*Dao’s discipline*), and upon careful examination, Wang Bi’s commentary also uses \"已\" (*foundation*). Ma Xianzhi notes: Writing \"纪\" (*discipline*) is correct. The character \"已\" (*foundation*) lacks meaning. The *Xiao Erya*’s \"Guangyan\" states: \"纪 (*discipline*) means 基 (*foundation*).\" \"纪\" is borrowed for \"基\" (*foundation*), so \"道纪\" (*Dao’s discipline*) means \"道基\" (*Dao’s foundation*).\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang Yong’s reading:\n- *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微), *jie* (诘), *yi* (一), *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme (脂 *zhi* department, *mei* pronounced *mi*);\n- *zhuang* (状), *xiang* (象), *huang* (恍) rhyme (阳 *yang* department, *huang* in departing tone);\n- *shou* (首), *hou* (后) rhyme (幽 *you* and 侯 *hou* departments in harmony);\n- *you* (有), *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme (之 *zhi* department).\n\nMa Xianzhi notes: *Yi* (夷)—Fan Qin’s edition writes \"几\" (*ji*), and in Jiang Yong’s \"Twenty-One Department Phonetic Series,\" *yi* (夷), *xi* (希), and *wei* (微) all belong to the 脂 *zhi* department. *Shou* (首) belongs to the 幽 *you* department, *hou* (后) to the 侯 *hou* department, with 幽 and 侯 in harmony. Yao Wentian: *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微) rhyme (五齐 *wu qi* level tone); *jie* (诘), *yi* (一) rhyme (四入 *si ru* entering tone); *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme (二月 *er yue* entering tone); *zhuang* (状), *xiang* (象), *huang* (恍) rhyme (十六庚 *shi liu geng* departing tone); *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), *you* (有) rhyme (十四○ *shi si ○* rising tone); *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme (四之 *si zhi* rising tone). The character *hou* (后) harmonizes with *hou* (侯), while *you* (有) shifts into the same rhyme. Deng Tingzhen concurs, though he does not mention *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), or *you* (有). *Jie* (诘) is pronounced *ji*, and *jie* (诘) and *yi* (一) are the entering tones of the 至 *zhi* department.\n\nXiao Tong: *Yi* (夷), *xi* (希), *wei* (微) rhyme; *jie* (诘), *yi* (一), *mei* (昧), *wu* (物) rhyme; *shou* (首), *hou* (后), *dao* (道), *you* (有), *shi* (始), *ji* (纪) rhyme. The differing divisions among scholars further demonstrate that the original text was highly harmonious. For instance, *shou* (首) and *hou* (后) rhyme, yet Gu Yanwu doubted that \"后 (*rear*) in antiquity never rhymed with 首 (*head*), and *Laozi*’s '迎之不见其首，随之不见其后' (*approaching it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its rear*) is prose, not rhymed verse\" (*Tang Yun Zheng*, Volume 14, *Hou*). This shows his ignorance of the 幽 *you* and 侯 *hou* departments’ harmony, obscuring the true face of *Laozi*’s philosophical poetry.\n\nKong Guangsen’s *Shisheng Lei* (8, *Zhi* category) states: \"In antiquity, there was no distinction between departing and entering tones.\" As corroborating evidence, he cites the *Laozi*: \"其上不皦 (*its above is not bright*), 其下不昧 (*its below is not dark*). 绳绳不可名 (*endlessly unnameable*), 复归于无物 (*returning to nothingness*).\" Jiang Yougao’s *Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng* (8, *Wu*) states: \"*Wu* (物) is pronounced *wenfu* cut. According to ancient departing tones, it should be grouped with the 未 *wei* department. The *Laozi*’s 'Zan Xuan' chapter rhymes '复归于无物' (*returning to nothingness*) with '昧' (*dark*).\" Deng Tingzhen states: \"*Mei* (昧) and *wu* (物) rhyme; characters from the 未 *wei* and 勿 *wu* series share the same ancient pronunciation. The *Shuowen* lists *hu* (曶) and *mei* (昧) consecutively. *Hu* (曶) means 'profound darkness,' while *mei* (昧) means '昧爽 (*meishuang*), dawn’s light.' Their sounds are similar, and their meanings close, hence their characters appear in sequence. Sima Xiangru’s *Fu* reads '曶爽暗昧' (*profound darkness and obscurity*), with Wei Zhao reading *hu* (曶) as *mei kui* cut—all evidence that 未 *wei* and 勿 *wu* sounds belong to the same department.\"",

According to He Shang Gong’s commentary, it seems he also wrote *Dao* (道)... The *Shiwen* confirms that *Dao* (道) is correct. The current Wang Bi edition’s *shi* (士) likely derives from the text of Chapter Sixty-Eight.

Upon hearing human sounds, it cautiously climbs trees, moving up and down in this manner, hence the term *youyu* (犹豫).\" The *Han Shu*’s \"Annals of Empress Gao\" reads, \"The plan was *youyu* (犹豫) and not yet decided,\" with Yan Shigu commenting: \"*You* is the name of an animal. The *Erya* states, '*You* resembles ○ and is skilled at climbing trees.' This animal is by nature suspicious and often dwells in mountains. Upon suddenly hearing a sound, it fears someone is coming to harm it, so it cautiously climbs a tree. After a long time with no one appearing, it dares to descend, only to climb again shortly after—repeating this behavior, hence indecision is called *youyu*. Another saying: In Longxi, a puppy is called *you*. Dogs follow people, often cautiously moving ahead, waiting for their owner. If the owner does not arrive, they return to greet them, hence the term *youyu*.\" *Youyu* is also written as *youyu* (犹与). The *Shiji*’s \"Annals of Empress Lü\" reads, \"*Youyu* (犹与) and not yet decided,\" with the *Suoyin* stating: \"*You* resembles an ape, with an upturned nose and long tail, and is by nature suspicious.\" The *Han Shu*’s \"Biography of Huo Guang\" reads, \"unable to bear *youyu* (犹与),\" with a note stating: \"*Youyu* means indecision.\" It is also written as *yin yu* (冘豫). The *Hou Han Shu*’s commentary on the \"Biography of Dou Wu\" states: \"*Yin yu* means unsettled.\" Gao You’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes it as *you yu* (由与).\nWang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi* (Volume Four, Part One) states: \"*Youyu* is a double-voiced word, akin to the *Chu Ci*’s *yiyou* (夷犹), and does not refer to an animal fearing humans and cautiously climbing trees, nor to a puppy cautiously moving ahead of its owner.\"",

      "translated_text": "Both interpretations are plausible, though Wang’s is superior.\n\nHere it speaks of one who treads winter streams as if fearing the cold, who regards the four neighbors as if dreading enemies—*you* and *yu*, hesitating and not advancing—all to depict the demeanor shaped by circumstance.\n\n\"Solemn as a guest\":\nYan Kejun notes that the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions include the characters *xi qi* (兮其) after *yan* (俨). Wang Chang states that *Heshang Gong* reads *yan xi qi ruo ke* (俨兮其若客), while Wang Bi has *yan xi qi ruo rong* (俨兮其若容). Upon examination, *ke* (客, \"guest\") rhymes with the four characters *shi* (释), *pu* (朴), *gu* (谷), and *zhuo* (浊) below; the reading *rong* (容, \"demeanor\") is incorrect. Chen Zhu states that Wang Bi’s version writes *rong* (容) for *ke* (客). Luo Zhenyu observes that the *Jingfu* edition reads *ke* (客), while the *Jinglong*, *Yinglun*, and *Yuzhu* editions all read *yan ruo ke* (俨若客). Chen Zhu further notes that Fu Yi’s edition also reads *yan ruo ke* (俨若客); the reading *ke* (客) is correct. *Ke* (客) and *shi* (释) form a rhyme. The reading *rong* (容) arises from a misreading of the preceding phrase *qiang wei zhi rong* (强为之容, \"forced demeanor\").\n\n\"Melting like ice about to dissolve\":\nYan Kejun notes that *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi read *huan xi ruo bing zhi jiang shi* (涣兮若冰之将释), with *xi* (兮) appearing in the next three phrases. Luo Zhenyu states that the *Jinglong*, *Yinglun*, and *Yuzhu* editions all read *huan ruo bing jiang shi* (涣若冰将释). Takeuchi Yoshio notes that the Dunhuang manuscript writes *zhuo* (汋) for *shi* (释). Qian Zhixi observes that the Suizhou edition also writes *zhuo* (汋). Liu Shipei states that the *Wenzi*’s \"Shang Ren\" chapter reads *huan xi qi ruo bing zhi ye* (涣兮其若冰之液). It is suspected that the *Daodejing*’s ancient text read *ye* (液, \"fluid\"). The phrase *jiang shi* (将释, \"about to dissolve\") appears to be a later gloss, which editors incorporated into the main text. Yi Shunding notes that the *Kaogong Ji*’s \"Gong Ren\" commentary reads *ye* (液) as *shi* (醳). The *Shanhaijing*’s \"Beishan Jing\" states, \"*Ye* (液) is pronounced like *yi* (悦) in *yiyi* (悦怿).\" *Shi* (醳) and *yi* (怿) both interchange with *shi* (释)... The *Gu Ming*’s \"Wang bu yi\" (王不怿) is written as *wang bu shi* (王不释) in Ma Rong’s version, serving as evidence. *Ye* (液) shares the same pronunciation and meaning as *shi* (释), hence their interchangeability. Jiang Xichang states that the *Shuowen* defines *shi* (释) as \"to dissolve\" and *ye* (液) as \"water exhausted.\" Ice may be said to dissolve but not to be \"water exhausted,\" so *shi* (释) is contextually superior. However, *shi* (释) was also borrowed as *ye* (液) in antiquity. The *Liji*’s \"Yue Ling\" reads *bing dong xiao shi* (冰冻消释), with the *Shiwen* noting, \"*Shi* (释) is originally written as *ye* (液).\" This is an example. The *Wenzi*’s *ye* (液) is a loan character, while the *Daodejing*’s *shi* (释) is the original.\n\n\"Uncarved as raw wood, turbid as muddy water, vast as a valley.\"\nYan Kejun notes that the *Yuzhu* edition reads *kuang ruo gu, hun ruo zhuo* (旷若谷，浑若浊), while *Heshang Gong* reads *kuang xi qi ruo gu, hun xi qi ruo zhuo* (旷兮其若谷，浑兮其若浊). Wang Bi’s version matches *Heshang Gong*’s, with *hun* (混) for *hun* (浑). Wang Chang states that the Xingzhou edition reads *hun ruo pu, kuang ruo gu, hun ruo zhuo* (混若朴，旷若谷，混若浊), matching this passage’s syntax; the Dunhuang edition’s *hun* (混) may be an error influenced by the following text. Wei Jiasun notes that in *zhen zhi pu* (镇之朴), the *Yuzhu* edition writes *pu* (朴), while the others write *pu* (扑). Yan Kejun’s collation of *pu* (朴), *pu sui xiao* (朴虽小), and *zhi pu* (之朴) omits the *pu* (扑) variant. He observes that wood-radical clerical script often borrows the hand radical, and Tang-era rhyme schemes were inconsistent; this final instance may be disregarded in later collations. Qian Zhixi notes that *hun* (混) and *hun* (浑) are interchangeable. The *Yuzhu*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panxi, Lou Zheng, Shitang, *Heshang Gong*, Gu Huan, Li Daochun, and Fan Yingyuan editions all write *hun* (浑).

      "translated_text": "Bi Yuan states: Gao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* notes, \"The character *bao* (保) is sometimes written as *fu* (服).\" Ma Xulun remarks: \"According to the Zhuang edition of the *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun*, *bao* (保) is written as *fu* (复); the Wang edition concurs. The *Wenzi* *Shou Ruo* chapter writes it as *fu* (服). I contend that *bao* (保), *fu* (复), and *fu* (服) are interchangeable through the *zhi* and *you* rhyme groups.\" Jiang Xichang argues: \"Though *bao* (保), *fu* (复), and *fu* (服) may be interchangeable, the Zhuang edition of the *Huainanzi* should be followed, using *fu* (复). The *Shuowen* defines *fu* (复) as 'to go and come.' Duan Yucai’s commentary on the radical states: '*Fan* (返) means to return; *huan* (还) means to revert.' Both denote going and then coming back, so *fu* (复) shares the same meaning as *fan* (返) and *huan* (还). In Chapter 40, 'Reversion is the movement of the Dao'—*fan* (反) is *fan* (返). Thus, 'One who reverts to this Dao does not desire fullness' is akin to saying 'One who returns to this Dao does not desire fullness.' Only by not being full can one remain worn yet whole.\"\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"The *Yu zhu* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能弊不新成); the *Heshang Gong* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能蔽不新成); the *Dayian* edition reads *gu neng bi bu xin cheng* (故能敝不新成). Wang Bi’s commentary explains *bi* (蔽) as 'to cover,' aligning with the *Heshang Gong* edition.\" Hong Yixuan observes: \"'The character *bi* (蔽) contrasts with *xin* (新); here, *bi* (蔽) is interchangeable with *bi* (敝). Below, 'Worn, then renewed'—the *Shiwen* writes *bi* (弊) as *bi* (蔽). In the *Analects* *Zihan*, 'worn-out quilted robe'—the *Shiwen* notes: '*Bi* (弊) is originally written as *bi* (敝).' In the *Zhuangzi* *Xiaoyaoyou*, 'Who would weary themselves thus?'—the *Shiwen* states: 'Sima Biao’s edition writes *bi* (蔽).' These characters were interchangeable in ancient script.\" Yu Yue asserts: \"*Bi* (蔽) is a loan for *bi* (敝). The Tang *Jinglong* stele writes *bi* (弊), also a loan for *bi* (敝). The *Yongle Dadian* correctly writes *bi* (敝). The three characters *bu xin cheng* (不新成) appear as *fu cheng* (复成) in the *Jinglong* stele. However, the *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun* quotes the *Laozi* as saying, 'One who adheres to this Dao does not desire fullness, thus can be worn yet not newly whole.' This matches the ancient text, though the modern edition omits the character *er* (而), leaving the meaning incomplete.\"\n\nYi Shunding proposes: \"It likely should read *gu neng bi er xin cheng* (故能蔽而新成). *Bi* (蔽) is a loan for *bi* (敝); *bu* (不) is a scribal error for *er* (而). *Bi* (敝) contrasts with *xin* (新); 'can be worn yet newly whole' echoes Chapter 22’s 'Worn, then renewed,' paralleling the earlier 'can be turbid yet clear, can be still yet arise.'\" The *Huainanzi* *Daoying Xun* reads *gu neng bi er bu xin cheng* (故能蔽而不新成), confirming the ancient text included *er* (而), while *bu* (不) was likely a later interpolation. The *Wenzi* *Shi Shou* chapter reads *shi yi bi bu xin cheng* (是以蔽不新成), also a later alteration. Some editions read *er bu cheng* (而不成) or *fu cheng* (复成), but these distort the meaning. Emendations based on conjecture are less reliable than cross-referencing the text itself.\n\nQian Jibo’s case: Qian Daxin states, \"'Thus can be covered yet not newly whole'—the stone inscription reads *neng bi fu cheng* (能弊复成), far superior to other editions.\" This is correct. The Fu edition reads *shi yi neng bi er bu cheng* (是以能敝而不成), omitting *xin* (新) and contradicting the *Laozi*’s meaning. Yi’s argument, using \"Worn, then renewed\" to support *gu neng bi er xin cheng* (故能蔽而新成), is stronger than Yu Yue’s interpretation of \"preferring wear over freshness.\" Chen Jiru’s *Laozi Jun* claims, \"To be worn yet not newly whole means unchanging, like a single day spanning a hundred years\"—utterly pedantic. In the *Zhengyi* commentary, *neng bi fu cheng* (能蔽复成) corresponds to the earlier line \"One who reverts to this Dao does not desire fullness.\" Thus, *bi er xin cheng* (蔽而新成) is less fitting than the *Jinglong*, *Suizhou*, Li Rong, and Sima Guang editions’ *bi er fu cheng* (蔽而复成), which align more closely with the *Laozi*’s meaning.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme groups, per Jiang Yong’s reading:\n- *tong*, *rong* (東部);\n- *chuan*, *lin* (文、真通韻, *chuan* rhymes with *chun*);\n- *ke*, *shi* (魚部, *shi* in *shurusheng*);\n- *pu*, *gu*, *zhuo* (侯部, *pu* as *pangmu* 旁木反, *zhuo* as *zhaimu* 宅木反).",

The character *\"du\"* (笃) appears as *\"○\"* in the *Jinglong*, *Jingfu*, Zhao Mengfu, and other versions. The *Character Dictionary* states: *\"Du* (笃), from the *Shuowen*: ‘A horse’s gait slows and falters; from *ma* (马) and phonetic *zhu* (竹).’ Commonly written as *○*.\" Additionally, the *Shitoku* version includes the particle *\"ye\"* (也) after *\"ji\"* (极) and *\"du\"* (笃).\n\nQian’s note: The *Laozi* mentions *\"xu\"* (虚, emptiness) five times, but only in Chapter Five (*\"xu er bu qu\"* 虚而不屈, \"empty yet unexhausted\") and this chapter (*\"zhi xu ji\"* 致虚极, \"attain utmost emptiness\") does it seem to carry the meaning of *\"xuwu\"* (虚无, emptiness and nothingness). The *Guangya* (*Explanations of Terms*, Volume 3) defines *\"xu\"* as *\"kong\"* (空, void). The *Western Capital Rhapsody* states: *\"There was one called the Master of Emptiness,\"* with the commentary: *\"Xu* means *wu* (无, nothingness).\" *Xu* also implies an empty cavity, hence its gloss as void or nothingness. However, the doctrine of emptiness and nothingness is a later misinterpretation derived from *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*; the *Laozi* contains no such notion. *\"Empty yet unexhausted, moving yet ever emerging\"* reflects the *Laozi*’s grasp of the *Yijing*’s principles of change, expansion, and contraction. As Shao Yong said, *\"Laozi grasped the essence of the *Yi*,\"* precisely referring to this. *\"Attaining utmost emptiness\"* aligns with holding fast to the essential and embracing the root, maintaining clarity and emptiness—akin to the *Analects*’ *\"cultivating oneself to bring peace to the people.\"* Wang Tong’s remark, *\"When clarity and emptiness prevailed, the Jin court fell into chaos—this was not Laozi’s fault,\"* refers to this very principle.\n\nAll things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\nYan Kejun notes: The Wang Bi version omits the character *\"qi\"* (其). Ji Yun states: The *Heshang Gong* commentary and other versions all include *\"qi\"* after *\"guan\"* (观). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, *Jingfu*, and British Library versions all include *\"qi\"* after *\"guan.\"* Jiang Xichang states: The *Huainanzi* (*Daoying* chapter) reads, *\"I thereby observe their return,\"* and the *Wenzi* (*Daoyuan* chapter) also includes *\"qi.\"* The Wang Bi version omits it and should be corrected accordingly. Wang Bi’s commentary—*\"observing their reversion through emptiness and stillness\"*—serves as evidence.\n\nThe teeming things,\nEach returns to its root.\nQian’s note: *\"Yun yun\"* (云云) appears as *\"yun yun\"* (芸芸) in the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions, and as *\"fan wu ○○\"* (凡物○○) in the Fu and Fan versions. The *Zhuangzi* (*Zai You* chapter), the commentary to Jiang Yan’s *\"Miscellaneous Imitations\"* in the *Wen Xuan*, and the Suizhou stele version all render it as *\"yun yun.\"* The original likely read *\"yun yun.\"* The characters *\"○\"* and *\"yun\"* are interchangeable. Gu Yewang’s *Jade Chapters* (*Yun* section) cites the *Laozi*: *\"All things teeming, returning to their root.\"* Here, *\"yun\"* denotes restlessness. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: *\"Clouds drift westward, teeming without cease through winter and summer,\"* and the *Han History* reads: *\"Those who expound teem endlessly,\"* both employing the same sense. Alternatively, *\"○\"* (from the *Jade Chapters*) is pronounced *yun* or *yun*, meaning *\"the disorder of things.\"* The *Shuowen* defines it as *\"the chaotic disorder of things,\"* which also fits. Another theory holds that *\"yun yun\"* is an abbreviation of *\"○○,\"* with Fu Yi using the original character.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nStillness is called returning to destiny;\nReturning to destiny is called constancy;\nKnowing constancy is called enlightenment.\nQian’s note: *\"Stillness is called returning to destiny\"* appears identically in the *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xun, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Wang Xizhi, Gao Bi, Zhao Mengfu, Fu, and Fan versions, as well as this stele.

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Robber Zhi\" chapter states: *\"Thus, to uphold the upright without forgetting,\"* with the *Exegesis* noting: *\"‘Forgetting’ is sometimes written as ‘recklessness.’\"* This further confirms the ancient interchangeability of *wang* (忘) and *wang* (妄). Thus, *\"reckless action brings misfortune\"* is equivalent to *\"forgetting action brings misfortune.\"*\n\nHere, *\"returning to destiny is called constancy\"* and *\"not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune\"* align with the *Yijing*’s meaning. The *Xugua Zhuan* states: *\"Returning precludes recklessness, hence it is followed by ‘Wuwang’ (No Recklessness).\"*\n\nKnowing constancy brings tolerance,\ntolerance brings impartiality,\nimpartiality brings kingship,\nkingship brings heaven,\nheaven brings the Dao,\nthe Dao brings enduringness.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Tolerance brings impartiality\"*—the *Yu zhu*, *Heshang Gong*, and Wang Bi versions write *\"nai\"* (乃) instead of *\"neng\"* (能), and the same applies to the following four lines. Additionally, *\"impartiality brings kingship\"* and the subsequent four lines appear in the Xingzhou edition as *\"impartiality brings life, life brings heaven.\"*\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio observes: The phrase *\"knowing constancy\"* is followed by a *\"yue\"* (曰) in the old manuscript of the *Heshang Gong* version and the *Guangming Chuang*, though most versions omit it. ... According to the commentary’s meaning, Wang Bi’s edition also includes *\"yue.\"*\n\n*\"Impartiality brings life\"*—in most Wang Bi editions, *\"sheng\"* (生, life) is written as *\"wang\"* (王, kingship). This has been corrected based on the Dunhuang unannotated version and the *Daozang*’s *Cijie* edition.\n\nLao Jian remarks: *\"Knowing constancy brings tolerance, tolerance brings impartiality\"*—*\"tolerance\"* (容) and *\"impartiality\"* (公) form a rhyme. *\"Heaven brings the Dao, the Dao brings enduringness\"*—*\"Dao\"* (道) and *\"enduringness\"* (久) form a rhyme. However, the two lines *\"impartiality brings kingship, kingship brings heaven\"* lack a close rhyme. The character *\"wang\"* (王, kingship) is inherently dubious. Wang Bi’s commentary on these two lines states: *\"Utterly impartial, one reaches all-pervading universality; all-pervading universality then attains unity with heaven.\"* Yet *\"all-pervading universality\"* clearly does not explicate *\"kingship.\"* The *Daozang*’s *Longxing Stele* edition reads *\"impartiality brings life, life brings heaven,\"* but *\"life\"* (生) is even more inexplicable.\n\nUpon examination, the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Heaven and Earth\" chapter states: *\"Those who grasp the Dao attain complete virtue; those with complete virtue attain complete form; those with complete form attain complete spirit; those with complete spirit embody the sage’s Dao.\"* The character *\"wang\"* (王) in these two lines is likely a corruption of *\"quan\"* (全, complete). Thus, *\"impartiality brings completeness, completeness brings heaven\"*—*\"completeness\"* (全) and *\"heaven\"* (天) form a rhyme. Wang Bi’s commentary on *\"all-pervading universality\"* is apt. Furthermore, the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Bensheng\" chapter states: *\"The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve heaven’s completeness,\"* with Gao You’s commentary: *\"‘Complete’ means ‘accordant.’\"* This supplements Wang Bi’s incomplete exegesis. The modern *\"wang\"* (王) and the stele’s *\"sheng\"* (生) are both corrupted forms of *\"quan\"* (全), with *\"sheng\"* (生) being particularly graphically similar to *\"quan\"* (全), serving as evidence of textual evolution.\n\nOne’s body does not perish in danger.\n\nQian’s note: The *Yu zhu* edition writes *\"mo\"* (殁) instead of *\"mei\"* (没), and the Fu and Fan editions also use *\"mo.\"* Lao Jian’s *Ancient Textual Study* mistakenly follows the Fu edition in writing *\"mei.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhymes, according to Jiang Yong:\n- *du* (笃) and *fu* (复) rhyme (幽 rhyme group),\n- *yun* (芸) and *gen* (根) rhyme (文 rhyme group),\n- *jing* (静) and *ming* (命) rhyme (耕 rhyme group),\n- *chang* (常), *ming* (明), *chang* (常), *xiong* (凶), *rong* (容), *gong* (公), and *wang* (王) rhyme (阳 and 东 rhyme groups in harmonized rhyme; *ming* reads *mang*, *xiong* rhymes with *xuwang*, *rong* rhymes with *wang*, *gong* rhymes with *guang*).\n\n*Dao* (道), *jiu* (久), and *dai* (殆) rhyme (之 and 幽 rhyme groups in harmonized rhyme; *dao* rhymes with *tuyi*, *jiu* reads *yi*, *dai* rhymes with *tuyi*).\n\nQian’s note: *Chang* (常), *ming* (明), and *wang* (王) belong to the 阳 rhyme group; *xiong* (凶), *rong* (容), and *gong* (公) belong to the 东 rhyme group, with 阳 and 东 in harmonized rhyme.

      "translated_text": "Thus the *Questions of Three Years* states: \"Therefore, the former kings *thereupon* established moderation and regulation.\" That is, the former kings *thereupon* established moderation and regulation for them. The *Guanzi·Kuidu* states: \"When the people’s wealth is sufficient, the ruler’s levies *thereupon* know no end.\" That is, the levies *thereupon* know no end.\n\nLater scholars, failing to grasp the meaning of *\"焉\"* (thereupon), mistakenly treated *\"信不足焉\"* (\"trust is insufficient, thereupon\") as a single phrase. Thus, they added another *\"焉\"* at the end of the following line to create parallelism, unaware of their error.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Wang’s interpretation is correct. However, while Wang recognized that the *\"焉\"* in the second line was superfluous, he did not suspect that the *\"焉\"* in the first line might also be an interpolation. The versions of the *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Lou Zheng, Panxi, Gu Huan, Gao Di, and others all omit *\"焉\"* in both lines, matching this stele.\n\n*\"By its esteemed words.\"*\nYan Kejun notes: The *Imperial Commentary* writes *\"由\"* (\"by\") as *\"犹\"* (\"still\"), the *Heshang Gong* version as *\"犹兮\"* (\"still, ah\"), and Wang Bi’s as *\"悠兮\"* (\"leisurely, ah\"). Lu Deming states: *\"悠\"* (\"leisurely\") is written as *\"由\"* (\"by\") in the versions of Sun Deng, Zhang Ping, and Du Bi, with one variant reading *\"犹\"* (\"still\").\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Imperial Commentary*, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panxi, Lou Zheng, Shichō, Gu Huan, Gao Di, Peng Si, and Fan Yingyuan all write *\"犹\"* (\"still\"). *\"由\"* (\"by\") and *\"犹\"* (\"still\") are interchangeable. The *Xunzi·Fuguo* states: *\"由* (still) will not suffice to encourage them,\" with the commentary: \"Interchangeable with *犹* (still).\" The *Chuci* reads: *\"尚由由而进之\"* (\"still hesitantly advancing\"), with the commentary: \"Meaning *犹豫* (hesitant).\" In Chapter 15 of the *Laozi*, *\"犹兮若畏四邻\"* (\"still, as if fearing the four neighbors\") aligns in meaning with the *\"由\"* (\"by\") in *\"由其贵言\"* (\"by its esteemed words\"), both conveying a sense of leisurely contemplation. Thus, writing it as *\"悠\"* (\"leisurely\") is also semantically valid.\n\n*\"Success achieved, affairs completed, the hundred clans say: ‘We are naturally thus.’\"*\nYan Kejun notes: Most versions read *\"功成\"* (\"success achieved\"), but the *Jingfu* and *Dunhuang Jia* versions read *\"成功遂事\"* (\"success achieved, affairs completed\"), which is preferable.\n\n*\"The hundred clans say: ‘We are naturally thus.’\"* The *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions include *\"皆\"* (\"all\") before *\"谓\"* (\"say\"). Fan Yingyuan’s version reads: *\"百姓皆曰我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\"). The *Zhuangzi·Gengsang Chu*, in Guo Xiang’s commentary, cites it as *\"而百姓皆谓我自尔\"* (\"and the hundred clans all say: ‘We are thus of ourselves’\"). The *Jingxun Tang* version of Fu reads: *\"百姓皆曰我不然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are not thus’\"). The *Book of Jin·Wang Tanzhi* in *\"On Abolishing Zhuangzi\"* states: *\"成功遂事，百姓皆曰我自然\"* (\"success achieved, affairs completed, the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\"), matching the text of *Kaizen’s Exegesis of the Laozi* and the *Book of Jin*.\n\nSong Xiangfeng notes: *\"百姓皆谓我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\")—the *Baihutong·Haotian* states: \"The Yellow Emperor ruled the world under the title *Ziran* (Naturally). *Ziran* means ‘solely vast and great virtue.’\" Here, *\"百姓皆谓我自然\"* (\"the hundred clans all say: ‘We are naturally thus’\") directly quotes the Yellow Emperor’s words. The following line, *\"希言自然\"* (\"sparse words are natural\"), further elaborates on *ziran* (naturalness), stating: *\"Thus, those who act in accordance with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who embody virtue are one with virtue.\"* This is the meaning of \"vast and great virtue.\" Other texts mistakenly write *\"有熊\"* (\"Youxiong\"), likely a graphical error, as *Youxiong* lacks the connotation of \"vast and great virtue.\" Moreover, the *Liezi* records the Yellow Emperor’s journey to the land of Huaxu, repeatedly stating *\"自然而已\"* (\"merely natural\"), confirming that *Ziran* (Naturally) was the Yellow Emperor’s title for ruling the world.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Song’s interpretation may not be definitive. However, since ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi have been paired, as in the *Lunheng·Ziran*: *\"Huang refers to the Yellow Emperor; Lao refers to Laozi.\"* Both the Yellow Emperor and Laozi revered *ziran* (naturalness). The *Lunheng* cites the *\"Song of Striking the Earth\"*:\n*\"The sun rises, and I work;\nThe sun sets, and I rest.\nI dig a well to drink,\nI till the fields to eat—\nWhat power does the emperor hold over me?\"*\nThis is the essence of *ziran* (naturalness), which Laozi upheld. In Chapter 25: *\"Man models himself on earth, earth on heaven, heaven on the Dao, and the Dao on ziran (naturalness).\"* In Chapter 51: *\"Nothing commands it, yet it is constantly ziran (natural).\"* In Chapter 23: *\"Sparse words are ziran (natural).\"* In Chapter 64: *\"To assist the self-transformation of the myriad things without daring to act.\"* From these passages, it is clear that Laozi’s teachings ultimately culminate in *ziran* (naturalness). Thus, the *Lunheng·Hantian* states: *\"The Dao of heaven is ziran (natural); ziran (naturalness) is non-action.\"* The *Qian’gao* states: *\"The schools of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi discuss the Dao of heaven and grasp its essence.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang’s *Rhyme Readings* groups:\n- *誉* (praise) and *侮* (disdain) as rhymes (the *yu* and *yu* rhymes intermingle; *誉* is a rising tone, *侮* rhymes with *武*),\n- *焉* (thereupon), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes (the *yuan* rhyme group).\n\nQian Zhi notes: *誉* belongs to the *yu* rhyme group, *侮* to the *yu* group, with *yu* and *yu* intermingling. Karlgren groups *信* (trust), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes. Chen Zhu groups the four *\"之\"* as rhymes, and *有* (have), *誉* (praise), *畏* (fear), *侮* (disdain) as rhymes, with *焉* (thereupon), *焉* (thereupon), *言* (words), and *然* (thus) as rhymes. *誉* is phonetically linked to *与* (with), and *与* and *以* (by) were anciently interchangeable. *侮* is linked to *每* (each), and *每* to *母* (mother).\n\nThe *Jinglong Stele* version contains 38 characters; the *Dunhuang* version matches it. The *Heshang Gong* version has 40 characters, Wang Bi’s and Fan Yingyuan’s 44, and Fu’s 47. The *Heshang Gong* titles this chapter *\"Pure Wind, Seventeenth,\"* Wang Bi’s *\"Chapter Seventeen,\"* and Fan Yingyuan’s *\"The Supreme, Chapter Seventeenth.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the great Dao declines, *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) arise.\nWhen *zhi* (wisdom) and *hui* (discernment) emerge, great falsity appears.\n\nYan Kejun notes: Most versions read *\"仁义\"* (\"benevolence and righteousness\"), while Wang Bi writes *\"智慧\"* (\"wisdom and discernment\"), with some variants as *\"慧知\"* (\"discernment and knowledge\"), which is incorrect.",

The *Zuozhuan*, *Zhao* 25th year, *Zhengyi*, and the *Shijing*, *Xiaoya Caiqi*, *Kong Yingda Zhengyi*, cite the *Laozi* with added and misordered characters, but the two characters *\"xiao ci\"* (孝慈) match this stele.\n\nWhen the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Huainanzi*, *Daoying Xun*, cites this phrase identically.

The *Shuowen* states: *\"Hun* (昏) means 'darkness at dusk,' composed of 'sun' and a reduced *di* (氐); one says it is phonetic *min* (民).\"* Duan Yucai’s *Kuangmiu* cites Dai Tong’s *Liu Shu Gu*: *\"The Tang edition of the* Shuowen *uses a reduced* min *(民), while Xu’s edition uses a reduced* shi *(氏). Chao Yuezhi said this was because the Tang tabooed* min *and changed it to* shi. *Thus, the original* Shuowen *wrote* 𣅔*, composed of 'sun' and phonetic* min *(民). The Tang edition, to avoid the taboo, reduced one stroke, hence 'composed of a reduced* min'.\"* Ding Zhongyou states: *\"Examining Han steles,* 𣅔 *is the standard character,* hun *a variant. ... The* Old Tang Book*, *Gaozong Ji*, records that in the twelfth month of Xianqing 2, the character* 𣅔 *was changed to* hun *(昏). From this, we know* 𣅔 *was altered to the variant* hun *to avoid the temple name taboo.

Yao Wentian: *\"Yi* (义) and *wei* (伪) rhyme (eleven *ma* departing tone).\" Deng Tingzhen: *\"Fei* (废) and *chu* (出) also rhyme.\" Deng states: *\"Chu* (出) in ancient pronunciation reads like *Yi Ding*’s *Chu Liu* (鼎颠趾, 利出否) *chu* (出). *Wei* (伪) in ancient pronunciation reads like *e* (讹). The* Shangshu*, *Yao Dian*, reads *ping zhe nan e* (平秩南讹), while the* Hanshu*, *Wang Mang Zhuan*, writes *nan wei* (南伪).\" Gao Buhan: *\"Fei* (废), *yi* (义), *chu* (出), and *wei* (伪) rhyme in alternating lines; *luan* (乱) and *chen* (臣) rhyme.\" Qian Zhi notes: *\"Yi* (义) in antiquity was universally pronounced *e* (俄). The* Hong Fan *reads *wu pian wu po, zun wang zhi yi* (无偏无颇，遵王之义), and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang changed *po* (颇) to *bei* (陂). His edict briefly states: *'I have pondered this phrase thrice and always found it grounded. According to the following text, all rhyme, except for* po *(颇), which truly disrupts the harmony. It should be changed to* bei *(陂).'* Wu Yu states: *'The ancient character* yi *(义) was universally pronounced* e *(俄). The* Zhouli *commentary also reads* e *(俄). Thus, the ancient* Shangshu *wrote* wu pian wu po, zun wang zhi yi *(无偏无颇，遵王之义) to rhyme with* e *(俄). Emperor Ming of Tang, taking* yi *(义) in modern pronunciation as* yi *(乂), changed* po *(颇) to* bei *(陂) to conform to modern pronunciation, and the ancient pronunciation was thus lost.' Now, evidence from the* Yi*: *'The cauldron’s handle is altered, losing its* yi *(义); the duke’s gruel is overturned—how trustworthy is that?' The* Zhongyong *states: *'Ren* (仁) *is humanity;* yi *(义) is appropriateness.' From this, we know that in this chapter of the* Laozi*,* yi *(义) should also be pronounced* e *(俄). As for* wei *(伪), the* Zhuangzi*, *Zhi Beiyou*, states: *'Ren* (仁) *can be enacted,* yi *(义) can be diminished, and ritual is mutual falsity.'* Wei *(伪) also belongs to the* ge *rhyme group, rhyming with* wei *(为) and* kui *(亏). Gu Yanwu states: *'The* Shijing *reads* min zhi e yan *(民之讹言), while the Stone Classics write* wei yan *(伪言). The* Hanshu*, *Wang Mang Zhuan*, reads* yi nan wei *(以劝南伪), and Yan Shigu notes: 'Read as* e *(讹).' Guo Pu’s* Fangyan *commentary reads* wei yan e *(伪言讹).'

The *Zhuangzi*, *Qu Qie* chapter, reads: \"Thus, abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and great thieves will cease\"; the *Zai You* chapter reads: \"Abandon sagacity, discard knowledge, and the world will be greatly ordered\"—both write \"knowledge\" (*zhi*, 知). The *Huainanzi*, *Dao Ying Xun*, cites the *Laozi* as writing \"wisdom\" (*zhi*, 智).\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion;\nAbandon skill, discard profit, and thieves and bandits will be no more.\nYan Kejun states: \"Abandon benevolence\" (*jue ren*, 绝仁) appears as \"abandon the people\" (*jue min*, 绝民) in all other versions.\nQian [Zhi] observes: The character *min* (民) is an error arising from the repetition of *min* in the surrounding text.\nThese three, being insufficient as cultural adornments, thus necessitate attachment to something else.\nWei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary includes the character *yi* (以) before \"being\" (*wei*, 为).\nLuo Zhenyu states: Neither the Jinglong nor Jingfu versions include the character *yi* (以).\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Suizhou version reads \"These three sayings are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san zhe yan wei*, 此三者言为), the Jing version \"These three are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san zhe wei*, 此三者为), and the Dunhuang version \"These three sayings are as cultural adornments\" (*ci san yan wei*, 此三言为).\nQian [Zhi] observes: The Fan version omits the character *ci* (此); the Fu version writes \"insufficient\" (*bu zu*, 不足) as \"not yet\" (*wei zu*, 未足); the Fu and Fan versions include the character *ye* (也) after \"sufficient\" (*zu*, 足). Furthermore, the *Qunshu Zhiyao*, Volume 34, cites the line \"thieves and bandits will be no more\" and immediately follows with \"as cultural adornments are insufficient, manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" omitting the eight characters \"these three\" (*ci san zhe*, 此三者) and \"thus necessitate attachment to something else\" (*gu ling you suo shu*, 故令有所属). It is suspected that these were marginal notes mistakenly incorporated into the main text.\nYu Xingwu states: Now, *wei* (为) and *wei* (伪) were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Book of Documents*, *Yao Dian*, reads \"to regulate the southern *wei* (伪)\"; the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Annals of the Five Emperors*, writes \"southern *wei* (为).\" The *Record of Rites*, *Monthly Ordinances*, reads \"do not create excessive skill,\" with a note: \"In the current *Monthly Ordinances*, 'create' (*zuo wei*, 作为) is written as 'deceitful *wei*' (*zha wei*, 诈伪).\" \"Cultural adornment\" (*wen*, 文) should be read as in the *Xunzi*, *Ruxiao*: \"select what is correct and adorn it\" (*qu shi er wen zhi ye*, 取是而文之也)—*wen* means \"to embellish.\" \"These three\" refers to sagacity and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness, skill and profit. \"With deceit, embellish what is insufficient\" (*yi wei wen bu zu*, 以伪文不足) means to use deceit to embellish what is lacking. The following lines, \"thus necessitate attachment to something else, manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" all indicate that one should not engage in deceitful embellishment. Abandon it there and attach it here—this is the original meaning of the *Laozi*.\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires.\nQian [Zhi] observes: The character *pu* (朴) in the He Shangong, Gu [Yanwu], and Fan [Yingyuan] versions matches this stele. The Wang Bi and Fu Yi versions write *pu* (朴), while the imperial commentary writes *pu* (扑).\nBi Yuan states: \"*Pu* (朴) is sometimes written as *pu* (朴)—both are the same.\"\nLiu Shipei states: Now, *si* (私) should be written as *si* (思). The *Hanfeizi*, *Jie Lao* chapter, reads: \"All virtue is gathered through non-action, completed through desirelessness, stabilized through non-thinking, and solidified through non-use.\" \"Thinking\" (*si*, 思) and \"desire\" (*yu*, 欲) are mentioned together. Furthermore, the *Wen Xuan*, Li Shan’s commentary on Xie Lingyun’s *Fangshan* poem, cites the *Laozi*: \"Reduce thinking, diminish desires.\" This is evidence that the ancient text wrote *si* (思), which explains \"reduce thinking\" here.\nQian [Zhi] observes: *Si* (私) was originally written as *si* (思). The Tang-era *Wang Zhen Lun Bing Yao Yi Shu*, the *Qiang Si Qi* version, the Song-era Chen Xianggu version, and the Yuan-era *Da De San Nian* stele at the Panxi Palace in Baoji County, Shaanxi, all write *si* (思) instead of *si* (私)—this is the evidence. Only the *Zhuangzi*, *Shan Mu* chapter, reads: \"Their people are foolish and simple, reduce selfishness, and diminish desires,\" matching this stele. The He Shangong commentary on \"reduce selfishness\" states: \"Truly without selfishness,\" which aligns with the meaning of Chapter Seven of the *Laozi*: \"Is it not because they are without selfishness that they can perfect their selfishness?\" Interpreting the *Laozi* with the *Laozi* itself, we know that Liu’s theory, while plausible, cannot be taken as definitive.\n\n**Phonology**\nFor this chapter, Jiang [Yong]’s *Rhyming Readings* groups the rhymes as follows: *bei* (倍), *ci* (慈), and *you* (有) (in the *zhi* 部, with *bei* pronounced as *pi*, and *ci* in the falling tone). *Zu* (足), *shu* (属), *pu* (朴), and *yu* (欲) rhyme (in the *hou* 部). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen concur. Gao Heng argues that the line \"Abandon learning and have no worries\" should belong to this chapter, rhyming *zu* (足), *shu* (属), *pu* (朴), *yu* (欲), and *you* (忧). Now, *you* (忧) belongs to the *you* 部, which harmonizes with the *hou* 部. Deng Tingzhen states: *Bei* (倍), *ci* (慈), and *you* (有) form a rhyme. Characters with the sounds *sheng* (声), *zi* (兹), and *you* (有) were classified under the *zhi* 部 in ancient phonology. The *Shijing*, *Zhan Ang*, reads: \"Like a merchant’s threefold profit,\" rhyming with \"women have no public affairs.\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele version contains forty-four characters; the Dunhuang version is the same. The He [Shangong], Wang [Bi], and Fan [Yingyuan] versions have forty-five characters, while the Fu [Yi] version has forty-seven. The He Shangong version titles this \"Returning to Simplicity,\" the Wang [Bi] version \"Chapter Nineteen,\" and the Fan [Yingyuan] version \"The Chapter on Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom, Nineteen.\"",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Twenty: Abandon Learning and Be Without Care\n\nYi Shunding states: The *Wenzi* cites \"Abandon learning and be without care\" above \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom,\" suggesting the ancient text was thus arranged. This aligns with the three instances of \"abandon\" sharing the same meaning. Yet in the present version, it appears above the line \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery',\" where its meaning seems misplaced.\n\nMa Xulun says: The line \"Abandon learning and be without care\" should belong to the preceding chapter. He further notes: Chao Gongwu’s *Dushu Ji* cites the Minghuang edition, which also appends \"Abandon learning and be without care\" to the end of the former Chapter Nineteen.\n\nJiang Xichang argues: Judging by the text’s logic, this line should belong to the preceding chapter, serving as the conclusion to the passage \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom, abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, abandon cunning and discard profit.\"\n\nChao Gongwu’s *Junzhai Dushu Zhi* records that the Tang-era Zhang Junxiang’s *Thirty Commentaries on the Laozi* attaches \"Abandon learning and be without care\" to the end of the \"Abandon sagacity and discard wisdom\" chapter, treating \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery'\" as a separate chapter—a division differing from other versions, yet one that should be followed. Later, Gui Youguang and Yao Nai also assigned this chapter to the preceding one, which is correct.\n\nLi Dafang states: The line \"Abandon learning and be without care\" cannot be severed and assigned to the following chapter. For the three lines—\"Manifest plainness and embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness and diminish desire, abandon learning and be without care\"—follow the preceding sentence \"These three, as literary expressions, are insufficient, hence they are given something to belong to.\" \"Manifest plainness and embrace simplicity\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning benevolence\"; \"reduce selfishness and diminish desire\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning cunning\"; and \"abandon learning and be without care\" corresponds to the two lines on \"abandoning sagacity.\" The line \"These three, as literary expressions, are insufficient\" summarizes the preceding text, while \"hence they are given something to belong to\" introduces what follows. The structure is clear, leaving no room for doubt.\n\nOnly \"yes\" and \"flattery\"—how far apart are they?\nGoodness and evil—how distant are they?\n\nWu Cheng says: Both \"yes\" (*wei*) and \"flattery\" (*a*) are responsive sounds—*wei* is upright and compliant, while *a* is devious and obsequious. \"How far apart\" (*jihe*) means they are not far removed from each other.\n\nLiu Shipei argues: *A* should be written as *he* (呵). The *Shuowen* states: \"He: to speak loudly in anger.\" The *Guangya Shigu* defines *he* as \"anger.\" The vulgar form of *he* is *he* (呵). The *Hanshu Shihuo Zhi* reads: \"Bound yet not rebuked,\" with Yan Shigu’s note: \"To reproach in anger.\" Thus, *wei* is an affirmative response, while *he* is a word of reproach. Human anger arises from what one rejects, so Laozi, to rhyme with *he* below, substitutes *he* for *fou* (否). \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery'\" thus means \"compliance and opposition.\"\n\nWu Nei Yixiong states: The Dunhuang and Suizhou versions write \"good\" (*shan*) as \"beauty\" (*mei*).\n\nYi Shunding says: The Wang Bi edition reads \"beauty and evil—how distant are they,\" matching the Fu Yi version. The commentary notes: \"Only 'yes' and 'flattery,' beauty and evil—how distant are they,\" confirming this. The current text’s \"how distant\" (*ruohe*) is not the original Wang Bi reading.\n\nJiang Xichang says: Gu Huan’s *Chengshi* commentary glosses \"compliance as beauty, opposition as evil,\" indicating Cheng wrote *mei* (beauty). In Chapter Two, \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, this is evil,\" both instances pair beauty and evil. The Fu Yi version writes *shan* (good) as *mei* (beauty), which should be followed. Here, *a*, *he*, *e* (evil), and *ruo* (distant) form a rhyme; the received texts’ \"how distant\" (*ruohe*) should be amended to \"distant how\" (*he ruo*), which should also be adopted.\n\nYan Kejun says: \"How distant are they\" (*xiang qu he ruo*)—Wang Bi may have written \"distant how\" (*ruo he*), which is incorrect.\n\nWhat people fear cannot but be feared.\n\nSun Kuang’s *Gu Jin Ben Kao Zheng* notes: \"Cannot\" (*bu ke*) is also written as \"dare not\" (*bu gan*).\n\nQian Zhi observes: The *Huainanzi Dao Ying Xun* cites the preceding two lines, matching this stele.\n\nVast and boundless, its end not yet reached!\n\nWei Jiasun says: Between \"vast\" (*mang*) and \"its\" (*qi*), the original has a blank space—either awaiting carving, an error in chapter division, or a strict adherence to line spacing. Later, between the two \"pure\" (*chun*) characters, there is also a gap, following the example of the first line on the stele’s reverse.

The *Shu Chao* (Vol. 15) cites the *Zhuangzi* with *xi* (熙) written as *xi* (嘻), while the *Chuxue Ji* (Vol. 9) and *Shiwen Leiju* (Posterior Collection, Vol. 20) both write it as *xi* (嬉). The *Yanzi Chunqiu* (Vol. 6) originally reads: \"The sage is not one to *xi* (嬉) with.\" *Xi* (熙), *xi* (嘻), and *xi* (嬉) share the same meaning; thus, \"all people *xixi* (熙熙)\" is to say all people *xixi* (嘻嘻).\n\nYan Kejun states: \"'As if partaking in a grand feast'—*lao* () is a variant character.\" The imperial commentary writes \"as if feasting (*ru xiang* 如享),\" while the *Shiwen* writes \"as if boiling (*ruo heng* 若亨),\" citing the *Heshang Gong* version as \"as if offering (*xiang* 飨).\" Qian Zhi notes: The Suizhou edition mistakenly writes \"grand minister (*da zai* 大宰)\" instead of \"grand feast (*tai lao* 太牢).\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (Vol. 3) cites the *Heshang Gong* version as \"as if feasting (*ruo xiang* 若享),\" while the *Yuzhu Baodian* (Vol. 3) cites it as \"and feasting (*er xiang* 而飨).\" Takeuchi Yoshio states: \"As if boiling a grand feast (*ruo heng tai lao* 若亨太牢)\"—the Wang Bi edition writes *heng* (亨), which Lu Deming reads as \"boiling (*peng* 烹).\" The *Heshang Gong* reads it as \"feasting (*xiang* 享)\" and further alters *heng* (亨) to *xiang* (飨). Current editions of the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions both write \"feasting (*xiang* 享).\" The *Yuzhu Baodian* (Vol. 3) cites this passage as \"feasting (*xiang* 飨),\" aligning with Lu’s citation of the *Heshang Gong* version. Thus, the single character *heng* (亨) has been variously interpreted, leading to divergent versions of the text.\n\n\"Like ascending a terrace in spring.\" Yan Kejun states: The imperial commentary and Wang Bi edition write \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台),\" while the *Heshang Gong* writes \"like ascending a spring terrace (*ru deng chun tai* 如登春台).\" Bi Yuan notes: \"Like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台)\"—the Wang Bi and Gu Huan editions both concur, as do the Tang *Minghuang* edition and the Yizhou stone inscriptions. The *Daozang* edition published in the tenth year of the Zhengtong reign (1445) of the Ming dynasty first erroneously writes \"ascending a spring terrace (*deng chun tai* 登春台),\" followed by the Lu Xisheng and Wang Zhen editions, and now all popular editions replicate this error. Additionally, Li Shan’s commentary on the *Xianju Fu* also errs in this regard.\n\nYu Yue states: The phrase \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台)\" follows the same structure as the fifteenth chapter’s \"like fording a river in winter (*ruo dong she chuan* 若冬涉川).\" The *Heshang Gong* version, \"like ascending a spring terrace (*ru deng chun tai* 如登春台),\" is incorrect. However, its commentary states: \"In spring, Yin and Yang interact, and the myriad things are stirred; ascending a terrace to observe them, one’s will is deeply moved.\" This suggests that the commentary did not originally treat \"spring terrace\" as a single phrase. The edition it relied upon must have read \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台),\" and the present transmission has merely inverted the characters.\n\nJiang Xichang states: The *Daode Zhenjing Xuande Zuan Shu* by Tang scholar Qiang Siqui cites the *Heshang Gong* version of the text as \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台),\" which precisely matches the Song *Heshang Gong* edition. Yu Yue’s assertion that the *Heshang Gong* edition must have originally read \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台)\" is correct. The *Cheng* commentary in the Gu edition states: \"And like ascending a terrace in spring (*you ru chun ri deng tai* 又如春日登台),\" indicating that Cheng also wrote \"like ascending a terrace in spring (*ru chun deng tai* 如春登台).\" ...The Wang Bi edition, *Heshang Gong* edition, and various stone inscriptions all write \"ascending a terrace in spring (*chun deng tai* 春登台).\" This appears to be the ancient version, and it seems unwarranted to arbitrarily alter it based on later editions.\n\nThe character \"like\" (*ru* 如) should follow the stele edition’s \"as if\" (*ruo* 若) to maintain parallelism with the preceding sentence.

The *Shiwen* writes \"vast\" (*kuo* 廓), citing *Heshang Gong* as \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊). Fu Yi’s edition reads \"My *po* alone, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du po xi qi wei zhao* 我獨魄兮其未兆), and the *Dayian* edition has \"I, tranquil, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo bo xi qi wei zhao* 我泊兮其未兆). Wang’s edition, citing the Xingzhou version, matches this. Lu Wenchang states: The modern text reads \"I alone, tranquil, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du bo xi qi wei zhao* 我獨泊兮其未兆), while Wang Bi’s edition writes \"vast\" (*kuo* 廓) for \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), and the Zang edition has \"fear\" (*pa* 怕). The *Shuowen* states: \"Fear (*pa* 怕) means non-action.\" The Zang edition is correct. Now Wang Bi’s edition writes \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), while the ancient editions have \"*po*\" (*po* 魄). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jingfu* and *Yinglun* editions both read \"fear\" (*pa* 怕). Hong Yixuan comments: \"I alone fear, ah, its unmanifestation\" (*wo du pa xi qi wei zhao* 我獨怕兮其未兆), with *Heshang Gong*’s annotation: \"I alone am fearfully still, without the manifest signs of quiet desires.\" Yixuan observes: The *Shuowen* defines \"fear\" (*pa* 怕) as \"non-action, from the heart, pronounced *bai*,\" its meaning derived from this. Vulgar editions write the character \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊), which is incorrect. Qian Zhi notes: The modern text’s \"tranquil\" (*bo* 泊) and \"*po*\" (*po* 魄) share a phonetic gloss. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the biography of Li Yiji, writes \"fallen and *po*\" (*luo po* 落魄) as \"fallen and tranquil\" (*luo bo* 落泊). Similarly, \"tiger *po*\" (*hu po* 虎魄) is written as \"amber\" (*hu po* 珀). The *Guoyu*, in the *Jin Yu*, states: \"Its *po* is manifest among the people,\" with Wei Zhao’s annotation: \"Manifest (*zhao* 兆) means visible.\" Here, \"my *po* unmanifested\" (*wo po wei zhao* 我魄未兆) conveys the meaning of fear in non-action. Like an infant yet to laugh.\n\nYan Kejun states: All editions read \"like an infant yet to laugh\" (*ru ying er zhi wei hai* 如嬰兒之未孩). Bi Yuan notes: *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi write \"like\" (*ru* 如) as \"as if\" (*ruo* 若). The character \"laugh\" (*hai* 咳) is written as \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) in *Heshang Gong*. The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: \"Laugh (*hai* 咳) is the seal script form of infant (*hai* 孩).\" The ancient scripts are identical. Lao Jian comments: \"Like an infant yet to laugh\" (*ru ying er zhi wei ke* 如嬰兒之未咳), the character \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) appears as \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) in the *Jinglong* and *Kaiyuan* editions. Fu, Fan, and *Jingfu* editions, along with the *Shiwen*, all write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). Fan’s annotation: \"Laugh (*ke* 咳), pronounced *he lai*. Zhang Xuanjing’s edition matches the ancient version.\" The *Jiyun* universally writes \"infant\" (*hai* 孩). Note that \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) is the ancient form of \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). Qian Zhi notes: The *Shuowen*’s section on \"child\" lacks the character \"infant\" (*hai* 孩), which appears under the \"mouth\" section for \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). The *Guangyun* defines \"infant\" (*hai* 孩) as \"a newborn child\" and \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) as \"a child’s laughter,\" both pronounced *hu lai*. The *Leipian* states: \"Infant (*hai* 孩) and laugh (*ke* 咳) are the same, meaning a child’s laughter.\" \"Infant\" (*hai* 孩) and \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳) were originally one character. Fu and Fan’s editions write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳), with identical pronunciation and meaning. The *Shiwen* includes the character \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳), indicating Wang’s edition wrote \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳). The *Jingfu* and *Shimachō* editions also write \"laugh\" (*ke* 咳).\n\nAdrift, as if with no place to return!\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* includes the characters \"ah, like\" (*xi ruo* 兮若) after \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘). Wang Bi’s edition reads \"weary, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi ruo wu suo gui* 儽儽兮若無所歸). Qian Zhi notes: Fu Yi’s edition reads \"weary, ah, its insufficiency, with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi qi bu zu yi wu suo gui* 儡儡兮其不足以無所歸), while Fan’s edition has \"weary, ah, as if insufficient, seemingly with no place to return\" (*lei lei xi qi ruo bu zu si wu suo gui* 儽儽兮其若不足似無所歸). The Suzhou and Gu Huan editions read \"stalwart, with no place to return\" (*kui wu suo gui* 魁無所歸). The *Jingfu*, *Louzheng*, *Xingxuan*, *Panxi*, and *Yinglun* editions all write \"adrift, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*cheng cheng xi ruo wu suo gui* 乘乘兮若無所歸). Zhu Junsheng states: In the *Shuowen*, \"weary\" (*lei* 儽) means \"a drooping appearance. Also said to mean lazy and slack, from *ren* 人 and *lei* 累 phonetic.\" It differs slightly from \"weary\" (*lei* 儡). The character is also written as \"weary\" (*lei* 儽), and is mistakenly written as \"○.\" The *Guangya*, in *Shigu* 2, states: \"○ means labor.\" The *Shi Xun* reads: \"○○ means fatigue.\" In the *Laozi*, \"○○, ah, as if with no place to return\" (*○○兮若無所歸*), the *Shiwen* annotates: \"Defeated, also scattered.\" *Heshang Gong*’s edition writes \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘), an error for \"drooping\" (*chui chui* 垂垂). Takeuchi Yoshio states: Wang’s edition reads \"weary, ah\" (*lei lei xi* 儽儽兮), while the old manuscript *Heshang Gong* has \"weary, ah\" (*lei lei xi* 儡儡兮), and the *Jinglong* stele writes \"adrift, ah\" (*cheng cheng xi* 乘乘兮). Since \"weary\" (*lei* 儽) and \"weary\" (*lei* 儡) share the same sound, and the *Shuowen* defines \"weary, weary\" (*lei lei* 儽儽) as \"a drooping appearance,\" it does not align with \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘) in sound or meaning. I suspect \"adrift\" (*cheng cheng* 乘乘) is a corruption of \"drooping\" (*chui chui* 垂垂). If so, *Heshang Gong*’s edition originally wrote \"weary, weary\" (*lei lei* 儡儡), and its gloss interprets it as the character \"droop\" (*chui* 垂).\n\nAll people have abundance; I alone seem lacking.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* includes the character \"yet\" (*er* 而) before \"I\" (*wo* 我). Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong* and *Imperial Commentary* editions both omit \"yet\" (*er* 而). Xi Tong states: \"Lacking\" (*yi* 遺) is borrowed for \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱), meaning inadequacy. The *Liji*, in the *Ji Yi*, reads \"and in old age, not lacking\" (*er qiong lao bu yi* 而窮老不遺), with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Lacking (*yi* 遺) is written as insufficient (*kui* 匱),\" which serves as evidence. Yu Xingwu states: \"Lacking\" (*yi* 遺) should be read as \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱). Both characters rhyme with *gui* 貴, and their sounds are close, making them interchangeable. ...The *Guangya*, in *Shigu*, states: \"Insufficient (*kui* 匱) means increase.\" Wang Niansun argues that \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱) should be \"lacking\" (*yi* 遺), as \"lacking\" has the sense of increase, while \"insufficient\" does not. The *Liji*, in the *Yue Ji*, reads \"its resources insufficient\" (*qi cai kui* 其財匱), with the *Shiwen* annotating: \"Insufficient (*kui* 匱) means lacking.\" \"All people have abundance, yet I alone seem insufficient\" (*zhong ren jie you yu er wo du ruo kui* 衆人皆有餘而我獨若匱) contrasts \"insufficient\" (*kui* 匱) with \"abundance\" (*yu* 餘) as parallel phrases. Previous interpreters have all read \"lacking\" (*yi* 遺) literally, forcing an explanation of loss.\n\nMy heart is that of a fool—so muddled.\n\nYan Kejun notes: *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi include the characters \"also, alas\" (*ye zai* 也哉) after \"heart\" (*xin* 心). For \"muddled\" (*chun chun* 純純), *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi write \"chaotic, ah\" (*dun dun xi* 沌沌兮), with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Chaotic (*dun* 沌) is also written as *tun* 忳.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yan Kejun states: Wang Bi writes \"I alone am dim-dim\" (*wú dú hūn hūn* 我独昏昏). Xi Di says: \"*Hūn hūn* 昏昏\" appears in all other editions as \"*ruò hūn* 若昏,\" but the syntax is discordant; here we follow Wang Bi’s version. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Zai You* chapter reads: \"The utmost extremity of the supreme Dao is dim and silent\" (*zhì dào zhī jí, hūn hūn mò mò* 至道之极，昏昏默默). Jiang Xichang says: Judging by the meaning of the text, the version with *hūn hūn* 昏昏 is correct. Below, Wang Bi’s commentary—\"without desire to act, muddled and unclear, as if knowing nothing\"—confirms that the ancient text of the *Laozi* read *hūn hūn* 昏昏, not *ruò hūn* 若昏. *Hūn hūn* 昏昏 is the opposite of *zhāo zhāo* 昭昭.\n\nThe common people are sharp and discerning; I alone am muddled and dull.\nJiao Hong says: \"*Zhāo zhāo* 昭昭\" and \"*chá chá* 察察\" originally appeared in the ancient text as \"*jiē zhāo zhāo* 皆昭昭\" and \"*jiē xiāo xiāo* 皆嚣嚣.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Fu [Yi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions read thus. Fan [Yingyuan] comments: \"Wang Bi’s version matches the ancient text, though later editions omit the character *jiē* 皆.\" This confirms that Wang Bi’s original text included *jiē* 皆. Furthermore, \"*mèn mèn* 闷闷\" appears in the Fu and Fan editions as \"*mǐn mǐn* 闵闵,\" with the character *ruò* 若 preceding both. Fan Yingyuan says: He Shangong and all other commentators write \"*mèn mèn* 闷闷,\" which is phonetically identical. Han Yu’s *Ancient Rhapsody* contains the line: \"Alone and sorrowful, when will it end? I rely on my writings to express myself\" (*dú mǐn mǐn qí hé yǐ xī, píng wén zhāng yǐ zì xuān* 独闵闵其曷已兮，凭文章以自宣). Examining the character *mǐn mǐn* 闵闵 here, the annotation notes: \"One version writes *mèn mèn* 闷闷,\" which precisely matches this passage. We now follow the ancient text.\n\nVast like the sea,\nYan Kejun says: The *Imperial Commentary* writes \"*hū ruò huì* 忽若晦,\" He Shangong writes \"*hū xī ruò hǎi* 忽兮若海,\" Wang Bi writes \"*dàn xī qí ruò hǎi* 澹兮其若海,\" and the *Great Encyclopedia* writes \"*piāo hū* 漂乎,\" with another version reading \"*hū xī* 忽兮.\" Qian Zhi notes: Yan Zun’s edition writes \"*hū xī ruò huì* 忽兮若晦,\" the Fu [Yi] edition writes \"*dàn xī qí ruò hǎi* 淡兮其若海,\" the Fan [Yingyuan] edition writes \"*dàn xī ruò hǎi* 澹兮若海,\" the *Imperial Commentary* and the British Library edition both write \"*hū ruò huì* 忽若晦,\" while the Guangming, Jingfu, and Muromachi editions write \"*hū xī qí ruò hǎi* 忽兮其若海.\" Li Daochun says: \"'Vague like darkness' (*hū hū ruò huì* 忽乎若晦) or 'serene like the sea' (*dàn hū qí ruò hǎi* 淡乎其若海) are incorrect.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Wang [Bi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions correctly use the character *dàn* 澹. Wang Xizhi’s edition also writes *dàn* 澹, though the stele edition mistakenly writes *dàn* 淡. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Dàn* 澹 means water swaying; it is composed of the water radical and the phonetic *zhān* 詹.\" It is entirely distinct from *dàn* 淡. \"*Hǎi* 海\" sometimes appears as \"*huì* 晦,\" a loan character for *hǎi* 海. The *Kaoling Yao* of the *Book of Documents* states: \"The word *hǎi* 海 signifies dimness and obscurity, with nothing to be seen.\" The *Shiming*’s *Explanation of Water* says: \"*Hǎi* 海 means *huì* 晦: it receives filth and turbidity, its color black and obscure.\" *Hǎi* 海 and *huì* 晦 share the same meaning. This describes the boundless, unfathomable vastness of the sea.\n\nDrifting without end.\nYan Kejun says: The *Imperial Commentary* writes \"*jì xī sì wú suǒ zhǐ* 寂兮似无所止,\" He Shangong writes \"*piāo xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 漂兮若无所止,\" the *Shiwen* cites He Shangong as writing \"*yuān xī* 渊兮,\" Wang Bi writes \"*liù xī ruò wú zhǐ* 飂兮若无止,\" and Liang Jianwen and Fu Yi write \"*piāo xī* 飘兮.\" Qian Zhi notes: The Muromachi edition concurs. He Shangong and Wang Xizhi’s editions write \"*liù xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 飂兮若无所止,\" the Guangming edition writes \"*xī ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 兮若无所止,\" the Fan edition writes \"*piāo xī sì wú suǒ zhǐ* 飘兮似无所止,\" the Imperial Library edition writes \"*jì wú suǒ yǐ* 寂无所以,\" and the British Library edition matches the *Imperial Commentary*. Sun Kuang’s *Ancient and Modern Textual Collation* states: \"'Drifting like without end' (*liù xī ruò wú zhǐ* 飂兮若无止) appears in one version as '*piāo xī ruò wú zhǐ* 漂兮若无止,' another as '*jiāo xī sì wú zhǐ* 胶兮似无止,' and another as '*jì ruò wú suǒ zhǐ* 寂若无所止.'\" The version \"*jiāo xī sì wú zhǐ* 胶兮似无止\" is unattested in any known edition; it is likely a misprint of the character *○*. Takeuchi Yoshio says: The *Tianwen Chao*’s He Shangong edition writes \"*○ xī* ○兮,\" the Guangming stele writes \"*xī* 兮,\" and the Takikawa and Shidetang editions write \"*piāo xī* 漂兮.\" The characters *○* and *○* are variant forms of *piāo* 漂, while *piāo* 漂 and *liù* 飂 are phonetically close. Wu Yun says: Wang Lanquan cites He Shangong’s edition as writing *yuān* 渊, with the note: \"The current He Shangong edition writes *piāo* 漂.\" This stele writes *○*, a character frequently found in Northern steles. Bi Yuan says: The *Zhuangzi*’s line \"deep and boundless like the sea\" (*yuān yuān hū qí ruò hǎi* 渊渊乎其若海) draws from this passage. Qian Zhi notes: \"*Piāo wú suǒ zhǐ* 漂无所止\" is the most comprehensive interpretation. Drifting like the endless wind coursing through the great void, it shares the same meaning as *liù* 飂. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Liù* 飂 means a high wind.\" The character also appears as *○*, as in the *Wu Capital Rhapsody*: \"Riding the soaring winds of *sī fēng* ○○.\" It also appears as *○*, with the *Yupian* defining it as \"the appearance of a high wind.\"\n\nAll people have their purposes; I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nYan Kejun says: \"*Yǒu yǐ* 有以\" appears in all other editions as \"*yǒu yǐ* 有已.\" \"*Wǒ dú wán* 我独顽\" in He Shangong and Wang Bi’s editions includes the character *ér* 而 before *wǒ* 我. Takeuchi Yoshio says: The Dunhuang and Jingfu editions write *yǐ* 以 as *yǐ* 已. Qian Zhi notes: \"*Yǒu yǐ* 有已\" is equivalent to \"*yǒu yǐ* 有以.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Yǐ* 已 means 'to use.'\" In clerical script, it also appears as *○*, written as *yǐ* 以. The *Guangya*’s *Explanation of Words* says: \"*Yǐ* 已 means *yě* 也.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Artificers’ Record* notes: \"*Yǐ* 已 may also be written as *yǐ* 以.\" His commentary on the *Tan Gong* chapter says: \"*Yǐ* 以 and *yǐ* 已 are originally the same character.\" The *Xunzi*’s *Fei Xiang* chapter reads: \"What is the purpose?\" (*hé yǐ yě* 何已也), with the annotation: \"Same as *yǐ* 以.\" Thus, \"*jiē yǒu yǐ* 皆有已\" here means \"*jiē yǒu yǐ* 皆有以,\" as in the *Zhuangzi*’s phrase \"there must be a reason\" (*qí bì yǒu yǐ* 其必有以).\n\nI alone differ from others, and value the nourishment of the Mother.",

      "translated_text": "Tao Hongqing states: The Fu Yi edition includes the character *yu* 欲 (\"desire\") after \"*wo du* 我独\" (\"I alone\"). According to Wang Bi’s commentary, \"*Wo du yu yi yu ren* 我独欲异于人\" (\"I alone desire to differ from others\"), the version Wang saw also contained *yu* 欲, which was later omitted in transcription. Laozi describes the essential subtleties of the Dao with fragmented and elusive expressions, often using words like *ruo* 若 (\"as if\"), *ru* 如 (\"like\"), *si* 似 (\"resembling\"), *jiang* 将 (\"about to\"), and *yu* 欲 (\"desiring\")—all conveying this same intent. Thus, the version with *yu* 欲 is superior.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Dunhuang and Suizhou editions write *du* 独 (\"alone\") as *yu* 欲 (\"desire\"). Yan Kejun states: \"*Er gui shi mu* 而贵食母\" (\"and value the nourishment of the Mother\") appears in the imperial commentary as \"*er gui qiu shi yu mu* 而贵求食于母\" (\"and value seeking nourishment from the Mother\"). Li Daochun says: \"*Er gui shi mu* 而贵食母\" is sometimes rendered as \"*er gui qiu shi yu mu* 儿贵求食于母\" (\"the child values seeking nourishment from the Mother\"), which is incorrect. Lao Jian remarks: The two characters \"*shi mu* 食母\" in the Fan edition were mistakenly altered following Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s interpolation, becoming \"*qiu shi yu mu* 求食于母.\" Xuanzong’s own note states, \"The original lacked the characters *qiu* 求 ('seek') and *yu* 于 ('from'); these are my additions,\" making it clear this was not the ancient version, yet Fan failed to correct it.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Most interpretations of this line by various scholars are erroneous; only Su Che grasped its meaning, saying: \"It is like an infant, taking no mixed nourishment, feeding only from the Mother.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Dechongfu* chapter reads, \"*Tunzi shi yu qi si mu* 豚子食于其死母\" (\"the piglet feeds from its dead mother\"), with Guo Xiang’s commentary: \"Feeding on milk.\" Thus, \"*shi mu* 食母\" here means \"feeding on milk from the Mother.\" Additionally, the Wang Xizhi edition includes *qiu* 求 (\"seek\") after *gui* 贵 (\"value\"), confirming this inscription was composed after Emperor Ming’s interpolations.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis reads:\n*E* 阿 and *he* 何 rhyme (歌 *ge* department);\n*wu* 恶 and *ruo* 若 rhyme (鱼 *yu* department; *wu* 恶 is a *wu*-entering tone, *ruo* 若 an entering tone);\n*wei* 畏 and *wei* 畏 rhyme (脂 *zhi* department);\n*zai* 哉, *xi* 熙, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme (之 *zhi* department; *zai* 哉 pronounced *zi*, *tai* 台 as *tuqi* 徒其反, *hai* 孩 as *huqi* 胡其反);\n*gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 rhyme (脂 *zhi* department);\n*hun* 昏 and *men* 闷 rhyme (文 *wen* department; *men* 闷 is level tone);\n*hai* 海, *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 rhyme (之 *zhi* department; *hai* 海 pronounced *xi* 喜).\n\nXi Diao’s analysis:\n*E* 阿, *he* 何, *wu* 恶, and *ruo* 若 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme;\n*gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 rhyme;\n*dun* 沌, *hun* 昏, and *men* 闷 rhyme;\n*hui* 晦, *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 rhyme.\n\nChen Zhu’s analysis:\n*You* 忧, *e* 阿, *he* 何, *wu* 恶, and *ruo* 若 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, *hai* 孩, *gui* 归, *yi* 遗, and *zai* 哉 rhyme.\nThe rest aligns with Xi Diao.\n\nGao Benhan’s analysis:\n*Huang* 荒 (variant *mang* 芒) and *yang* 央 rhyme;\n*xi* 熙, *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, *zhao* 兆, *hai* 孩, *gui* 归, *yi* 遗, and *zai* 哉 form one rhyme group, while *gui* 归 and *yi* 遗 also rhyme independently.\nAdditionally, *hun* 昏, *men* 闷 (variant *min* 闵), *hai* 海 (variant *hui* 晦), *zhi* 止, *yi* 以, *bi* 鄙, and *mu* 母 form another rhyme group.\n\nYang Shuda states: Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis is correct; Xi, Chen, and Gao all err.\n\nDeng Tingzhen notes: *Wu* 恶 and *ruo* 若 rhyme. In ancient pronunciation, both *shanwu* 善恶 (\"good and evil\") and *haowu* 好恶 (\"likes and dislikes\") used the departing tone for *wu* 恶; later generations forcibly distinguished *wu* 恶 in *shanwu* 善恶 as an entering tone. The character *ruo* 若 rhymes with *fu* 赋 in the *Shijing*’s *Zheng Min*, and with *shuo* 硕 in *Da Tian* and *Bi Gong*; *shuo* 硕 in ancient pronunciation rhymed with *zhe* 柘. In *Sheng Min*, *zhe* 柘 rhymes with *lu* 路, while in the *Daxue*, *shuo* 硕 rhymes with *wu* 恶. In *Bi Gong*, *ruo* 若 further rhymes with *zuo* 作, and *zuo* 作 in ancient pronunciation aligned with *zuo* 祚 and *zuo* 胙. Cross-referencing these, *ruo* 若 broadly belongs to the departing tone of the *yu* 鱼 and *yu* 虞 departments, though its modern pronunciation has shifted from the departing tone.\n\nJiang Yougao states: *Men* 闷 is pronounced *mokun* 莫困切. However, in ancient times, it had a level tone and should be grouped with the *hun* 魂 department. In Laozi’s *Yi Su* chapter, \"*Wo du menmen* 我独闷闷\" (\"I alone am content\") rhymes with *hun* 昏. In the *Shun Hua* chapter, \"*Qi zheng menmen* 其政闷闷\" (\"its governance is unadorned\") rhymes with *chun* 醇 (see *Tang Yun Sisheng Zheng*, volume 26, *hun* 慁).\n\nAnother theory from Jiang Yougao holds that *lao* 牢 is not part of the rhyme.\n\nQian Zhi notes: *Lao* 牢 in ancient pronunciation was read as *li* 厘. Jiang Yong’s *Guyun Biaozhun* (Level Tone, Section 11) states: \"*Lao* 牢 is pronounced *langhou* 郎侯切. According to ancient pronunciation, *lao* 牢 was thus, as the *Shiming* explains: '*Liu* 留 means *lao* 牢.' Laozi’s line, '*Zhongren xixi, ru lao tai lao, ru deng chuntai* 众人熙熙，如○太牢，如登春台' ('The multitude are merry, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace'), and Zhuang Xin’s citation of the proverb, '*Wang yang er bu lao, wei wei chi ye* 亡羊而补牢，未为迟也' ('Losing a sheep and mending the pen is not too late'), both read *lao* 牢 as *li* 厘—likely a dialectal variation.\"\n\nAdditionally, *tai* 台 was anciently read as *chi* 持. The *Shiming* states: \"*Tai* 台 means *chi* 持.\" The character *tai* 台 derives from the phonetic *ㄓ*, hence its proximity to *chi* 持. *Hai* 孩 is pronounced *huli* 户黎切, so *lao* 牢, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 form a rhyme, as do *lao* 牢 and *zhao* 兆.\n\nMa Xulun states: \"*Xi* 熙, *tai* 台, and *hai* 孩 rhyme at the ends of lines, a point previous scholars have clarified.

      "translated_text": "Qian's note: The character *wei* 唯 appears as *wei* 惟 in various Wang Bi editions, and as *wei* 唯 in the Daozang Wang Bi edition. *Kong* 孔 means \"intense\" or \"great.\" The *Book of Documents* reads *liu fu kong xiu* 六府孔修 (\"the six treasuries are greatly cultivated\"), while the *Records of the Grand Historian* renders it *shen xiu* 甚修 (\"intensely cultivated\"). *Shen* 甚 carries the sense of \"abundant,\" so *kong de* 孔德 may be understood as *sheng de* 盛德 (\"abundant virtue\"). Thus, this line speaks of the demeanor of abundant virtue, which follows only the embodiment of the Dao.\n\nAs a thing, the Dao is only dim and indistinct. Within the dim and indistinct, there are images; within the indistinct and dim, there are things.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The line *hu huang zhong you xiang, huang hu zhong you wu* 忽恍中有象，恍忽中有物 (\"within the indistinct and dim, there are images; within the dim and indistinct, there are things\") is identical in Gu Huan's edition. The imperial commentary reads: *Hu xi huang, qi zhong you ○; huang xi hu, qi zhong you wu* 忽兮恍，其中有○；恍兮忽，其中有物 (\"Dim, ah indistinct—within it, there is ○; indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"). The Heshang Gong edition reads: *Hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang; huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu* 忽兮恍兮，其中有像；怳兮忽兮，其中有物 (\"Dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images; indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"). Some versions invert these two lines. Wang Bi's edition matches the Heshang Gong, with *hu* 忽 written as *hu* 惚. Qian's note: In the Daozang Wang Bi edition, both instances of *hu xi* 惚兮 are written as *hu xi* 忽兮. The *Shiwen* glosses the character *huang* 怳, indicating that the Wang Bi edition originally wrote *huang* 怳. The commentary on the *Toutuo Temple Stele* cites the *Laozi* as writing *huang* 怳, and Wang Bi's commentary also uses *huang* 怳. The *Baopuzi*, in its \"Dizhen\" chapter, quotes the \"Old Master\" in a manner identical to the Heshang Gong edition. The British Library manuscript matches the imperial commentary. Additionally, the Dunhuang edition writes *wei huang* 惟恍 as *wei huang* 惟慌. The *Guangya* (*Shigu* 2) defines ○ as *hu* 忽 (\"sudden\"). The preface to the *Shennü Fu* reads *jingshen huanghu* 精神怳惚 (\"spirit dim and indistinct\"), with the commentary: \"the sense of being unaware of oneself.\" The *Xu Yiqie Jing Yinyi* cites the *Zilin*: *huanghu* 恍惚 means \"the mind is unclear.\" In the Fu Yi and Fan editions, these two characters are written as *mangwu* 芒芴, which were interchangeable in ancient times. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Zhile\") also reads: *Mang hu wu hu, er wu cong chu hu? Wu hu mang hu, er wu you xiang hu?* 芒乎芴乎，而无从出乎？芴乎芒乎，而无有象乎？ (\"Dim, ah indistinct—how can one emerge from it? Indistinct, ah dim—how can there be images within it?\") and *za hu mangwu zhi jian* 杂乎芒芴之间 (\"intermingled within the dim and indistinct\"). These phrases all derive from this passage. Chu Boshi states: *Mangwu* 芒芴 is read identically to *huanghu* 恍惚. The *Guang Hongming Ji* (13), in Shi Falin's *Bianzheng Lun Jiuzhen Pian*, cites *mangwu* 芒芴 as correctly written *huanghu* 恍惚. Yu Yue remarks: The two lines *hu xi huang xi* 惚兮恍兮 and *huang xi hu xi* 恍兮惚兮 should follow the two lines *huang xi hu xi* 恍兮惚兮. This is because they continue the preceding *wei huang wei hu* 惟恍惟惚 (\"only dim and indistinct\"), so one should first say *huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu* 恍兮惚兮，其中有物 (\"indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things\"), rhyming with the four lines above: *Dao zhi wei wu, wei huang wei hu* 道之为物，惟恍惟惚 (\"As a thing, the Dao is only dim and indistinct\"). The subsequent line, *hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang* 惚兮恍兮，其中有象 (\"dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images\"), then shifts the rhyme. Wang Bi's commentary reads: \"The myriad things begin and are completed, yet one does not know how this occurs. Thus it is said: indistinct, ah dim—dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images.\" The commentary likely quotes the entire passage but omits the four characters *qi zhong you wu* 其中有物 (\"within it, there are things\"). Nevertheless, this demonstrates that the version Wang Bi saw had not yet inverted the lines.\n\nJiang Xichang remarks: According to the *Qiang Ben Cheng Shu*, the quoted passage reads: *Huanghu zhong you xiang, huhuang zhong you wu* 恍惚中有象，惚恍中有物 (\"within the indistinct and dim, there are images; within the dim and indistinct, there are things\"). The Daozang Heshang Gong edition reads: *Huang xi hu xi, qi zhong you wu; hu xi huang xi, qi zhong you xiang* 怳兮忽兮，其中有物；忽兮怳兮，其中有像 (\"indistinct, ah dim—within it, there are things; dim, ah indistinct—within it, there are images\"), which aligns with Yu Yue's proposal.\n\nWithin the profound darkness, there is essence; this essence is most true, and within it, there is reliability.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The line *○ ming zhong you jing* ○冥中有精 (\"within the profound darkness, there is essence\") is identical in Gu Huan's edition. The imperial commentary reads *○ xi ming, qi zhong you jing* ○兮冥，其中有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"), while the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions read *○ xi ming xi, qi zhong you jing* ○兮冥兮，其中有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). Luo Zhenyu notes: In the imperial commentary, *zhen* 真 is written as ○, a variant character for *zhen* 真. Qian's note: The *Huainanzi* (\"Daoying Xun\") cites these four lines identically to the Wang Bi edition. The *Wen Xuan* (commentary on Shen Yue's \"Zhongshan Shi\") cites *○ xi ming, zhong qi you jing* ○兮冥，中其有精 (\"profound, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The Lou Zheng and Panxi editions read *yao xi ming, qi zhong you jing* 杳兮冥，其中有精 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The Guancang edition reads *○ ming zhong you jing* ○冥中有精 (\"within the profound darkness, there is essence\"). The Fu Yi edition reads *you xi ming xi, qi zhong you jing* 幽兮冥兮，其中有精 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"), and the Fan edition reads *you xi ming xi, zhong you jing xi* 幽兮冥兮，中有精兮 (\"remote, ah dark—within it, there is essence\"). The characters ○, *you* 幽, and *yao* 杳 are phonetically close and interchangeable. Additionally, the line *qi jing shen zhen* 其精甚真 (\"this essence is most true\") appears in Wang Xizhi's edition as *you jing shen zhen* 有精甚真 (\"there is essence, most true\"). This line is absent in the Suizhou edition.\n\nQian's note: The *Guanzi* (\"Neiye\") states: \"Essence is the utmost of *qi*; essence is the purest of *qi*. In all human life, Heaven bestows its essence.\" This aligns with the meaning of *jing* 精 (\"essence\") in this chapter. *Jing* reflects an ancient, naive materialist conception, as discussed in detail in Feng Youlan's essay \"The Material Nature of the Dao in Pre-Qin Daoism.\" The *Zhuangzi* (\"Dechong Fu\") reads *fu Dao you qing you xin, wu wei wu xing, ke zhuan er bu ke shou, ke de er bu ke jian* 夫道有情有信，无为无形，可传而不可受，可得而不可见 (\"The Dao has *qing* and reliability, is without action and formless, can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen\"). Here, *qing* 情 should be *jing* 精 (\"essence\"), so *you qing you xin* 有情有信 (\"has *qing* and reliability\") corresponds to *qi zhong you jing, qi zhong you xin* 其中有精，其中有信 (\"within it, there is essence; within it, there is reliability\").\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.\n\nWu Yun states: The Fu Yi edition reads *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古 (\"from the present to ancient times\"), and the Wang Bi edition matches this stele. Fan Yingyuan remarks: The line *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古 (\"from the present to ancient times\") is identical in the editions of Yan Zun and Wang Bi. Ma Xulun notes: Most editions read *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 (\"from ancient times to the present\"), which is incorrect. *Gu* 古, *qu* 去, and *fu* 甫 rhyme. Fan claims \"Wang Bi matches the ancient edition,\" yet in Wang Bi's commentary, both instances read *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 (\"from ancient times to the present\"). This is likely because later editors altered the text based on other editions, affecting both the base text and Wang Bi's commentary.",

      "translated_text": "Jiang Xichang states: According to the *Collected Commentaries on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue* (including annotations by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, and Wang Pang), Wang Bi’s commentary reads: “Thus it is said, ‘From the present to ancient times, its name does not depart.’” This precisely aligns with Fan Yingyuan’s version of Wang Bi’s text, sufficiently proving that the current edition has been altered by later hands—Ma Xulun’s argument is correct.\n\n\"To encompass the many progenitors.\"\n\"How do I know the nature of the many progenitors? By this.\"\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Dunhuang, Jing, and Sui editions write *zhong* 众 (\"many\") as *zhong* 终 (\"end\"), as *zhong* and *zhong* were homophonous in ancient pronunciation.\nQian Zhi notes: The Jinglong edition writes *zhong* 众 and not *zhong* 终—this is an erroneous collation. The Palace Library edition also writes *zhong* 终. However, *zhong* 终 is incorrect.\n\nThe character *yue* 阅 in ancient texts glosses as \"to gather\" or \"to total.\" Ōta Seiken cites the *Liezi* (\"Zhongni\" chapter): \"He gathered forty disciples to travel together.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Yuandao Xun\") states: \"The totality of the myriad things all passes through one aperture; the roots of the hundred affairs all emerge from one gate.\" The *Chuzhen Xun* reads: \"What heaven covers, what earth bears, what the six directions enclose, what yin and yang exhale, what rain and dew moisten, what the Dao and virtue sustain—all these are born of one father and mother and encompassed in one harmony.\" Gao You’s commentary: \"*Yue* 阅 means ‘to total.’\" Only Ōta argues that *zhongfu* 众甫 refers to \"many fathers,\" citing the *Zhuangzi* (\"Tiandi\" chapter), where Nie Que states: \"There are clans and ancestors; one may be a father to many, but not the father of fathers.\" He claims that in ancient texts, *fu* 甫 and *fu* 父 were interchangeable. Though his view aligns with Yu Yue’s, it is highly forced.\n\nExamining classical texts, *fu* 甫 consistently glosses as \"great.\" Derivative characters from *fu* all carry the meaning of \"great.\" For instance, the *Xunzi* (\"Rongru\" chapter) annotates *bo* 薄 as \"broad and great in appearance\"; the *Han Shi Waizhuan* (\"Changwu\") glosses *fu* 敷 as \"great\"; the *Shuowen* defines *bo* 博 as \"greatly penetrating\"; the *Book of Songs* (\"Beishan\") annotates *pu* 溥 (via Mao’s commentary) as \"great\"; the *Book of Songs* (\"Chegong\") annotates *pu* 圃 (via Mao’s commentary) as \"broad\"; the *Shuowen* defines *pu* 酺 as \"the king’s virtue spreading widely in grand feasting\" and *pu* 誧 as \"grand speech\" (see Dai Zongxiang’s *Shi Fu*). From this, *zhongfu* 众甫 clearly means \"the many great ones.\" Within the realm, there are the Four Greats—\"to encompass the many progenitors\" thus means to total the Four Greats.\n\nYan Kejun states: The phrase *zhi ran* 之然 appears in the imperial commentary and the modern Heshang Gong edition as *zhi ran zai* 之然哉, while Wang Bi’s edition reads *zhi zhuang zai* 之状哉. The *Shiwen* notes: \"One version of Heshang Gong’s text simply reads, ‘How do I know?’\"\nWu Yun states: The phrase *wu he yi zhi* 吾何以知 appears in the Fu Yi edition as *xi yi zhi* 奚以知.\nFan Yingyuan states: The character *xi* 奚 is from the ancient edition.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, per Jiang Yong’s analysis:\n- *Rong* 容 rhymes with *cong* 从 (East Division).\n- *Wu* 物 rhymes with *hu* 惚 (Zhi Division; *hu*, pronounced *hujie*).\n- *Huang* 恍 rhymes with *xiang* 象 (Yang Division).\n- *Hu* 忽 rhymes with *wu* 物 (Zhi Division).\n- *Ming* 冥 rhymes with *jing* 精 (Geng Division).\n- *Zhen* 真 rhymes with *xin* 信 (Zhen Division; *xin*, level tone).\n- *Qu* 去 rhymes with *fu* 甫 (Yu Division).\n\nYao Wentian, Deng Tingzhen, and Xi Tong concur. Bernhard Karlgren reads *zi gu ji jin* 自古及今 as *zi jin ji gu* 自今及古, rhyming *gu* 古, *qu* 去, and *fu* 甫. Additionally, *ming* 冥, *jing* 精, *zhen* 真, and *xin* 信 form a paired rhyme. Wei Jiangong notes that these four lines should be examined for their potential rhyme, just as *ming* 名 rhymes with *men* 门 and *ying* 盈 rhymes with *chen* 尘 (see *Studies on Ancient Phonological Systems*).\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains sixty-one characters, matching the Dunhuang edition. The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan editions contain seventy-one characters. Heshang Gong titles this chapter \"Emptying the Heart, Twenty-One,\" Wang Bi titles it \"Chapter Twenty-One,\" and Fan Yingyuan titles it \"The Countenance of the Power of Emptiness, Twenty-One.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n\"Bent, then whole; crooked, then upright.\"\nYan Kejun states: The phrase *wang ze zheng* 枉则正 appears identically in the Fu Yi edition, while other editions read *ze zhi* 则直.\nQian Zhi notes: The Sui Prefecture, Palace Library, and Fan Yingyuan editions all read *zheng* 正. Fan states: \"The character *zheng* 正 aligns with Wang Bi’s ancient edition; one version reads *zhi* 直.\"\nTakeuchi Yoshio states: The Jing and Sui editions write *zhi* 直 as *zheng* 正, matching the *Huainanzi* (\"Daoying Xun\"). However, the *Daoying Xun* actually cites the two lines as *zhi* 直—Takeuchi’s collation is incorrect.\n\nMoreover, \"bent, then whole\" echoes the *Zhuangzi* (\"Tianxia\" chapter), which describes Lao Dan’s Dao: \"All seek fortune, yet he alone bends to preserve wholeness.\" The *Hongfan* states, \"Wood is said to be bent and straight\"—this also uses wood as a metaphor. \"Bent\" refers to what the *Zhuangzi* (\"Xiaoyaoyou\" chapter) calls \"curled and not fitting the compass or square,\" and what the *Renjianshi* chapter calls \"clenched and unfit for beams or pillars.\" As the saying goes, \"Straight trees are felled first; sweet wells run dry first,\" and \"I walk in curves, sparing my feet\"—this embodies the meaning of \"bent, then whole.\"\n\n\"Crooked, then upright\": *Wang* 枉, per the *Shuowen*, means \"twisted and bent, from *mu* 木 and *qu* ○ phonetic.\" The *Guangya* (\"Shigu\" 1) glosses *qu* ○ as \"bent,\" meaning \"contorted and bowed\"—essentially \"yielding.\" *Zheng* 正 in other editions reads *zhi* 直; *wang* 枉 and *zhi* 直 form a parallel. \"Crooked, then straight\" means \"great straightness appears bent.\" The *Analects* states, \"Elevate the straight and set them above the crooked.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Benjing Xun\") reads, \"Correct the crooked to make it straight.\" The stele text reads *zheng* 正, which also means \"straight.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"Some editions write *huo* 惑 instead of *huo* 或.\"\nQian’s commentary: The Suizhou edition and the Palace Library edition agree with this stone inscription. Moreover, the *Outer Chapters of the Shenzi* cites seven sentences from \"Laozi says,\" omitting only the two characters *shi yi* 是以, matching Fu Yi’s version. Here, *de* 得 refers to the \"attainment of the One\" as spoken of in Chapter 39. *Huo* 或 should be read as *huo* 惑, meaning \"sometimes this, sometimes that,\" contrasting with the meaning of \"attaining the One.\"\n\nNot displaying oneself, thus one is illuminated;\nNot asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished;\nNot boasting, thus one achieves merit;\nNot priding oneself, thus one endures.\n\nQian’s commentary: In the stele edition, the character *zhang* 彰 is damaged and unclear, and the following *bu* 不 is effaced; these should be supplemented according to other editions. Furthermore, in the Suizhou and Palace Library editions, the phrase \"Not displaying oneself, thus one is illuminated\" appears after \"Not asserting oneself, thus one is distinguished\"; in Tang Li Yue’s edition, \"Not boasting, thus one achieves merit\" appears after \"Not priding oneself, thus one endures.\" Additionally, the *Zhuangzi* (\"Shanmu\") states: \"I have heard the Perfect Person say, 'Those who boast achieve no merit; those who complete merit fall; those who complete fame are diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the multitude?'\" This echoes Chapter 9 of the *Laozi*—\"Having achieved merit, withdraw the self; this is the Dao of heaven\"—and the present chapter’s teaching, \"Not boasting, thus one achieves merit.\"\n\nOnly by not contending does nothing under heaven contend with him.\n\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang edition omits the character *neng* 能.\nQian’s commentary: The *Huainanzi* (\"Yuandao\") states, \"Because he does not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with him,\" which is drawn from this chapter. Wang Niansun says: \"'None dare' originally read 'none can'; later scholars altered it following the *Wenzi* (\"Daoyuan\"). Only by not contending with the myriad things can none contend with him—this is what is meant by 'the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.' If it read 'none dare,' it would miss the point. Below, it says, 'Great merit, firm and unyielding, none can contend with it.' The *Laozi* states, 'Only by not contending does nothing under heaven contend with him,' and again, 'Because he does not contend, nothing under heaven can contend with him.' All these serve as evidence.\" Wei Zheng’s *Qunshu Zhiyao* cites this sentence as \"none can contend with him.\"\n\nWhat the ancients called \"the crooked is preserved whole\"—was this an empty saying?\nThus it is preserved whole and returned.\n\nYan Kejun notes: \"Was this an empty saying\" in other editions reads \"Was this an empty saying indeed?\" \"Thus preserved whole\" in other editions reads \"truly preserved whole,\" without the character *gu* 故.\nWei Jiasun notes: The Imperial Commentary includes a *zhe* 者 after *quan* 全, and the following sentence reads \"Was this empty speech indeed?\" Yan cites the *zai* 哉 but overlooks the *zhe* 者 and *yan* 言.\nQian’s commentary: The Suizhou edition matches this stone inscription. *Cheng* 成 should be *cheng* 誠. Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* (2) cites the *Ancient Laozi*, where *cheng* 成 appears as ○, and *cheng* 誠 appears as ○. In the received text, *cheng* 成 appears seventeen times, while *cheng* 誠 appears only here. Moreover, \"the crooked is preserved whole\" is an ancient saying; the *Sunzi* (\"Jiudi\") states, \"Those skilled in the Dao preserve themselves through crookedness,\" which clearly attests to this. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Tianxia\") discusses the *Laozi*, saying, \"While others seek fortune, he alone preserves himself through crookedness, saying, 'May I merely avoid blame?'\" This is drawn from the present chapter.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiang’s reading:\n*Ying* 盈 and *xin* 新 rhyme (Zhen and Geng in harmonious rhyme; these two lines originally appeared below \"the crooked becomes straight,\" but have been moved here according to rhyme).\n*Zhi* 直, *de* 得, *huo* 惑, and *shi* 式 rhyme (Zhi group; *huo* 惑 read as *hu bi*).\n*Ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, *gong* 功, and *zhang* 长 rhyme (Yang and Dong in harmonious rhyme; *gong* 功 rhymes as *guang*).\n*Zheng* 争 and *zheng* 争 rhyme (Geng group).\n\nQian’s commentary: *Ying* 盈 belongs to the Geng group, *xin* 新 to the Zhen group—these are Zhen and Geng in harmonious rhyme. *Ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, and *zhang* 长 belong to the Yang group; *gong* 功 to the Dong group—these are Yang and Dong in harmonious rhyme. The character *zhi* 直 in the Jing, Suizhou, and Palace Library editions is written as *zheng* 正, which belongs to the Geng group. Xi Diao takes *quan* 全, *zheng* 正, *ying* 盈, and *xin* 新 as rhyming, saying: \"Rhyme *quan* 全 and *xin* 新 with *zheng* 正 and *ying* 盈—this is a case of sound variation, like the rhyming of *qing* 清, *ren* 人, *xin* 新, *nian* 年, *sheng* 生, *lian* 怜, *sheng* 声, *ming* 鸣, *zheng* 征, and *cheng* 成 in the *Jiu Bian*.\" Gao Benhan agrees with Xi, though he treats *zheng* 正 and *ying* 盈 as internal rhyme. He also takes *de* 得 and *huo* 惑 as rhyming, *yi* 一 and *shi* 式 as rhyming, and *ming* 明, *zhang* 彰, *gong* 功, *zhang* 长, *zheng* 争, and *zheng* 争 as a single rhyme. The various theories are divergent; only Jiang’s rearrangement of the text to fit the rhyme seems unsatisfactory. This chapter actually employs two alternating rhymes: *quan* 全, *ying* 盈, and *xin* 新 form one rhyme; *zhi* 直, *de* 得, *huo* 惑, and *shi* 式 form another. Chen Zhu takes *zai* 哉 and *zhi* 之 as rhyming. *Zai* 哉 and *zhi* 之 both belong to the Zhi group. Yao Nai treats \"What the ancients called 'the crooked is preserved whole'—was this an empty saying? Truly preserved whole and returned\" as a single section with the following chapter, \"Sparse speech is natural,\" arguing: \"*Yan* 言, *quan* 全, and *ran* 然 rhyme. 'Still as if valuing speech, merit achieved and affairs completed, the hundred clans all say, \"We are naturally thus\"—this explains the present passage.'\"\n\nThe Jinglong stele edition contains seventy-seven characters; the Palace Library edition, seventy-four; the Heshang, Wang, Fu, and Fan editions, seventy-eight.",

The *Zuozhuan* *Zhaogong* 28th year *Zhengyi* commentary cites: 'Even Heaven and Earth cannot endure forever—how much less man *hu* 乎,' and the *Mouzi Lihuo Lun* also cites: 'Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long—how much less man *hu* 乎,' both including *hu* 乎.\n\nThus, those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way;\nthose who align with virtue/power are embraced by virtue/power;\nthose who align with loss are met with loss.\n\nYan Kejun states: The ancient characters *de* 得 and *de* 德 were interchangeable; *dezhi* 德之 thus means *dezhi* 得之.\nThe Heshang edition reads: 'Thus, those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way; those devoted to virtue/power align with virtue/power; those devoted to loss align with loss.

The original text reads: 'Those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way,' and the following *dezhe* 德者 and *shizhe* 失者 elliptically follow the preceding *congshi* 从事, as if to say: 'Those who devote themselves to the Way align with the Way; those who devote themselves to virtue/power align with virtue/power; those who devote themselves to loss align with loss.'

The Suizhou and Palace Library editions both read *dao dezhi* 道得之 and *de dezhi* 德得之; the Fu and Fan editions also read *de* 得, as this *de* 得 pairs with the following *shi* 失 to form parallel structure.\n\nThe trust that is insufficient gives rise to distrust.\n\nYan Kejun states: The Heshang and Wang Bi editions read: 'Trust is insufficient *yan* 焉, and so there is distrust *yan* 焉.'\nLuo Zhenyu states: The Jinglong and British Library editions omit both *yan* 焉; the Jingfu edition omits the second *yan* 焉.\nQian Zhi notes: The Suizhou, Palace Library, and Wang Xizhi editions also omit both *yan* 焉; the Fu and Muromachi editions omit the second *yan* 焉.

      "translated_text": "Yan Kejun states: The *Yuzhu* and Heshang editions read \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not endure,\" while Wang Bi’s edition has \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 企) do not endure.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Shiwen* glosses, \"The Heshang edition has *chi* 豉.\" It appears that *chi* is likely a corruption of *qi* 跂. The *Yuzhu* and *Guangming* editions also read *qi* 跂. The *Guangming* edition includes the line \"Those who pant do not endure\" above this. Wu Yun, in *Erbai Lantingzhai Jinshi Ji*, collating the *Guangming* edition, states: \"All other editions lack the four characters 'Those who pant do not endure.'\" Wei Jiasun remarks: Few characters remain on this stele, but among them, the line \"Those who pant do not endure\" (Yan Qian’s note: \"文\" is a misprint for \"久\") is absent from all transmitted block-printed editions and other stone inscriptions. Yan Qian notes: The Palace Library and Suizhou editions both correctly read \"Those who pant do not endure.\" The *Shuowen* defines *chuan* 喘 as \"rapid breathing.\" Moreover, *qi* 企 and *qi* 跂 were used interchangeably in antiquity. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Autumn Floods\" chapter reads, \"to pick up without standing on tiptoe (*qi* 跂),\" and the *Shiwen* notes, \"*Qi* 跂 is written as *qi* 企 in one version.\" In the \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, \"men see him standing on tiptoe (*qi* 跂),\" the ancient manuscript scroll reads *qi* 企. The *Wen Xuan*’s *Jiang Fu* commentary by Li Shan also states, \"企 and 跂 are the same.\" Thus, the Heshang edition’s *qi* 跂 is equivalent to *qi* 企. The *Hanshu*’s \"Annals of Emperor Gaozu,\" in Yan Shigu’s commentary, defines *qi* 企 as \"to lift the heels and stretch the body.\" The *Yupian* states: \"*Qi* 跂, pronounced *chi* 豉. There is a country of those who walk on tiptoes, whose people walk without their heels touching the ground.\" The *Zilin* defines *qi* 企 as \"to lift the heels.\" The meanings of the two characters are also identical.\n\n○者不行.\nYan Kejun states: \"○者\" appears as \"○者\" in all editions. I believe it should be \"○者.\" Wei Jiasun remarks: In the original engraving, \"○\" is offset to the right, suggesting the left half of \"○\" was omitted. Yan’s emendation to \"○\" as \"○\" is incorrect. Yan Qian notes: \"○\" is equivalent to *kua* 跨. The *Yupian*’s section on \"○\" provides two pronunciations: *kou hua* and *kou wa*, both meaning \"to take a stride,\" identical to *kua* 跨. The *Shuowen* defines *kua* 跨 as \"to step over,\" and Duan Yucai comments: \"To widen the space between the legs in order to cross something.\" The Muromachi edition reads the first two lines as \"Those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not endure; those who stand on tiptoe (*qi* 跂) do not walk,\" but the repetition of *qi* 跂 is erroneous.\n\nThose who rely on their own vision are not enlightened; those who assert their own correctness are not illustrious; those who boast achieve no merit; those who are self-conceited do not endure. Yan Kejun states: The Heshang and Wang Bi editions include the particle *zhe* 者 after \"rely on their own vision,\" and the same applies to the following four lines. Wei Jiasun remarks: The *Yuzhu* edition includes *zhe* 者 after \"vision,\" but omits it in the next three lines. Yan Qian notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the \"Indictment of Wang Yuan\" omits both instances of *zhe* 者. Additionally, the Palace Library and Suizhou editions read \"boast\" (*zi rao* 自饶) instead of \"self-assertion\" (*zi fa* 自伐).\n\nIn the Way, these are called surplus food and superfluous conduct. Yan Kejun states: \"In the Way\" (*qi zai Dao* 其在道) appears as \"in the Way, too\" (*qi zai Dao ye* 其在道也) in Wang Bi’s edition, and as \"in relation to the Way\" (*qi yu Dao* 其于道也) in the *Yuzhu* and Heshang editions. Yan Qian notes: The character *zhui* 赘 in the Palace Library and Suizhou editions appears as *chuo* 啜, which is incorrect. The *Fangyan* defines *chuo* 啜 as \"to offer food,\" and the *Zilin* defines it as \"to pour wine as an offering, to sacrifice.\" The phrase *chuo xing* 啜行 is meaningless, likely a phonetic corruption. Wang Dao states: \"Conduct\" (*xing* 行) should be \"form\" (*xing* 形). \"Superfluous form\" refers to forms that are appendages, such as webbed toes. Yi Shunding remarks: \"Conduct\" (*xing* 行) may be interchangeable with \"form\" (*xing* 形). \"Superfluous form\" aligns with Wang Bi’s commentary on \"superfluity.\" Superfluity can refer to form but not to conduct. The *Liezi*’s \"Tang’s Questions\" chapter reads, \"Taihang and Wangwu, the two mountains,\" and Zhang Zhan’s commentary notes, \"行 should be 形.\" This confirms that *xing* 行 and *xing* 形 were used interchangeably in ancient texts. Zhuang Xichang states: According to Li Yue’s *Daode Zhenjing Xinzhu* from the Tang dynasty: \"Like leftover food, like excess flesh on the body.\" Lin Xi’s *Daode Zhenjing Kouyi* from the Song dynasty states: \"Leftover food is discarded; superfluous growths on the body are detested.\" Chen Jingyuan’s *Daode Zhenjing Cangshi Zuanwei* from the Song dynasty states: \"Like discarded leftovers, which people detest; like attached growths, which people find ugly.\" All three texts interpret *xing* 行 as *xing* 形. Yan Qian notes: Reading *xing* 行 as *xing* 形 is correct. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Webbed Toes\" chapter states: \"Attached growths and hanging wens emerge from the body and exceed one’s nature.\" The *Guangya* defines *zhui* 赘 as \"a wen.\" The *Shiming* explains it as \"a piece of flesh growing horizontally, attached to the body,\" or \"a tumor.\" The character *xuan* 县 in \"attached growths and hanging wens\" is written as *xuan* 悬 in the *Yiqiejing Yinyi* and the *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Chen Kongzhang’s \"Proclamation to Yuzhou on Behalf of Yuan Shao.\" Since attached growths and hanging wens emerge from the body, they are called \"superfluous forms.\" *Zhui xing* 赘行 should be read as *zhui xing* 赘形, as the characters were interchangeable in ancient texts. Gao Heng states: I suspect \"conduct\" (*xing* 行) should be \"clothing\" (*yi* 衣). In ancient script, *yi* 衣 was written as ○, and *xing* 行 as ○, leading to confusion due to their similarity. The *Fayan*’s \"Inquiring into the Way\" chapter states, \"Whether using or not using intelligence, whether benefiting or not benefiting, there is no superfluity or deficiency,\" and Sima Guang’s commentary notes: \"Excess is called superfluity; insufficiency is called deficiency.\" Thus, superfluity is also surplus. \"Surplus food and superfluous clothing\" is akin to \"surplus food and surplus clothing.\" When food is in surplus, the hungry detest it; when clothing is in surplus, the cold detest it. Hence, it is said, \"Some beings may detest them,\" which aligns with the modern proverb, \"One family’s warmth and fullness invite a thousand families’ resentment.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nZhu Qian’s note: Gao’s argument is highly discerning, yet emending the text to explain the *Classic* makes it difficult to inspire confidence. Moreover, the phrase \"superfluous clothing\" (*zhuì yī* 赘衣) does not simply mean \"surplus clothing\" (*yú yī* 余衣). The *Guangyun*, under the *ji* 霁 rhyme for *zhuì* 赘, states: \"*Zhuì yī* is an official title.\" It is thus abundantly clear that it cannot form a parallel with \"surplus food\" (*yú shí* 余食). \"Some beings may detest them,\" and therefore the man of the Way does not dwell in such a state.\n\nYan Kejun says: In the phrase \"some beings may detest them\" (*wù huò è zhī* 物或恶之), all versions lack the character *you* 有 (\"may\"). In the phrase \"therefore the man of the Way does not dwell\" (*gù yǒu dào bù chǔ* 故有道不处), the *Yu zhu* 御注 and Wang Bi’s editions include the particle *zhe* 者 after *Dao* 道, while the *Heshang Gong* 河上公 edition includes *zhe* 者 and ends the sentence with *ye* 也. Zhu Qian’s note: In the phrase \"some (*huò* 或) may detest them,\" all versions lack the character *you* 有. The *Guan* 馆 edition and *Suizhou* 遂州 edition omit the character *huò* 或 after *you* 有. The *Guangya*, in its first chapter on glosses, states: \"*Huò* 或 means *you* 有.\" This shows that *huò* 或 and *you* 有 were interchangeable in antiquity, and one of them must be superfluous. I suspect that this *you* 有 is a phonetic shift from *chǒu* 丑 (\"repulsive\"). Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun*, in its fifth fascicle, cites an ancient *Laozi* that includes the character *chǒu* 丑, written as ○. Further note: Sima Guang’s commentary states: \"These are all cases of external striving and internal depletion. Just as discarded surplus food provokes disgust, so an attached superfluous form provokes revulsion.\" Here, *chǒu* 丑 (\"repulsive\") and *è* 恶 (\"detest\") form a parallel. I suspect that the version Sima Guang saw originally read: \"some beings find them repulsive and detest them\" (*wù huò chǒu è zhī* 物或丑恶之).\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Sheng’s *Yun Du* 韵读 groups the rhymes as follows: *xíng* 行, *míng* 明, *zhāng* 彰, *gōng* 功, *cháng* 长, and *xíng* 行 (the *yang* 阳 and *dong* 东 rhymes intermingle, with *gōng* 功 rhyming as *guāng* 光); *è* 恶 and *chǔ* 处 rhyme (both in the *yu* 鱼 rhyme group, with *chǔ* 处 in the departing tone). Yao Wentian agrees, though Deng Tingzhen does not include *gōng* 功. Note: *xíng* 行, *míng* 明, *zhāng* 彰, and *cháng* 长 belong to the *yang* 阳 rhyme group, while *gōng* 功 belongs to the *dong* 东 group—this is an instance of *yang* and *dong* rhymes intermingling.\n\nThe *Jinglong* 景龙 stele edition contains forty-two characters. The *Guan* 馆 edition’s note mistakenly records \"thirty-one characters\" (卅 is an error for ○). The *Heshang Gong* 河上公, *Fu* 傅, and Wang [Bi] editions contain forty-eight characters; the Wang [Bi] and Fan [Yingyuan] editions contain forty-seven. The *Heshang Gong* edition titles this chapter \"Bitter Kindness\" (*Kǔ ēn* 苦恩, twenty-fourth), while the Wang edition titles it \"Chapter Twenty-Four\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Chapter on One Who Stands on Tiptoe Does Not Endure\" (*Qǐ zhě bù lì zhāng dì èrshísì* 跂者不立章第二十四).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\nThere is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and void!\nIt stands alone and does not change,\ncircling everywhere without peril,\nand may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth.\nI do not know its name;\nI style it the *Dao*.\nForced to name it, I call it *great*.\n\n---\n\nZhu Qian’s note: In the stele edition, the phrase \"I force a name upon it, calling it\" (*wú qiǎng wéi zhī míng yuē* 吾强为之名曰) is followed by a character that is indistinct due to erosion; it should be supplemented as *dà* 大 (\"great\") based on other editions. Furthermore, all editions lack the second *wú* 吾 (\"I\") in this sentence, which is likely superfluous. The Fan edition includes the characters *gù qiǎng* 故强 (\"therefore forced\") before *zì* 字 (\"style\"), while the Fu edition writes *qiǎng* 强 as *qiáng* 強. Fan Yingyuan says: \"Wang Bi’s edition matches the ancient version. The *Heshang Gong* edition lacks the character ○, and I follow the ancient version.\" Liu Shipei says: According to the *Han Feizi*’s *Jie Lao* 解老 chapter, \"The sage observes its profound emptiness, employs its all-pervading circulation, and forcibly styles it the *Dao*,\" the character *qiǎng* 强 (\"forced\") should precede *zì* 字 (\"style\"), aligning with the phrase below, \"forced to name it, I call it *great*\" (*qiǎng wéi zhī míng yuē dà* 强为之名曰大).

      "translated_text": "Yu Shunding says: According to the *Zhouyi Jijie* (Collected Explications of the *Book of Changes*), volume seventeen, Gan Bao quotes: \"Laozi says, *'I do not know its name; forcibly styling it, I call it the Dao.'*\" The character *qiǎng* 强 (\"forced\") precedes *zì* 字 (\"style\"), matching the version cited in the *Mouzi*. Zhuang Xichang says: Fan [Yingyuan] states that \"Wang Bi’s edition matches the ancient version,\" which implies that Wang’s text also includes *qiǎng* 强 before *zì* 字. In the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Zeyang\" chapter, Guo Xiang’s commentary reads, \"and forcibly styles it the Dao,\" indicating that Guo’s edition likewise includes *qiǎng* 强. Reasoning from principle, if *great* is a forced name, then *Dao* must also be a forced style—thus, the version with *qiǎng* 强 before *zì* 字 is correct.\n\n□□ passes away; passing away is called *far*; far is called *return*.\nQian Zhi notes: The stele edition includes the characters *dà yuē* 大曰 (\"great is called\") before *shì* 逝 (\"passes away\"), though the inscription is blurred and unclear; these should be restored according to other editions. Yan Kejun says: For *\"far is called return,\"* the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions write *fǎn* 反 (\"return\"). Wu Yun says: The Fu and Yizhou editions both write *fǎn* 返 (\"return\") instead of *fǎn* 反. Qian Zhi notes: The Panxi, Louzheng, Gu Huan, and Zhao Mengfu editions also write *fǎn* 返, matching this stele. *Return* means that all things, in their multiplicity, each revert to their root. To describe the body of the Dao: *great* does not suffice to encompass it, so it is named *passing away*. The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* section states: *\"Passing away* 逝 means *to proceed* 行.\" The *Analects* says, *\"The passing away is like this!\"* and Huang Kan’s commentary explains: \"An expression of departure.\" Yet *passing away* still does not suffice, so it is further named *far*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Far* 远 means *distant* 辽.\" The *Erya*’s *Shigu* section says: *\"Far* 远 means *remote* 遐.\" The *Guoyu* commentary explains: \"Referring to what lies beyond the reach of ear and eye.\" However, where there is departure, there must be return, so it is also called *return*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Return* 返 means *to come back* 还.\" The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* section says: *\"Return* 返 means *to revert* 归.\" In returning, the Dao circulates without cease.\n\nThe Dao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; the king is great.\nYan Kejun says: In all editions, the character *gù* 故 (\"thus\") precedes *\"the Dao is great.\"* For *\"the king is great,\"* all editions include *yì* 亦 (\"also\") after *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). Qian Zhi notes: The Fu edition omits *gù* 故, the Suzhou edition omits *yì* 亦, and the Palace Library edition omits both *gù* 故 and *yì* 亦. Additionally, the Fu and Fan editions write *rén* 人 (\"human\") instead of *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). Fan Yingyuan says: The character *rén* 人 (\"human\") in Fu Yi’s edition matches the ancient version, while the *Heshang Gong* edition writes *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). From the perspective of *Heshang Gong*, the king is the most exalted among humans, reflecting a reverence for the sovereign. However, considering the later phrase *\"humans emulate Earth,\"* the ancient version’s meaning is coherent. Moreover, humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, standing alongside Heaven and Earth as one of the Three Powers. When entrusted with this Dao, humans are indeed also great. Chen Zhu says: The *Shuowen*’s *Da* 大 section states: *\"Heaven is great, Earth is great, humans are also great\"*—depicting the human form. This is the version Xu Shen encountered. Duan Yucai’s commentary notes: *\"The Laozi says, 'The Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, humans are also great.' ... 'Humans emulate Earth, Earth emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao.'\" Thus, Duan’s edition likely also read *\"humans are also great.\"* Otherwise, he would have specified that modern editions read *\"the king is also great.\"* The correction is now established. Humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, the most evolved product of Heaven’s process—hence, *\"humans are also great.\"*\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things, and the king occupies one of them.\nYan Kejun says: For *\"and the king occupies one,\"* the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi editions write *\"and the king resides among them.\"* Qian Zhi notes: The Fan edition writes *rén* 人 (\"human\") instead of *wáng* 王 (\"king\"). The Fu edition reads *\"and the king occupies one of them in honor,\"* where *zūn* 尊 (\"honor\") is likely a miswriting of *yān* 焉 (\"among\") due to graphical similarity. The *Guang Hongming Ji*, in Falin’s response to Fu Yi’s critique of Buddhism, quotes the following line as *\"and the Dao occupies one of them.\"* Additionally, the character *chǔ* 处 (\"occupies\") in the Palace Library and Fu editions is written as *chǔ* 处, while the Fan edition writes *jū* 居 (\"resides\"); *chǔ* 处 is correct. Jiang Xichang says: \"According to Wang Bi’s commentary, *'occupying the greatness of the ruler,'* Wang’s edition writes *jū* 居 as *chǔ* 处. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* also quotes it as *chǔ* 处.\"\n\nHumans emulate Earth; Earth emulates Heaven; Heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity.\nQian Zhi notes: For *\"humans emulate Earth,\"* the Fu edition retains *rén* 人 (\"humans\"), while Kou Caizhi’s edition writes *wáng* 王 (\"king\")—a later interpolation by those who revered the sovereign, altering the original text. This practice has a long history. However, Gu Huan’s *Chengshu* commentary states, *\"Humans* 人 refers to the king,\" which, though convoluted, still serves as evidence that the *Laozi* originally read *rén* 人, not *wáng* 王.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads rhymes as follows: *chéng* 成 and *shēng* 生 rhyme (Geng 耕 department); *gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, *mǔ* 母, and *dào* 道 rhyme (Zhi 之 and You 幽 interdepartmental rhyme, with *gǎi* 改 read as *yǐ* 已 and *dào* 道 rhyming as *tú yǐ fǎn* 徒以反). *Dà* 大 and *shì* 逝 rhyme (Zhi 祭 department, with *dà* 大 read as *tú liè fǎn* 徒列反 and *shì* 逝 as *shí liè fǎn* 时列反). *Yuǎn* 远 and *fǎn* 反 rhyme (Yuan 元 department). Yao Wentian and Deng Tingzhen did not address the character *dào* 道. Qian Zhi notes: *Gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, and *mǔ* 母 belong to the Zhi 之 department; *dào* 道 belongs to the You 幽 department—these form an interdepartmental rhyme. Xi Di: *Gǎi* 改, *dài* 殆, and *mǔ* 母 rhyme; *shì* 逝, *yuǎn* 远, and *fǎn* 反 rhyme. He adds: *\"Shì* 逝 is read as *xiān* 鲜. For example, in the *Book of Songs*’ *Sang Rou*, *'shì bù yǐ zhuó'* 逝不以濯 is cited in the *Mozi*’s *Shang Xian* as *'xiān bù yǐ zhuó'* 鲜不以濯. In the *Book of Songs*’ *Xin Tai*, *xiān* 鲜 rhymes with *cǐ* 泚 and *mí* 弥; in *Gu Feng*, *sōu* 搜 and *wēi* 萎 rhyme with *yuàn* 怨—all serving as examples.\"*",

Additionally, *tiān* 天 and *rán* 然 rhyme.\nQian Zhi notes: *Yuǎn* 远 and *fǎn* 反 rhyme. The *Analects*’ *Zi Han* chapter cites lost *Shi* 诗 verses; the *Chu Ci*’s *Li Sao*, *Guo Shang*, and *Ai Ying* all provide collateral evidence. Furthermore, the *dà* 大 in *\"qiǎng míng zhī yuē dà\"* 强名之曰大 rhymes distantly with the five *dà* 大 below.\nChen Di states: *\"Gǎi\"* 改 is pronounced *jǐ* 己, as *Shuowen* lists *jǐ* 己 as its phonetic. In the *Laozi*: *\"Dúlì ér bù gǎi, zhōu xíng ér bù dài\"* 独立而不改，周行而不殆; the *Zhuangzi* cites an ancient poem: *\"Měi chéng zài jiǔ, è chéng bù jí gǎi\"* 美成在久，恶成不及改.\nThe *Jinglong* stele version contains seventy-nine characters; the *Guan* edition’s chapter-end note matches this count. The *Heshang Gong* version has eighty-six characters, Wang Bi’s eighty-five, Fu Yi’s eighty-seven, and Fan Yingyuan’s eighty-eight. The *Heshang Gong* titles it *\"Xiàng Xuán Zhāng Dì Èrshíwǔ\"* 象玄章第二十五, Wang Bi’s *\"Èrshíwǔ Zhāng\"* 二十五章, and Fan Yingyuan’s *\"Yǒu Wù Hùn Chéng Zhāng Dì Èrshíwǔ\"* 有物混成章第二十五. The *Jinglong* stele mistakenly merges the following chapter’s *\"Jìng wèi zào jūn\"* 静为躁君 into this one.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n*Virtue is the root of the light; stillness is the lord of the restless.*\nQian Zhi notes: Huang Kan’s *Lunyu Xue’er Yishu* cites it as *\"Zhòng wèi qīng gēn, jìng wèi zào běn\"* 重为轻根，静为躁本—*\"gēn\"* 根 and *\"běn\"* 本 form a parallel, and the meaning is superior.\n*Thus the noble person travels all day without leaving the baggage train.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Shì yǐ jūnzǐ\"* 是以君子 appears as *\"shì yǐ shèngrén\"* 是以圣人 in the *Heshang Gong* and Wang Bi versions.\nQian Zhi notes: Han Fei’s *Jie Lao* uses *\"jūnzǐ\"* 君子; the *Panxi*, *Lou Zheng*, *Gao Diao*, Fu, Fan, and Wang Xizhi editions all concur. Karlgren’s edition omits the four characters *\"shì yǐ jūnzǐ\"* 是以君子. The *Suizhou* edition reads *\"xíng zhōng rì\"* 行终日 instead of *\"zhōng rì xíng\"* 终日行. The *Yuzhu* and *Jingfu* editions write *\"zī\"* 辎 as ○, with Luo Yun noting: \"This is an alternate form of *zī* 辎.\" Hong Yixuan states: The *Heshang Gong* commentary reads: *\"Zī, jìng yě. Shèngrén zhōng rì xíng Dào, bù lí qí jìng yǔ zhòng yě.\"* 辎，静也。圣人终日行道，不离其静与重也. Yixuan notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s *Dongjing Fu* cites Xue Zong’s annotation: *\"Zīzhòng, chē yě.\"* 辎重，车也, and Li Shan’s annotation: *\"Zhāng Jí yuē: ‘Zīzhòng, yǒu yī zhī chē yě.’\"* 张楫曰：「辎重，有衣之车也。」 This suggests the noble person remains as though within a covered carriage to nurture stillness—it does not mean *zī* 辎 itself signifies stillness. The commentary’s interpretation is flawed.\nXu Zi states: According to ancient glosses, *\"zī\"* 辎 was never defined as *\"jìng\"* 静... The *Wen Xuan* annotations are superior to the gloss *\"zī, jìng yě\"* 辎，静也.\nThe terms *\"zīzhòng\"* 辎重, *\"róng guān\"* 荣观, *\"yàn chǔ\"* 燕处, and *\"wàn shèng zhī zhǔ\"* 万乘之主 are all parallel in structure.\nQian Zhi notes: Hong and Xu’s arguments are sound. Fang Risheng’s *Yunhui Xiaobu* cites: The *Shuowen* defines *\"zī\"* 辎 as *\"píng chē, qián yī chē, hòu cóng chē, zī shēng\"* 軿车，前衣车，后从车，甾声, with Xu Shen adding: *\"Suǒwèi kù chē\"* 所谓库车. The *Zilin* states: *\"Zài yīwù chē, qián hòu jiē bì\"* 载衣物车，前后皆蔽. The *Zuozhuan*’s *Xuan 12* *Zhengyi* cites the *Shuowen*: *\"Zī, yī míng píng, qián hòu bì yě\"* 辎，一名軿，前后蔽也. The *Hou Hanshu*’s *Yu Fu Zhi* annotation reads: *\"Píng chē yǒu yī bì wú hòu yuán zhě, wèi zhī zī\"* 軿车有衣蔽无后辕者，谓之辎. The *Shiming* states: *\"Zī, píng yě. Yǒu dǐ yuē zī, wú dǐ yuē píng\"* 辎，屏也。有邸曰辎，无邸曰軿. The *Guangwu Ji* annotation cites the *Shiming*: *\"Zī, yě. Wèi jūn liáng shíwù zá zài zhī, yǐ qí léi zhòng, gù chēng zīzhòng\"* 辎，也。谓军粮什物杂载之，以其累重，故称辎重. The *Qian Han Shu*’s *Han Anguo Zhuan* reads *\"jī zīzhòng\"* 击辎重, with Yan Shigu noting: *\"Zī wèi yī chē, zhòng wèi zài zhòngwù chē, gù xíngzhě zhī zī, zǒng yuē zīzhòng\"* 辎谓衣车，重谓载重物车，故行者之资，总曰辎重. (Volume 2)\nFang’s research is thorough: *Zīzhòng* 辎重 refers to a covered wagon carrying supplies, enclosed front and rear, laden with weight—hence the term. In antiquity, ceremonial processions used passenger carriages, while military marches employed war chariots, both followed by *zīzhòng* 辎重 wagons. This metaphor illustrates that the noble person’s daily conduct must always be rooted in weightiness, never acting recklessly.\n*Though there be splendid vistas, they dwell in tranquil detachment.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Yàn chǔ\"* 燕处 appears as *\"yàn chǔ\"* 宴处 in the Wang Bi and Fu Yi versions.\nQian Zhi notes: The current Wang Bi edition writes *\"yàn\"* 燕; the *Yuzhu*, *Jingfu*, and *Guan* editions also use *\"yàn\"* 燕. The *Shiwen* lists *\"yàn\"* 宴: *\"Yú jiàn fǎn, Jiǎnwén yún: ‘Wèi jìng sī zhī suǒ yàn jū yě.’\"* 于见反，简文云：「谓静思之所宴居也。」 The *Wen Xuan*’s *You Tiantai Shan Fu* annotation concurs.\n*How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat the world lightly with his own person?*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Rúhé\"* 如何 appears as *\"nàihé\"* 奈何 in other editions; *\"yǐ shēn\"* 以身 includes an *\"ér\"* 而 above *\"yǐ\"* 以 in other versions.\nJiao Hong states: *\"Nàihé\"* 奈何 appears as *\"rú zhī hé\"* 如之何 in ancient editions.\nQian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan ancient editions both read *\"rú zhī hé\"* 如之何, though the *\"zhī\"* 之 may be superfluous. *\"Nàihé\"* 奈何 is likely a gloss, as the *Qiang Ben Chengshu*’s commentary reads *\"rúhé nàihé yě\"* 如何奈何也—this serves as evidence.\n*Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the lord.*\nYan Kejun states: *\"Qīng zé shī chén\"* 轻则失臣 appears as *\"shī běn\"* 失本 in Wang Bi and *\"shī gēn\"* 失根 in the *Dayian*.\nQian Zhi notes: The correct text should read *\"qīng zé shī gēn, zào zé shī jūn\"* 轻则失根，躁则失君, forming a parallel with the opening line *\"zhòng wèi qīng gēn, jìng wèi zào jūn\"* 重为轻根，静为躁君.",

Here, it extends to mean the horizontal bar for closing doors. ○ is a Chu dialect term in the *Laozi*, a loan for *\"jiàn\"* 楗.\nThe *Fangyan*, volume 5: \"Door keys, east of the Pass, in the regions of Chen and Chu, are called *jiàn* 键, and the character is also written as ○.\" Now, ○ is the ancient form.

The *Shuowen* states: *\"Shéng\"* 绳 is rope; *\"yuē\"* 约 is binding. The *Zhuangzi*, *Webbed Toes*, says: \"Relying on cords, knots, glue, and lacquer for firmness is an encroachment on virtue.\" *\"Yuē\"* 约 also means rope; *\"shéngyuē\"* 绳约 is akin to modern \"cord and rope.\" The *Zuozhuan*, Duke Ai 11, records Gongsun Hui saying: \"People use *xún* 寻 of rope, but Wu people have short hair,\" with Du Yu’s note: *\"Yuē\"* 约 is rope. The *Yili*, *Jì Xī Jì*, states: *\"Yuē suí yuē pèi\"* 约绥约辔, with Zheng Xuan’s note: *\"Yuē\"* 约 is rope. Old commentaries take *\"yuē\"* 约 as the *\"yuē\"* 约 of restraint, which does not align with the ancient meaning of the *Laozi*.\n\nThus, the sage is ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none;\nEver skilled at saving things, and so discards nothing.\nThis is called inheriting enlightenment.\nYan Kejun notes: \"And so discards none\" — all editions write *\"gù\"* 故 for *\"ér\"* 而, and the following clause is the same.\nSun Kuang’s *Gǔjīn Běn Kǎozhèng* states: The four lines \"Ever skilled at saving people\" are absent in one edition. *\"Gù\"* 故 is written as *\"ér\"* 而 in one version.\nChao Yuezhi says: \"Ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none; ever skilled at saving things, and so discards nothing\" — only the Heshang Gong edition preserves this, while ancient editions lack it. We rely on Fu Yi’s clarification.\nTōjō Ittō notes: According to Fu Yi, the twenty characters from \"Thus\" to \"discards nothing\" are unique to the Heshang Gong edition, absent in ancient editions. Chao Yuezhi’s postscript cites this to refute Wang’s view. Initially, I took this as credible, but upon checking the *Huainanzi*, *Dao and Its Power*, which quotes the *Laozi*: \"People discard no people; things discard no things — this is called inheriting enlightenment.\" From this, even Fu Yi’s ancient edition cannot be taken as definitive.\n\nThe good are the teachers of the not-good;\nThe not-good are the resources of the good.\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Gù shànrén\"* 故善人 — the *Imperial Commentary* and *Yongle Dadian* write *\"gù shànrén\"* 故善人, while Heshang Gong writes *\"gù shànrén zhě\"* 故善人者. *\"Bùshànrén\"* 不善人 — Heshang Gong adds *\"zhě\"* 者 after *\"shànrén\"* 善人.\nJiang Xichang notes: The *Huainanzi*, *Dao and Its Power*, quotes the latter clause as: \"The not-good are the resources of the good,\" with no *\"zhě\"* 者 but two *\"yě\"* 也. Wang Bi’s commentary: \"Thus, the not-good are what the good take as resources,\" suggesting Wang’s edition matches the *Huainanzi*.\nThose who do not value their teachers,\nNor cherish their resources —\nQian Zhi notes: The *Qúnshū Zhìyào* in the Japanese Tenmei edition writes *\"guì qí shī\"* 贵其师, with a marginal note: \"The old edition lacked the three characters *'guì qí shī'* 贵其师; they have been added.\" Without the *\"bù\"* 不, the text reads: \"Value their teachers, do not value their resources,\" which better suits the meaning. This aligns with the earlier line \"The not-good are the resources of the good\" and the theme of \"Ever skilled at saving people, and so discards none.\" Heshang Gong’s commentary on *\"bù guì qí shī\"* 不贵其师: \"Alone, without aid,\" and on *\"bù ài qí zī\"* 不爱其资: \"Without use.\" Lacking aid and use seems to favor the reading: \"Value their teachers, do not value their resources,\" which better fits the meaning.\nThough wise, are greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential subtlety.\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Suī zhī\"* 虽知 — Heshang Gong and Wang Bi write *\"suī zhì\"* 虽智. *\"Cǐ wèi\"* 此谓 — all editions write *\"shì wèi\"* 是谓.\nQian Zhi notes: The Dunhuang and Fu Yi editions match this stone inscription. *\"Yàomiào\"* 要妙 is also *\"yòumiào\"* 幼妙, synonymous with *\"yōumiào\"* 幽妙. The *Hanshu*, *Annals of Emperor Yuan*, states: \"Exhausting the profound and subtle,\" with Yan Shigu’s note: *\"Yòumiǎo\"* 幼眇 is read as *\"yàomiào\"* 要妙. Liu Taihong says: *\"Yòu\"* 幼 means *\"yōu\"* 幽; *\"miǎo\"* 眇 means *\"wēi\"* 微. The ancient characters *\"yòu\"* 幼 and *\"yǎo\"* 窈 are interchangeable.

Sun Yan’s commentary: \"The deep and dark *\"yǎo\"* 窈.\" (*Hanxue Shiyi*, in *Liu Duanlin’s Collected Works*, volume 7) Thus, *\"yàomiào\"* 要妙 means *\"yōumiào\"* 幽妙.

      "translated_text": "This is indeed the case.\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s rhyme analysis reads: *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解 rhyme (in the *zhi* 支 rhyme group; *zhé* 谪 is pronounced *dí*, *cè* 策 as *chì*, and *jiě* 解 as *jī*). *Shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, and *mí* 迷 rhyme (in the *zhi* 脂 rhyme group).\n\nXī Diāo: *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, *kāi* 开, and *jiě* 解 rhyme; *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, and *mí* 迷 rhyme. *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策 rhyme; *kāi* 开 and *jiě* 解 rhyme; *rén* 人, *rén* 人, *wù* 物, and *wù* 物 rhyme; *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *shī* 师, *zī* 资, *mí* 迷, and *miào* 妙 rhyme.\n\nGāo Běnhàn and Chén Zhù: *jì* 迹, *zé* 則, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解 rhyme, though *jì* 迹 does not rhyme. *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策, *kāi* 开 and *jiě* 解 are divided into two rhyme groups, in agreement with Chén.\n\nDèng Tíngzhēn: *jì* 迹 and *zé* 則—\nZhū Jùnshēng states: The character *cè* 策 in the *Laozi* is skillfully used to rhyme with *jì* 迹, *zhé* 谪, *cè* 策, and *jiě* 解.\nJiāng Yǒugào says: *Jiě* 解 has three pronunciations: *húmǎi*, *jiāmǎi*, and *gǔmǎi*. Given that ancient Chinese had entering tones, it should be grouped with the *mài* 麦 rhyme group. The *Laozi*’s line \"善键无绳约而不可解\" rhymes *jiě* 解 with *jì* 迹 and *cè* 策 (*Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng*, *Twelve Rhymes of the Xiè* 蟹 group). *Zé* 則 and *cè* 策 thus belong to the entering tones of the *zhi* 支 and *jiā* 佳 rhyme groups.\n\nThe *Shījīng*, *Yǐn Wǔ*: \"勿予祸适，稼穑匪解.\" *Shì* 适 and *jiě* 解 rhyme, serving as evidence. Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *Jiě* 解 belongs to the *xiè* 蟹 rhyme group, as the rising tone of the *zhi* 支 and *jiā* 佳 groups.\n\nAs for the first character *jì* 迹 in this chapter, Duàn Yùcái’s *Phonological Tables* also classifies it here, suggesting it should rhyme. However, *jì* 迹 is phoneticized by *yì* 亦, and *yì* 亦’s ancient pronunciation lies in the *yú* 鱼 and *yú* 虞 rhyme groups, not this one. Duàn’s inclusion here stems from the *zhòuwén* 籀文 form of *jì* 迹, written as *sù* 速 (phoneticized by *shù* 束), whose ancient pronunciation lies in this rhyme group. Yet the *Shuōwén* explicitly states \"从辵，亦声,\" making it indisputably a *yú* 鱼/*yú* 虞 rhyme group character. Using the *zhòuwén*’s *shù* 束 phonetic for the small seal’s *yì* 亦-based form feels forced. Thus, I hesitate to treat *jì* 迹 as rhyming and record this discussion here for further inquiry.\n\nUpon closer examination, the opening line should indeed rhyme. Likely, the ancient text used *sù* 速 (from *shù* 束), but later copyists replaced it with the small seal form, inadvertently altering the rhyme. The *Zhōu* 周-era *zhùxiàshǐ* 柱下史 would have recognized only the ancient *zhòuwén* 籀 script. The *Shǐjì*, *Tàishǐgōng Zìxù*: \"桀、纣失其道而汤、武作，周失其道而春秋作，秦失其道而陈涉发迹.\" Here, *jì* 迹 rhymes with *zuò* 作, clearly placing it in the *yú* 鱼/*yú* 虞 rhyme group. Perhaps the *zhòuwén*’s *sù* 速 (from *shù* 束) shifted into the level-tone *zhī* 支 group, while the seal script’s *jì* 迹 (from *yì* 亦) shifted into the level-tone *yú* 鱼 group—reflecting the phonetic divergence between *zhòu* 籀 and seal scripts.\n\nJìn-dynasty Méi Táo’s *Yuàn Shī Xíng* 怨诗行 rhymes *jì* 迹 with *hè* 壑, *kè* 客, and *pò* 魄, showing that post-Hàn usage never placed *jì* 迹 in the *zhī* 支 rhyme group.\n\n**[Textual Notes]**\nThe *Jǐnglóng* 景龙 stele contains eighty-nine characters in this chapter. The Dūnhuáng 敦煌 manuscript lacks the full chapter, leaving the character count unclear. The *Héshànggōng* 河上 and Wáng 王 versions have ninety-one characters; the Fù 傅 version, ninety-seven; the Fàn 范 version omits the eight characters \"而不可开\" and \"而不可解,\" totaling eighty-seven. The *Héshànggōng* version titles it \"巧运第二十七,\" the Wáng version \"二十七章,\" and the Fàn version \"善行章第二十七.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nKnow its masculine, guard its feminine,\nand be the world’s *xī* 溪.\nYán Kějūn states: \"为天下溪\" appears as \"溪\" in all editions.

The *Zhuāngzǐ*, *Tiānxià* 天下 chapter, and *Huáinánzǐ*, *Dào Yìng* 道应 chapter, both quote it as \"溪,\" possibly a later emendation based on a miswritten *Lǎozǐ* character.\n*Xī* 溪, per the *Yùpiān* 玉篇: \"诘难切, identical to *xī* 溪.\" The *Shuōwén*: \"溪: a mountain stream with no outlet, from 谷, phoneticized by 奚.\" While this could symbolize humble virtue, it duplicates the meaning of \"为天下谷\" below. If written as \"蹊,\" it lacks meaning.\nThe Dūnhuáng Dīng manuscript writes \"奚,\" an ancient term for servants or slaves. The *Zhōulǐ*, *Tiānguān* 天官 chapter’s \"序官\" lists \"奚三百人,\" with the note: \"In ancient times, men and women convicted of crimes were enslaved by the state; the more capable were called *xī* 奚.\" \"为天下奚\" thus means \"to be the world’s servant,\" aligning perfectly with the principle of knowing the masculine while guarding the feminine.\nBe the world’s *xī* 溪,\nwith constant virtue unsevered,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Dūnhuáng manuscript omits \"为天下溪.\"\nQiān Zhī’s note: The Suìzhōu 遂州 edition also does not repeat this line; the same applies below.\n\nKnow its brightness, guard its darkness,\nand be the world’s model.\nConstantly attain flawlessness,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nWèi Jiàsūn states: \"为天下式\" is not repeated, likely due to omission, as the preceding \"溪\" and \"谷\" lines are both repeated.

      "translated_text": "\"Note that '贷' is a loan character for '忒.' The *Lǐjì: Yuèlìng* states, '毋有差贷,' meaning 'let there be no deviation or error.' Zhāng Bǐnglín’s *Xīn Fāngyán* says: 'The commentary on *Yuèlìng* reads, \"不贷 means no excess or error. 贷 was originally written as 忒.\" Today, people use 忒 to mean \"excess,\" as in \"too long\" (忒长) or \"too short\" (忒短), and it also corresponds to 泰 in common speech, a shift in pronunciation.'\n\nKnow its glory, guard its disgrace,\nand be the world’s valley.\nBe the world’s valley,\nwith constant attainment of sufficiency,\nreturning to simplicity.\n\nYán Kějūn states: '常得乃足' appears as '常德' in all editions. '于朴' is written as '扑' in the *Yùzhù* version, while Wáng Bì’s edition has '朴,' and the same applies below.\"\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Jǐnglóng and Jǐngfú editions both read '朴,' and the same follows below.\nYì Shùndǐng states: This chapter contains interpolations by later hands and does not entirely reflect the original text of Lǎozǐ. The *Zhuāngzǐ: Tiānxià* quotes Lǎodān as saying: 'Know its masculinity, guard its femininity, and be the world’s stream. Know its brightness, guard its disgrace, and be the world’s valley.' This is the original text of Lǎozǐ. It originally paired 'femininity' with 'masculinity' and 'disgrace' with 'brightness.' Disgrace carries the meaning of blackness, as seen in the *Yílǐ* commentary: 'To dye white into black is called disgrace.' This preserves an ancient meaning. Later scholars, unaware that 'disgrace' could pair with 'brightness,' assumed only 'black' could oppose 'brightness' and only 'glory' could oppose 'disgrace.' Thus, they inserted 'guard its blackness' after 'know its brightness' and added 'know its glory' before 'guard its disgrace.' They further appended four lines—'be the world’s model, be the world’s model, with constant virtue unerring, returning to the boundless'—to harmonize with the 'black' rhyme, making the alterations glaringly obvious.\n\nThe first clear sign is their ignorance of the ancient pairing of 'disgrace' with 'brightness,' a usage from the Zhōu to Hàn dynasties. The second is the inconsistency of 'be the world’s model' with 'be the world’s stream' and 'be the world’s valley.' 'Stream' and 'valley' share the same meaning, both referring to where water converges, whereas 'model' does not align with them, yet it was forced into rhyme. Wáng Bì already provided commentary for the 'model' and related lines, indicating the interpolation occurred as early as the Wèi and Jìn dynasties. Fortunately, the *Zhuāngzǐ* quotation allows us to reconstruct the original text, which should be urgently corrected to preserve its authentic form.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs it to become a leader of officials.\nYán Kějūn states: In all editions, '散' is followed by '则.' In all editions, '用' is followed by '之则.'\nNote: '朴' appears as '璞' in some versions. The *Yùpiān* quotes Lǎozǐ: 'When 璞 scatters, it becomes vessels.' The *Wénxuǎn: Yǎn Liánzhū* commentary cites *Shīzǐ*: 'The people of Zhèng call unworked jade 璞.'\nThus, the great system remains uncarved.\nYán Kějūn states: All editions read '故大制不割.'\nLuó Zhènyù says: The Dūnhuáng manuscript has '制' as '剬.' '无' in the current Wáng Bì edition appears as '不,' matching the *Yùzhù* and Jǐngfú editions. The *Shìwén* notes '无割,' confirming Wáng Bì’s original text read '无,' which is here restored. The Jǐnglóng and Dūnhuáng editions both read '是以大制无割.'\nNote: The reading '无割' is correct. The Fù and Fàn editions also have '无' instead of '不.'\nFàn Yīngyuán states: 'Yán Zūn and Wáng Bì follow the ancient text, while Hé Shànggōng and popular editions read \"不割.\"'\nYì Shùndǐng states: '不割' should be '无割.' Wáng Bì’s commentary—'with the world’s heart as one’s heart, thus remaining uncarved'—confirms his text read '无.' The *Dàoyìng Xùnzhèng* also reads '大制无割.' The current '不' is a later alteration, influenced by the phrase '方而不割' in the following chapter.\"\n\n[Phonology]\nThis chapter’s rhyme scheme, according to Jiāng Shì:\n- *cī* (雌), *xī* (溪), *xī* (溪), *lí* (离), *ér* (儿) rhyme (歌 and 支 in harmony, *lí* approximates *lí* 黎).\n- *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *tè* (忒), *jí* (极) rhyme (之部, *hēi* read as *hū lì* 反, *tè* as *tā lì* 反).\n- *rǔ* (辱), *gǔ* (谷), *gǔ* (谷), *zú* (足), *pǔ* (朴) rhyme (侯部).\nNote: *cī* (雌), *xī* (溪), *ér* (儿) belong to the 支部; *lí* (离) to the 歌部. 歌 and 支 harmonize, as detailed in Chapter Ten.\nGāo Běnhàn: *bái* (白), *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *tè* (忒), *jí* (极) rhyme; *qì* (器), *gē* (割) rhyme.\nTakeuchi Yoshio: *bái* (白), *hēi* (黑), *shì* (式), *shì* (式), *jí* (极) rhyme.\nNote: *bái* (白) had an ancient pronunciation of *bó*; some argue it does not rhyme here.

      "translated_text": "King Wang’s commentary states: \"Thus it may be followed but not acted upon, may be penetrated but not grasped.\" Since King Wang’s commentary includes these terms, the original text can be inferred. This is the second piece of evidence.\n\nIn the later chapter sixty-four, it reads: \"Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Therefore, the sage does no acting and so does not ruin, does no grasping and so does not lose.\" \"Does no acting\" corresponds to \"cannot be acted upon,\" and \"does no grasping\" corresponds to \"cannot be grasped.\" Since that passage includes these terms, this passage must as well. This is the third piece of evidence.\n\nClearly, if there is the phrase \"those who grasp it lose it,\" there must first be the phrase \"it cannot be grasped.\" Ma Xulun states: Peng Song引 Huang Maocai曰: \"The world is a sacred vessel—it cannot be acted upon, it cannot be grasped. As for the human body, is it not also a sacred vessel?\" This shows that Huang saw a version containing this sentence.\n\nNote by Qian: The two phrases \"those who act upon it ruin it\" also appear in chapter sixty-four. The *Heguanzi*’s \"Beizhi\" chapter states: \"Thus those who act ruin it; those who govern disorder it.\" This is likely derived from this passage.\n\nNow, things may follow or be followed, may exhale gently or blow forcefully.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"夫物\" (\"now, things\")—all other editions read \"故物\" (\"thus, things\"). Note by Qian: The Suizhou and Dunhuang editions match this stone inscription. Also, for \"或嘘\" (\"or exhale gently\"), the Heshang Gong and *Imperial Commentary* editions read \"或呴,\" Wang Bi reads \"或歔,\" the Jingfu edition reads \"或煦,\" and two Dunhuang editions match this stone. Upon examination, the Dunhuang, Jingfu, and Suizhou editions all read \"或嘘,\" which is correct. \"嘘\" and \"吹\" are mutually defining: \"嘘\" means \"to blow gently,\" from the mouth radical with the sound *xu*; \"吹\" means \"to exhale forcefully,\" from the mouth and yawn radicals. The *Yiqiejing Yinyi* (vol. 80) cites the *Shuowen* as defining \"嘘\" as \"to blow gently.\" Volume 54 first cites Gu Yewang: \"To exhale from the mouth is called *xu*,\" then the *Shuowen*: \"It is also to exhale.\" While \"吹\" and \"嘘\" both involve exhalation, they differ in intensity. Yi Shunding states: \"The original character for '歔' should be '嘘.' Below, '或强或羸' ('may be strong or weak'), '强' and '羸' are opposites, so '嘘' must also oppose '吹.' The *Yupian*’s mouth radical section treats '嘘' and '吹' as interchangeable, following the *Laozi*. It also cites the *Shenglei*: 'Exhaling forcefully is called *chui* (blow); gently is called *xu* (exhale).' This distinction between *chui* and *xu* reflects the *Laozi*’s ancient meaning. The *Yupian* also includes the character '呴,' citing the *Laozi* as '或呴或吹,' matching the Heshang Gong edition—likely a later vulgar character.\"\n\nFu Yi and Fan Yingyuan’s editions read \"噤\" for \"嘘.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"噤\" matches Yan Zun’s ancient edition, which cites the *Chuci*: \"噤闭而不言\" (\"closed mouth, not speaking\"). Note by Qian: The *Shuowen* defines \"噤\" as \"mouth closed.\" The *Chuci* states: \"Closed mouth is called *jin*.\" Its meaning opposes \"吹.\" Xia Song’s *Guwen Sisheng Yun* cites the *Daodejing* with \"吹\" written as ○, and \"吹\" and \"噤\" as opposing terms—this interpretation is also plausible.\n\nMay be strong or weak, may be raised or cast down.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"或嬴\" (\"or weak\")—all other editions read \"或赢.\" For \"或接\" (\"or raised\"), the *Imperial Commentary* and Heshang Gong read \"载,\" Wang Bi and Liang Jianwen read \"挫.\" Luo Zhenyu states: For \"或强\" (\"or strong\"), the Dunhuang edition reads \"强.\" For \"或挫\" (\"or cast down\"), the Heshang Gong, *Imperial Commentary*, and Jingfu editions read \"载,\" while the Jinglong and two Dunhuang editions read \"接.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"或强或锉, 或培或堕\" (\"may be strong or filed down, may be cultivated or toppled\")—Yan Zun, Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Ruan Ji match the ancient edition. Bi Yuan states: \"堕\" is commonly written as \"隳,\" which is incorrect. Yu Yue states: The Heshang Gong edition reads \"载\" for \"挫,\" with the commentary: \"载 means 'secure'; 隳 means 'precarious.'\" Thus \"载\" and \"隳\" form a pair, consistent with the earlier \"或强或羸.\" However, Wang Bi’s edition reads \"挫,\" which does not distinguish two meanings from \"隳.\" I suspect \"挫\" is a corruption of \"在.\" The seal script for \"在\" resembles ○, hence the error. \"或在或隳\" (\"may be present or toppled\") is equivalent to \"或载或隳.\" \"载\" is phonetically related to ○, while \"在\" is related to 才, and \"或\" is also related to ○ (as in the *Zhoufu* stele’s \"○贵不濡\"). Their sounds being identical, they are interchangeable. Takeuchi Yoshio states: Jia Dayin’s *Shuyi* notes: \"Wang’s edition reads '接' or '隳' for this character\" (cited in the Takikawa edition’s margin). This suggests Wang’s edition originally read \"接,\" not \"挫.\" The Jinglong stele also reads \"接.\" However, \"挫\" and \"接\" are not interchangeable. According to Fan Yingyuan’s *Jijie*, Wang’s edition reads \"培\" or \"堕.\" I believe Wang’s edition originally read \"培,\" which was corrupted to \"接,\" then further to \"挫.\" \"培\" shares the same meaning as in the *Zhuangzi*’s \"培风\" (\"riding the wind\"), signifying \"to ride\" or \"to raise,\" directly opposing \"隳.\" The Heshang Gong edition’s \"载\" also means \"to ride,\" suggesting it was altered based on semantic interpretation. Yu Xingwu states: \"接\" should be read as \"捷\" (\"agile\"). \"接\" and \"捷\" are homophonous and rhyming characters.",
      "overlap_context": "aracter *夫* is present in Ruan Ji’s edition, matching the ancient text.\"\n\nYi Shunding says: Below \"it cannot be acted upon,\" there should be the sentence \"it cannot be grasped.\" I present three pieces of evidence to clarify this. The *Wen Xuan*'s \"General Discussion of the Jin Annals\" by Gan Ling升 quotes *Wenzi* citing Laozi: \"The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped, it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\" This is the first piece of evidence.",

      "translated_text": "The *Liji·Neize* states, \"接以大牢,\" with the annotation: \"接 is read as 捷.\" In the *Gongyang Zhuan* for the thirty-second year of Duke Xi, \"郑伯接卒\" appears, while the *Zuozhuan* and *Guliang Zhuan* write \"捷.\" In the twelfth year of Duke Zhuang of the *Zuozhuan*, \"宋万弒其君捷\" is recorded, whereas the *Gongyang* writes \"接.\" The *Xunzi·Dalüe* states, \"先事虑事谓之接,\" with the annotation: \"接 is read as 捷.\" In the *Zhuangzi·Renjian Shi*, \"王公必将乘人而斗其捷,\" the *Shiwen* notes: \"捷 is written as 接.\" The *Erya·Shigu* defines: \"捷 means victory.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"The defeat of a city wall is called 隓, in seal script.\" Thus, 堕 carries the meaning of defeat, while 捷 signifies victory—these two stand in direct opposition.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character \"○\" in the stele is an alternative form of \"隳.\" Furthermore, Yu Yue’s view that \"载\" and \"隳\" are opposites, Takeuchi’s view that \"培\" and \"隳\" are opposites, and Yu Xingwu’s view that \"捷\" and \"堕\" are opposites—each of these interpretations clarifies a different aspect, and all are plausible, though Yu’s is the most compelling.\n\nThus, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Hanfeizi·Waichu Shuo Zuoxia* quotes it as \"故君子去泰，去甚.\" The character \"甚,\" as explained in Heshang Gong’s commentary, refers to \"excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures,\" which is correct. The *Shuowen* states: \"甚 means extreme contentment, composed of 甘 (sweetness) and 匹 (pair). 匹 signifies coupling.\" Zhu Junsheng remarks: \"甘 pertains to food and drink, 匹 to male and female—these are humanity’s greatest desires, hence the gloss of extreme contentment.\"\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun Du* reads the rhymes as 随, 吹, 羸, and 堕 (all in the 歌 *ge* rhyme group; 吹 is pronounced *cuo*, 羸 as *luo*, and 堕 in the level tone). Xi Diao notes: \"羸\" follows Fan Yingyuan’s edition as \"锉,\" with 随, 吹, 锉, and 堕 forming a rhyme. Deng Tingzhen states: 随, 吹, 羸, and 隓 rhyme, all being ancient 歌 *ge*-group characters. \"随\" was pronounced *suohe* in antiquity, as in the *Lunyu*, where the names of the Eight Disciples rhyme \"随\" with \"騧.\" \"吹\" was pronounced *qu’e*, as in the *Shijing*’s \"风其吹女,\" rhyming with \"和.\" \"羸\" and \"嬴\" share the same pronunciation. \"隓,\" in the modern text of the *Shangshu*’s \"Gaoyao,\" rhymes with \"脞\" and \"惰.\" The character \"‰\" was read similarly in antiquity.\n\nThe Jinglong stele does not divide chapters; it contains fifty-seven characters, matching the Dunhuang version. The Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions have fifty-eight characters, while the Fu Yi and Fan Yingyuan editions have sixty. The Heshang Gong edition titles this \"无为第二十九\" (*Wuwei*, Chapter 29), the Wang Bi edition \"二十九章\" (Chapter 29), and the Fan Yingyuan edition \"将欲章第二十九\" (*Jiang Yu*, Chapter 29).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 30**\nOne who governs as a ruler through the Dao does not rely on military force to dominate the world.\n\nYan Kejun states: \"以道作\" appears as \"以道佐\" in all other editions. Luo Zhenyu notes: The Jingfu edition omits \"者,\" and \"强\" is followed by \"于.\" The Dunhuang edition writes \"强\" as \"强,\" also including \"于.\" Ma Xulun remarks: Wang Bi’s commentary states, \"尚不可以兵强于天下,\" indicating his edition also included \"于.\" Tōjō Ichidō observes: The *Chen Gui*’s *Shou Dao* chapter quotes \"强\" with \"于,\" aligning with Wang Bi’s commentary. Yu Yue argues: The Jinglong stele reads \"以道作人主者,\" which is the ancient version. Heshang Gong’s commentary states, \"谓人主能以道自辅佐也,\" confirming his edition also used \"作.\" If it were \"以道佐人主,\" it would imply a minister aiding the ruler with the Dao—how could this refer to the ruler governing through the Dao? The error arose from the similarity of \"作\" and \"佐,\" compounded by the commentary’s use of \"辅佐.\" Wang Bi’s edition already had \"佐,\" hence his note: \"以道佐人主，尚不可以兵强于天下，况人主躬于道者乎?\" Later editors altered Heshang Gong’s edition to match Wang Bi’s, obscuring the original meaning of Heshang Gong’s commentary.\n\nJiang Xichang contends: No one else has mentioned the Jinglong stele’s \"以道作人主者,\" suggesting Yu Yue’s copy may have been an accidental scribal error, insufficient as evidence.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Zhuang’s argument is incorrect. The original rubbing of the Jinglong stele, as recorded in the *Jiyu Tang Beilu* and *Guben Daodejing Jiaokan Tubo*, along with Yan Kejun’s collation notes, all confirm \"以道作人主者.\" The stele still exists, leaving no room for doubt regarding Yu Yue’s claim. Luo Zhenyu, in his *Daodejing Kaoyi*, wrote: \"In Tieqiao’s *Man Gao*, there is a letter to Xu Xingbo stating, 'While compiling the *Laozi Tangben Kaoyi*, I collated the Yizhou edition, Fu Yi’s edition, the Minghuang commentary edition, and the *Shiwen*—I know Tieqiao once produced a separate collation based on Tang inscriptions.' Yet after thirty years of searching, I could not find it.\" Jiang’s skepticism likely stems from not having seen Yan Kejun’s work or the Jinglong stele, illustrating the challenges of textual scholarship.\n\n**Its consequences will rebound:**\nWei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary omits \"好还,\" and Yan Kejun missed this in his collation.\n\nQian Zhi notes: \"还\" in the *Shiwen* is pronounced *xuan*.

These likely represent a commentary intruding into the main text, which this edition omits. Wang [Shihan] cites the Xingzhou edition as also lacking them.\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: Both the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit the above nine characters.\n\nLao Jian states: The two lines \"大军之后，必有凶年\" (*After a great army passes, lean years must follow*) are absent from the Jinglong, Dunhuang, and Daozang Longxing stele editions, though present in all others.

      "original_text": "严可均曰：「故善者果而已」，河上、王弼无「故」字，大典亦无「故」字，「而已」下有「矣」字。 今王弼「者」作「有」。 「不以取强」，各本「不」下有「敢」字。 罗振玉曰：景龙、御注、敦煌、景福诸本均作「故善者果而已」，广明本作「善者果而已矣」。 「不敢以取强」，景龙本、敦煌本均无「敢」字。 「强」，敦煌本作「强」，景福本句末有「焉」字。 俞樾曰：按「敢」字衍文。 河上注曰：「不以果敢取强大之名也。 」注中「不以」二字，即本经文。 其「果敢」字乃释上文「果」字之义，非此文又有「果」字也。 今作「不敢以取强」，即涉河上注而衍。 王注曰：「不以兵力取强于天下也。 」亦「不以」二字连文，可证经文「敢」字之衍。 唐景龙碑正作「不以取强」，当据以订正。 果而勿骄，果而勿矜，果而勿伐， 严可均曰：御注「骄」作「憍」。 各本「果而勿骄」句在「果而勿伐」下。 谦之案：遂州、敦煌、景福三本「果而勿骄」亦在「果而勿矜」之前。 又「骄」，范本、楼正本亦作「憍」。 杨树达曰：「憍」字从心，乃「骄傲」之「骄」本字，但说文未收耳。 「骄」则「憍」之假字。 果而不得以，是果而勿强。 严可均曰：「果而不得以是」，各本「以」作「已」，无「是」。 魏稼孙曰：按御注「已」下有「是」字，与碑同。 俞樾曰：按傅奕本作「是果而勿强」，当从之。 上文云「善者果而已，不以取强」，又云「果而勿矜，果而勿伐，果而勿骄，果而不得已」，皆言其果，不言其强。 故总之曰「是果而勿强」，正与上文「果而已，不以取强」相应。 读者误谓此句与「果而勿矜」诸句一律，遂妄删「是」字耳。 唐景龙碑亦有「是」字，当据增。 谦之案：广雅释诂一：「果，信也。 」论语：「行必果。 」缪协曰：「成也。 」淮南道应训「令不果往」，注：「诚也。 」老子：「善有果而已。 」盖以诚信为果之第一义，谓唯诚信可以得人，不必用兵也。 旧解以「敢」字释「果」，不知老子以「不敢」为教，「勇于敢则杀，勇于不敢则活」，「敢」非老子古义，在此且为衍文。 果而勿骄，勿矜，勿伐，皆言诚信之功效如此。 老子书中最重「信」字，四十九章：「信者，吾信之； 不信者，吾亦信之，德信。 」十七章、二十三章：「信不足，有不信。 」果即信也。 信不足而至于用兵，是「果而不得已」，然亦以告成事而已。 王弼注：「果犹济也。 」此为果之第二义。 左传宣十二年，楚庄王曰：「其为先君宫，告成事而已，武非吾功也。 」此即「果而勿强」也。 用兵而寓于不得已，是视胜犹不胜，不以兵强天下者也。 蒋锡昌误解老子，谓「果在能杀敌人」，是杀人犯，非老子也。 物牡则老，谓之非道，非道早已。 严可均曰：御注、河上、王弼作「是谓不道，不道早已」； 傅奕、王氏引邢州本皆作「非道」。 魏稼孙曰：御注「牡」作「壮」，与德经一句同。 德经句，碑亦作「牡」，此「牡」字误。 严失校。 谦之案：此三句亦见五十五章，碑本于此作「非道」，于彼作「不道」。 河上本作「不道」，遂州本全句：「物壮则老，谓非道早已。 」案「非道」即「不道」。 「已」一作「亡」，顾欢本「不道早亡」，注：「亡，死也。",
      "translated_text": "Yan Kejun states: *\"Thus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop\"*—the Heshang Gong and Wang Bi editions omit the character *gu* (故, \"thus\"), and the *Dayian* edition likewise omits it, while adding *yi* (矣) after *er yi* (而已). In Wang Bi’s edition, *zhe* (者) is written as *you* (有). *\"Never resorting to force\"*—all versions include *gan* (敢, \"dare\") after *bu* (不).\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong, imperial commentary, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions all read *\"Thus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop,\"* while the Guangming edition has *\"The virtuous achieve their ends and stop.\"* *\"Never dare to resort to force\"*—the Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit *gan* (敢). In the Dunhuang edition, *qiang* (强, \"force\") is written as *qiang* (强), and the Jingfu edition adds *yan* (焉) at the end of the sentence.\n\nYu Yue comments: The character *gan* (敢) is a superfluous interpolation. Heshang Gong’s commentary states: *\"Not using resolute daring to seize the reputation of strength.\"* The *\"not using\"* in the commentary is drawn from the original text. The *\"resolute daring\"* explains the meaning of *guo* (果, \"achieve\") above and does not imply another *guo* (果) in this passage. The current reading *\"never dare to resort to force\"* is an interpolation influenced by Heshang Gong’s commentary. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: *\"Not using military power to impose strength upon the world,\"* where *\"not using\"* is also a continuous phrase, further proving that *gan* (敢) in the original text is superfluous. The Tang-dynasty Jinglong stele correctly reads *\"never resorting to force,\"* and this should be adopted for emendation.\n\n*\"Having achieved their ends, they do not boast; having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: In the imperial commentary, *jiao* (骄, \"boast\") is written as *jiao* (憍). In all versions, the line *\"having achieved their ends, they do not boast\"* appears after *\"having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt.\"*\n\nQian Zhi notes: The Suizhou, Dunhuang, and Jingfu editions also place *\"having achieved their ends, they do not boast\"* before *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt.\"* Additionally, *jiao* (骄) is written as *jiao* (憍) in the Fan and Lou Zheng editions. Yang Shuda remarks: The character *jiao* (憍) is written with the heart radical and is the original form of *jiao* (骄, \"pride\"), though it is not included in the *Shuowen*. *Jiao* (骄) is thus a borrowed character for *jiao* (憍).\n\n*\"Having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully—this is achieving their ends without resorting to force.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: *\"Having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—in all versions, *yi* (以) is written as *yi* (已), and *shi* (是) is omitted. Wei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary includes *shi* (是) after *yi* (已), matching the stele. Yu Yue comments: The Fu Yi edition reads *\"this is achieving their ends without resorting to force,\"* which should be followed. The preceding lines state *\"the virtuous achieve their ends and stop, never resorting to force,\"* and *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not flaunt; having achieved their ends, they do not boast; having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—all emphasize *guo* (果, \"achievement\") without mentioning *qiang* (强, \"force\"). Thus, the summary *\"this is achieving their ends without resorting to force\"* directly corresponds to the earlier *\"achieve their ends and stop, never resorting to force.\"* Readers mistakenly assumed this line followed the same pattern as *\"having achieved their ends, they do not vaunt,\"* leading them to erroneously delete *shi* (是). The Tang-dynasty Jinglong stele also includes *shi* (是), and it should be restored.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* states: *\"Guo* (果) means *xin* (信, 'trust').\"* The *Analects* reads: *\"Act with certainty.\"* Miao Xie explains: *\"Guo* means *cheng* (成, 'fulfillment').\"* The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* states *\"the order was not carried out,\"* with the commentary: *\"Guo* means *cheng* (诚, 'sincerity').\"* Laozi’s *\"the virtuous achieve their ends and stop\"* suggests that *guo* (果) primarily signifies *chengxin* (诚信, \"sincerity and trust\"), meaning only sincerity can win people over without resorting to force. Earlier interpretations glossed *guo* (果) as *gan* (敢, \"daring\"), failing to recognize that Laozi teaches *\"not daring\"*—*\"daring leads to destruction, while not daring leads to life.\"* *Gan* (敢) is not Laozi’s original meaning and is superfluous here. *\"Having achieved their ends, they do not boast; they do not vaunt; they do not flaunt\"* all describe the effects of sincerity and trust. Laozi’s text most emphasizes *xin* (信, \"trust\"). Chapter 49 states: *\"Those who are trustworthy, I trust; those who are untrustworthy, I also trust—this is virtuous trust.\"* Chapters 17 and 23 state: *\"Insufficient trust leads to distrust.\"* Resorting to force due to insufficient trust is *\"having achieved their ends, they do not act willfully\"*—yet this is merely to fulfill the task. Wang Bi’s commentary reads: *\"Guo* means *ji* (济, 'to accomplish').\"* This is the secondary meaning of *guo* (果). The *Zuozhuan*’s 12th year of Duke Xuan records King Zhuang of Chu saying: *\"It is for the former ruler’s palace, to fulfill the task—military success is not my achievement.\"* This is *\"having achieved their ends without resorting to force.\"* Using force only when unavoidable is to regard victory as no victory, never imposing strength upon the world through arms. Jiang Xichang misunderstood Laozi, claiming *\"guo* means the ability to kill enemies\"*—this is the way of a murderer, not Laozi.\n\n*\"When things become aggressive, they age—this is called contrary to the Dao; what is contrary to the Dao perishes early.\"*\n\nYan Kejun states: The imperial commentary, Heshang Gong, and Wang Bi editions read *\"this is called contrary to the Dao; what is contrary to the Dao perishes early,\"* while the Fu Yi edition and Wang’s citation of the Xingzhou edition both read *\"non-Dao.\"* Wei Jiasun notes: The imperial commentary writes *mu* (牡, \"aggressive\") as *zhuang* (壮, \"strong\"), matching a line in the *De Jing*. The stele also writes *mu* (牡) in that line, but here *mu* (牡) is an error. Yan’s collation is incomplete.\n\nQian Zhi notes: These three lines also appear in Chapter 55. The stele reads *\"non-Dao\"* here and *\"contrary to the Dao\"* there. The Heshang Gong edition reads *\"contrary to the Dao,\"* while the Suizhou edition has the full line: *\"When things become strong, they age—this is called non-Dao, perishing early.\"* *\"Non-Dao\"* is equivalent to *\"contrary to the Dao.\"* *Yi* (已) is also written as *wang* (亡, \"perish\"). The Gu Huan edition reads *\"contrary to the Dao, perishing early,\"* with the commentary: *\"Wang* means *si* (死, 'death').\"*",
      "overlap_context": "oist scripture.\"* This likely refers to the two lines beginning with *\"Where the army encamps,\"* supporting Lao’s argument. Additionally, the Guangming edition writes *xiong* (凶, \"lean\") as *huang* (荒, \"barren\"), while the imperial commentary uses *xiong* (凶). The *Shiwen* glosses *\"lean years\"* as: *\"Heaven responds with malign qi, disasters befall the five grains, and all people suffer.\"* This collation is appended here.\n\nThus, the virtuous achieve their ends and stop—never resorting to force.",

      "translated_text": "Within the *Huangdi Neijing*, Volume One, Wang Bing’s annotation also reads *\"contrary to the Dao, perishing early,\"* suggesting the ancient text likely wrote *wang* (亡). Furthermore, Yao Nai states: *\"The twelve characters 'When things become strong, they age' are superfluous, having been mistakenly inserted here under the line 'Do not be aggressive' by reciters, when they properly belong below the line 'The heart that drives qi is called forceful' in the 'Embodying Virtue' chapter of the later section.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nFor this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Rhyme Reading* pairs:\n- *zhe* (者) and *xia* (下) as rhymes (Fish Department, *zhe* read as *zhu*),\n- *huan* (还), *yan* (焉), and *nian* (年) as rhymes (Yuan and Zhen Departments in mixed rhyme, *huan* read as *xuan*, *nian* rhyming with *nulian*).\n\nQian Zhi notes: *huan* and *yan* belong to the Yuan Department, while *nian* belongs to the Zhen Department—this is a mixed rhyme of Yuan and Zhen.\n\nXi Tong pairs *jin* (矜) and *qiang* (强) as rhymes, citing as examples the *Yi Lin* (*Kun* hexagram’s *Lü* line rhyming *liang* and *jin*, *Bi* hexagram’s *Zhong Fu* line rhyming *jin* and *xiang*). He also pairs *lao* (老), *Dao* (道), and *yi* (已) as rhymes, a view shared by Gao Benhan.\n\nGao takes *zhu* (主), *xia* (下), *chu* (处), and *hou* (后) as rhymes, with *huan*, *yan*, and *nian* as secondary rhymes.\n\nQian Zhi notes: *zhu*, *xia*, *chu*, and *hou* do not rhyme—Gao’s claim is erroneous.\n\nThe Jinglong Stele version contains sixty-seven characters; the Dunhuang version matches it. The Heshang Gong and Wang [Bing] editions have seventy-five characters, the Fu [Yi] edition seventy-nine, and the Fan [Yingyuan] edition seventy-eight. The Heshang Gong edition titles this chapter *\"Frugality and Martiality, Thirty,\"* the Wang edition *\"Chapter Thirty,\"* and the Fan edition *\"Using the Dao to Assist the Ruler, Chapter Thirty.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\n*\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: The Heshang Gong edition omits the character *zhe* (者). In *\"inauspicious tools,\"* the *Datian* edition lacks the two characters *\"zhi qi\"* (之器).\n\nQian Zhi notes: The character *jia* (佳) appears as *mei* (美, \"fine\") in Fu Yi’s edition, as *shi* (饰, \"adorned\") in the Muromachi edition, and as *\"fine and good weapons are inauspicious tools\"* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Biography of Cang Gong*—all later glosses. Song Xiangfeng argues: *\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools\"* should read *\"crafting weapons\"* (*zuo bing*). The *Da Dai Liji*’s *\"On the Use of Arms\"* states: *\"To use arms—is this not inauspicious?\"* and further: *\"The Duke asked, 'Did Chiyou craft weapons?' The Master replied, 'No. Chiyou was a greedy commoner—what tools could he have made?'\"*—evidence for *\"crafting weapons.\"* Some take *jia* as *zhui* (隹), interchangeable with *wei* (惟). The seal script forms of *jia* and *zuo* (作) are close, while *zhui* is distant—it should not be read as *zhui*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: The meaning of *\"crafting weapons\"* is also unclear; *jia* should indeed be *zhui*. The Yuan Dynasty’s third year (1309) *Daoist Canon* stele at the Panxi Palace in Baoji County, Shaanxi, writes *jia* as *zhui*—proof (see *Collated Rubbings of Ancient Daoist Canon Versions*).\n\nAdditionally, the two characters *\"zhi qi\"* (之器) are absent in Wu Cheng’s and Wu Mianxue’s editions.\n\nWang Niansun states: The *Shiwen* glosses *jia* as *\"good,\"* while Heshang Gong reads it as *\"adorned.\"* Neither gloss is satisfactory. In antiquity, *\"weapons\"* referred specifically to the Five Arms, hence the saying: *\"Weapons are inauspicious tools.\"* If referring to those who wield arms, one may call them inauspicious, but not *\"inauspicious tools.\"* Here, *jia* should be *zhui*, a scribal error. *Zhui* is the ancient form of *wei* (唯, \"only\")—*wei* may also be written as *wei* (惟) or *wei* (维). *\"Only weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* thus the Daoist does not dwell with them. Above it says *\"only\"* (*fu wei*), below *\"thus\"* (*gu*)—the meaning aligns perfectly. Chapter Eight states: *\"Only through non-contention does one avoid blame.\"* Chapter Fifteen says: *\"Only because it cannot be known is it called profound\"* and *\"Only through non-fullness can one remain whole without renewal.\"* Chapter Twenty-Two declares: *\"Only through non-contention does the world not contend with them.\"* All serve as evidence. In ancient bronze and stone inscriptions, *wei* is written as *zhui*, as in the Stone Drums. The *Ancient Script Four-Tone Rhymes* by Xia Song also records *wei* in the *Dao De Jing* as *zhui*. Thus, all instances of *wei* in modern texts were altered by later hands. Had *zhui* not been mistaken for *jia*, later scholars would surely have changed it to *wei*.\n\nRuan Yuan states: In the *Dao De Jing*, *\"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* *jia* is a corruption of *zhui* (同惟). The *Dao De Jing* frequently pairs *\"fu wei\"* (夫唯) as a phrase; if read as *jia*, it should say *\"inauspicious affairs,\"* not *\"tools\"* (*Preface to the Exegesis of Classical and Historical Words*).\n\n*\"Some revile them—thus the Daoist does not dwell with them.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: All editions include *zhe* (者) after *Dao*, and the *Datian* edition adds *ye* (也) after *chu* (处).\n\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong and Dunhuang editions both omit *zhe*.\n\nQian Zhi notes: Chen Xianggu’s *Authentic Exegesis of the Dao De Jing* lacks these two lines.\n\n*\"The noble person values the left in residence, but in warfare, values the right.\"*\n\nNakai Riken states: The ancients all valued the right, hence demotion was called *\"left transfer\"*—there is no evidence of valuing the left, even in the Han. Later officials who valued the left began with the Five Hu’s disruption of China. The Hu valued the left, as their customs dictated (see *Laozi*’s *\"tattooed foreheads\"*).\n\nQian Zhi notes: This is incorrect. The *Zuozhuan*’s eighth year of Duke Huan states: *\"The Chu people esteem the left,\"* aligning with the *Dao De Jing*’s *\"The noble person values the left in residence\"* and *\"Auspicious affairs esteem the left.\"*",

The *Shiwen* lists *\"tranquil\"* (澹), noting: *\"Alternatively written as 'indifferent' (惔).\"* Bi Yuan states: The *Shuowen* defines *\"placid\"* (憺) as *\"calm, from the heart, with zhān as phonetic\"* and *\"indifferent\"* (惔) as *\"anxious, from the heart, with yán as phonetic.\"* The *Book of Songs* says: *\"My anxious heart burns like fire.\"* Thus, *\"indifferent\"* (惔) is incorrect.",

Yet this chapter contains Laozi’s profound insights, aligning with the later passage *\"when opposing armies clash, the grieving side prevails.\"* I fail to understand why Chao deemed this erroneous. However, the chapter’s phrasing is somewhat redundant, suggesting ancient commentary may have been mistakenly included. The line *\"stating that one should handle it with mourning rites\"*—with its *\"stating\"*—resembles a commentator’s gloss.\n\nTan Xian notes: An earlier scholar observed that the eight characters *\"after great warfare, there must be famine years\"* were commentary mistakenly inserted. I believe the three lines *\"the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general stands on the right, stating that one should handle it with mourning rites\"* are also commentary. The Yizhou stone edition and *Taiping Imperial Digest* omit *\"stating that one should handle it with mourning rites.\"*\n\nYan Kejun notes: *\"Sorrowful\"* appears as *\"grieving\"* in the Wang Bi edition.\n\nQian Zhi observes: The Daozang Wang Bi edition reads *\"sorrowful,\"* which may be used to correct the text. Additionally, *\"weeping\"* has been suggested to be a corruption of *\"preside\"* (莅).\n\nLuo Yunxian states: *\"Weeping\"* should be emended to *\"preside\"* (莅). The *Shuowen* lacks *\"preside\"* (莅), but this character appears in this text’s thirty-second chapter, as well as in the *Rites of Zhou*, *Zuozhuan*, and *Zhuangzi*.

Though this chapter contains many interpolations from ancient commentaries, phrases such as *\"Now, weapons are inauspicious tools,\"* *\"Slaying multitudes, govern it with sorrow and grief,\"* and *\"Victorious in war, handle it with mourning rites\"* remain timeless insights—utterances no one but Laozi would dare or could articulate.\n\nHere, I have excised redundancies and emended the received text as follows:\n\nNow, weapons are inauspicious tools—\n*(Weapons are inauspicious tools, not the instruments of the noble person.)*\nThings may despise them, thus one who embodies the Way does not dwell in them.\n*(When their use is unavoidable, equanimity is paramount.)*\n\nThe noble person, in repose, values the left; in warfare, values the right.\n*(Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs, the right.

Fan Ye’s version reads \"Should kings and lords hold fast to it,\" while the various Wang Bi editions read \"Should lords and kings hold fast to it.\" Other versions omit the character \"之,\" and all render \"kings and lords\" as \"lords and kings.\" The *Shiwen* states: \"Liang Wu reads 'kings and lords.'\" The characters \"lords\" and \"hold fast\" naturally harmonize within the verse’s rhyme, as in Chapter Forty-Two’s \"kings and dukes take it as their measure,\" where \"dukes\" and \"measure\" rhyme similarly—thus, it should read \"kings and lords.\" Qian Zhixi comments: \"Kings and lords\" is correct.

The Muromachi edition includes \"焉\" after \"levels.\" Yi Shunding remarks: The Tang dynasty’s Han E’s *Suihua Jili* cites it as \"the people do not unite it, yet it levels itself\"—\"command\" is likely a corruption of \"unite.\" \"Do not unite it\" conveys the meaning of letting things take their natural course. The text states that when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends of itself; if the people do not unite it, it still levels itself—this illustrates the efficacy of non-action. Qian Zhixi comments: The *Yupian* defines \"level\" as \"even\" or \"equal.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"level their provisions\" glosses \"level\" as \"adjust.\" The *Zilin* defines \"level\" as \"field.\" Here, \"none command it, yet it levels itself\" reflects the primitive communist society of antiquity, echoing Chapter Fifty-One’s \"none command it, yet it constantly follows its nature.\" The readings \"command,\" \"unite,\" and \"enjoin\" are all plausible, though \"command\" here represents the original text.)*\n\nWhen systems begin, names arise.\nOnce names exist,\nheaven too will know when to halt.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: \"Heaven too will know when to halt\"—the Yu annotation and Wang Bi read \"then too will know when to halt,\" while Heshang Gong reads \"then too will know it.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Jinglong version reads \"heaven\" for \"then,\" omitting \"too.\" The Jingfu version reads \"heaven\" for \"then,\" including \"too.\" Qian Zhixi comments: \"Heaven\" is a scribal error. The Song-dynasty Heshang Gong edition and the Muromachi version both reflect this. Bai Yuchan notes: \"One version reads 'heaven too will know it,' and the following line matches.\" Bi Yuan remarks: \"Heshang Gong reads 'heaven too will know when to halt.'\" The error has persisted for some time. The Guangming edition’s \"then\" is partially missing, and Wu Yun mistakenly emends it to \"heaven,\" noting: \"'Heaven'—Fu Yi’s version reads 'then,' as does the Yizhou edition.\" He fails to recognize that \"heaven\" is a corruption of \"then.\" Wang Bi, Fu Yi, and Fan Ye all read \"then.\" Fan Yingyuan states: \"'Then too will know when to halt'—Ma Dan and Wang Bi follow the ancient text.\" This reading should be adopted.)*\n\nKnowing when to halt averts peril.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: The Yu annotation reads \"knowing when to halt is why there is no peril,\" Heshang Gong reads \"knowing it is why there is no peril,\" and Wang Bi reads \"knowing when to halt can avert peril.\" Lu Zhenyu observes: The Yu annotation, Jingfu, and British Library versions include \"is why,\" while the Jinglong and Dunhuang versions omit these characters. Yu Yue remarks: The Tang dynasty’s Jinglong stele omits \"can,\" which is correct. Wang Bi’s commentary states: \"Knowing when to halt is why there is no peril.\" The addition of \"is why\" completes the sentence, but scribes mistakenly incorporated it into the main text, leading Heshang Gong to read \"knowing it is why there is no peril.\" Here, \"can\" is a corruption of \"is why.\" Qian Zhixi comments: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition reads \"is why.\" The *Juzhen* palace edition reads \"can,\" which is a corruption of \"is why.\" Yu Yue’s explanation is sound.)*\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: Heshang Gong and Wang Bi include the character \"之\" after \"Dao.\")*",

      "translated_text": "The phrase \"与江海\" appears in the *Yu zhu* and Heshang Gong versions as \"之与江海,\" while Wang Bi’s version reads \"之于江海.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The *Yu zhu*, *Jingfu*, and British Library editions all read \"之与,\" whereas the Jinglong and Dunhuang versions simply read \"与.\" Yi Shunding states: Wang Bi’s commentary says, \"like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas,\" indicating that the main text \"于江海\" should read \"与江海.\" The *Mouzi* quotes this passage as: \"The Dao’s presence in the world is like valleys and streams flowing to rivers and seas,\" where the character is correctly written as \"与.\" Jiang Xichang remarks: The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition reads \"与\" instead of \"于,\" and this should be adopted as the correct version. These two characters were interchangeable in ancient texts, as noted in *Jingyi Shuwenn* and *Jingzhuan Shici.*\n\n**[Phonology]**\nIn this chapter, Jiang Yong’s *Yun du* reads the rhymes as follows: *ming* (名), *chen* (臣), *bin* (宾), and *jun* (均) rhyme (with *geng* and *zhen* as interchangeable rhymes); *you* (有), *zhi* (止), *dai* (殆), and *hai* (海) rhyme (in the *zhi* rhyme group). Xi Tong’s analysis aligns: *chen* (臣), *bin* (宾), and *jun* (均) rhyme, while *you* (有), *zhi* (止), *zhi* (止), *dai* (殆), and *hai* (海) rhyme. Qian Zhi notes: *Chen* (臣) and *bin* (宾) belong to the *zhen* rhyme group, *ming* (名) to the *geng* group, and *jun* (均) is shared between *zhen* and *geng*, providing evidence of *geng* and *zhen* rhyme interchange. The *Li Sao* also rhymes *ming* (名) and *jun* (均), which Xi Tong did not address. Takeuchi Yoshio’s edition reads *zhi* (之) instead of *zhi* (止), stating: \"The two instances of *ming* (名) in '无名' and '有名' rhyme, while the intervening thirty-five characters—from '朴虽小' onward—rhyme *chen* (臣) and *bin* (宾). The *zhi* (之) character forms a separate rhyme, suggesting a possible textual displacement. Compare this with the three lines beginning '名亦既有,' where *you* (有), *zhi* (之), and *dai* (殆) rhyme.\" However, Takeuchi likely did not recognize the interchangeability of *geng* and *zhen* rhymes. Wang Niansun notes: *Zhi* (止) rhymes with *you* (有), with *you* (有) pronounced similarly to *yi* (以) in the *Book of Songs* and *Chu Ci* (*Dushu Zazhi*, juan 3–4).\n\nThe Jinglong stele version does not divide this passage into chapters, comprising sixty-four characters. The Dunhuang version has sixty-five, the Heshang Gong version seventy, and the Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan versions seventy-one. The Heshang Gong edition titles this \"Sacred Virtue, Chapter Thirty-Two,\" while the Wang Bi edition titles it \"Chapter Thirty-Two,\" and the Fan edition titles it \"The Dao Is Eternally Nameless, Chapter Thirty-Two.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is clarity.\n*(Qian Zhi notes: The Fu and Fan editions include the particle \"也\" at the end of each line. Fan Yingyuan states: \"Ancient editions included '也' at the end of each line, lending the text a measured cadence. Later editions omit these particles, but from '不失其所者久' onward, the absence of '也' leaves the phrasing incomplete. This edition follows the ancient version.\" Qian Zhi counters: Fan’s claim is incorrect. Ancient editions of the *Laozi* varied in detail, influenced by regional linguistic and cultural differences across the Northern and Southern Dynasties. As Yan Zhitui’s *Yanshi Jiaxun* (*On Literary Evidence*) observes: \"Particles such as *ye* (也), *shi* (是), *yu* (语), *yi* (已), and other grammatical markers appear in texts, but Northern traditions often omit them.\" \"Moreover, some vulgar scholars, upon encountering the occasional *ye* (也) in classical texts, arbitrarily alter them.\" Among extant editions, Southern versions tend toward elaboration, while Northern versions are more concise. The elaborate versions, such as the Fu and Fan editions—where this chapter includes *ye* (也) at the end of each line—were likely modified arbitrarily. This distinction must be recognized. Additionally, the *Hanfeizi* (*Illustrating the Laozi*) reads \"自见之谓明,\" but Wang Xianshen notes: \"'自见' in the *Laozi* is '自知.' The *Daodejing*’s '自知' follows '知人者智也,' and no edition reads '见.' This '见' is likely a scribal error, conflating the two preceding instances of '见.' It should follow the *Laozi* and read '知.'\" Qian Zhi adds: The *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, Pei Songzhi’s commentary, and Yu Fan’s *Zhouyi Jijie* (under *Zhen*) all quote this line as \"自知者明,\" confirming that \"知\" is correct. The phrase \"自见之谓明\" contradicts Chapter Twenty-Four’s \"自见者不明.\")*\n\nTo overcome others is power;\nto overcome oneself is strength.\n*(Wei Jiashun notes: The *Yu zhu* includes \"者\" after \"人.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The Dunhuang edition writes \"强\" as \"强,\" and the same applies to \"强行\" below. Qian Zhi notes: The Heshang Gong, Wang Bi, Fu, and Fan editions all include \"者\" after \"人.\" Yu Fan’s *Zhouyi Jijie* (under *Kun*) also includes \"者.\" The *Hanfeizi* (*Illustrating the Laozi*) reads \"自胜之谓强.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Preceding Oneself*) states: \"Thus, to overcome others, one must first overcome oneself; to know others, one must first know oneself.\" The *Self-Knowledge* chapter adds: \"Survival and ruin, safety and danger—do not seek them externally; focus on self-knowledge... No failure is greater than lacking self-knowledge.\" These variations all derive from the *Laozi* but alter its phrasing.)*\n\nTo be content is wealth;\nto act with resolve is purpose.\n*(Yan Kejun notes: All editions include \"者\" after \"行.\" Luo Zhenyu notes: The Jinglong and Dunhuang editions omit \"者.\" Qian Zhi notes: The *Qunshu Zhiyao* (juan 34) includes \"则\" after \"行者,\" and the Muromachi edition includes \"者\" after \"行.\")*",

      "translated_text": "To not lose one’s place is to endure;\nto die yet not perish is to attain longevity.\n\n*(Qian Zhi notes: All things have their proper place. The *Hanfeizi* (*Difficulties of Power*, citing Master Shen) states: “The flying dragon rides the clouds, the soaring serpent glides through the mist; when the clouds disperse and the mist clears, dragon and serpent become as worms and ants”—this speaks of losing one’s place. To not lose one’s place is like the *Yi*’s *Gen* hexagram, which says: “*Gen* means stillness. To still when it is time to still, to act when it is time to act—movement and rest do not lose their timing, and one’s Dao shines forth.” It also says: “Stillness in *Gen* is stillness in one’s proper place.” The *Mozi* (*Canon*, Part I) likewise states: “Stillness endures.” All express this principle. Yi Shunding notes: The *Yilin* reads “perish” as “delusion.” To “die yet not be deluded” means to perish rightly. Though the *Heshang Gong* edition also writes “perish,” its commentary says: “Eyes do not see delusion, ears do not hear delusion, the mouth does not speak delusion—thus one incurs no resentment under Heaven and attains longevity.” This too reads “perish” as “delusion.” Qian Zhi notes: The Muromachi old manuscript and the *Zhongdu Sizi* edition both write “delusion” for “perish.” The *Yilin* (juan 1) and *Qunshu Zhiyao* (juan 30) cite the *Daodejing* as “to die yet not be deluded is to attain longevity,” both including the *Heshang Gong* commentary, showing that the ancient edition he saw also wrote “delusion.” “Perish” and “delusion” were interchangeable in antiquity.)*\n\n*[Phonology]*\n*(This chapter’s rhymes, per Jiang Yong: “bright” and “strong” rhyme (yang group); “wealth” and “purpose” rhyme (zhi group); “endure” and “longevity” rhyme (zhi and you groups in communication, with “endure” rhyming as “nine”). Qian Zhi notes: “Endure” belongs to the zhi group, “longevity” to the you group—this is a case of zhi and you in communication. Yao Wentian and Xi Dong concur. Deng Tingzhen: “Wealth,” “purpose,” and “endure” rhyme. Karlgren and Chen Zhu: “Wealth,” “purpose,” “endure,” and “longevity” form a single rhyme. Deng Tingzhen says: “Wealth,” “purpose,” and “endure” rhyme. “Wealth” in ancient pronunciation was like *bei*. The *Shuowen* states: “Wealth means abundance.” In the *Book of Songs*, it appears five times, and in the *Yi*, three times—all rhyming with zhi and hai group words. “Endure” in ancient pronunciation was like *ji*. In the *Book of Songs*, it appears three times, and in the *Yi*, twice—all rhyming with zhi and hai group words. Below, “to die yet not perish is to attain longevity” makes “endure” rhyme with “wealth” and “purpose” above while also rhyming with “longevity” below, reflecting the gradual phonetic shifts of the late Zhou. He further notes: “Endure” in antiquity was read like *ji*. In the *Book of Songs*, “Mao Qiu” (II) rhymes with “with”; “Liu Yue” (final stanza) rhymes with “joy,” “blessing,” “friend,” “carp,” and “alas”; “Liao E” (III) rhymes with “shame” and “rely.” Characters phoneticized with “endure” include: in “Mu Gua,” “jade” and “black jade” rhyme with “plum”; in “Qiu Zhong You Ma,” “pendant” and “black jade” rhyme with “plum” and “child”; in “Cai Wei,” “great” and “grief” rhyme with “come”; in “Di Du,” “great” and “black jade” rhyme with “come”; in “Da Dong,” “heart’s grief” rhymes with “come”; in “Zhao Min,” “today’s grief” rhymes with “wealth,” “time,” and “this.” Thus, characters with the “endure” phonetic clearly belong to the zhi and hai groups. In the *Yi*, the only rhymes are in the *Jiji* hexagram commentary, where “endure” rhymes with “weary,” “doubt,” “time,” and “come,” and in the *Miscellaneous Hexagrams*, where “constant and enduring” rhymes with “moderation and stillness.” Elsewhere, the *Lin* hexagram commentary rhymes with “Dao”; the *Qian* hexagram commentary rhymes with “Dao,” “fault,” “creation,” and “head”; the *Daguo* hexagram commentary rhymes with “ugly” and “fault”; and the *Li* hexagram commentary rhymes with “fault” and “Dao”—all matching modern rhymes. As phonetic patterns shift with time, by the time Confucius commented on the *Yi*, the sounds had already slightly changed, sometimes aligning with the *Songs* and sometimes not. In the *Laozi*, “to not be endangered is to endure long,” “endure” rhymes with “endangered.” “Having the mother of the state, one can endure long,” “endure” rhymes with “mother.” Both match the *Songs*. “To be content is wealth; to act with resolve is purpose; to not lose one’s place is to endure; to die yet not perish is to attain longevity”—here, “endure” rhymes with “wealth” and “purpose,” consistent with the *Songs*, while the following phrase also rhymes with “longevity,” aligning with the *Yi*. Such pronunciations existed at the time, and no single theory can encompass them all. The *Shuowen* under “black jade” quotes the *Book of Songs*: “Bestow upon me a black jade pendant.”)*",

The Daoist Canon’s Wang Bi edition writes *fàn*, with the commentary also using *fàn*. The Daoist Canon’s *Collected Commentaries of Four Masters* cites Wang Bi’s commentary as *fàn*. The Fu Yi edition writes *fànfàn xī*, while the Fan Yingyuan edition writes *sìsì xī*. Writing *sì* rhymes with *yòu*, *cí*, *yǒu*, and *zhǔ*; writing *fàn* also conveys the meaning. Ma Xulun states: The characters *fàn* and *fàn* were interchangeable in ancient times. The *Liji*’s \"Wang Zhi\" chapter reads, \"*Fàn* is shared with all,\" and the *Shiwen* notes, \"*Fàn* is also written as *fàn*—this is an example.\" The *Shuowen* defines *fàn* as \"overflowing\" and *fàn* as \"floating in appearance.\" The two meanings differ, and *fàn* is the correct choice.\n\nAll things depend on it for life yet do not refuse,\nYan Kejun notes: \"For life\" (*yǐ shēng*) appears as \"and live\" (*ér shēng*) in the *Heshang* edition.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, Dunhuang, and British Library editions all write *yǐ* instead of *ér*.\nQian Zhian observes: Liu Xiaobiao’s commentary on the *Bianming Lun* also writes *yǐ shēng*, as do the *Dayian*, Fu Yi, and Fan Yingyuan editions.\nYi Shunding states: The *Wenxuan*’s *Bianming Lun* commentary cites it as \"All things obtain it for life yet do not refuse\" and further quotes Wang Bi’s commentary: \"All things attain the Dao and live.\" Thus, the current character *shì* (\"depend\") is likely a corruption of *dé* (\"obtain\").\n\nTheir achievements are not claimed as possession.\nYan Kejun notes: \"Achievements\" (*chénggōng*) appears as \"accomplished merits\" (*gōng chéng*) in other editions. \"Not claimed as possession\" (*bù míng yǒu*) appears as \"and do not dwell\" (*ér bù jū*) in the Fu Yi and *Dayian* editions.\nQian Zhian observes: The *Guangming* edition includes the particle *ér* after *chéng*, as does the *Jingfu* edition. The *Shimochō* edition writes \"accomplished merits and do not claim possession\" (*gōng chéng ér bù míng yǒu*), while the Zhao Mengfu and Wang Xizhi editions write \"accomplished merits do not dwell\" (*gōng chéng bù jū*).\nYi Shunding states: The *Bianming Lun* commentary cites, \"Accomplished merits are not possessed; they nurture all things yet do not act as master.\" Later, it again quotes Wang Bi’s commentary, confirming this as the Wang Bi edition. Thus, the current Wang Bi edition’s \"accomplished merits are not claimed as possession\" (*gōng chéng bù míng yǒu*) should read \"accomplished merits are not possessed\" (*gōng chéng ér bù yǒu*), with *míng* being a superfluous character.\n\nIt nurtures and sustains all things yet does not act as master.\nYan Kejun notes: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in Wang Bi’s edition and as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the *Dayian* edition. \"Does not act as master\" (*bù wéi zhǔ*) in other editions includes the particle *ér* before *bù*, as does the following phrase.\nWu Yun states: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the Fu Yi edition and as \"clothes and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in Wang Bi’s edition. Bi Yuan notes that *yī* (\"clothes\") and *ài* (\"nurture\") are phonetically close—this is correct.\nLuo Zhenyu notes: The *Heshang*, *Jinglong*, *Imperial Commentary*, British Library, *Guangming*, and *Jingfu* editions all write *ài yǎng*, while the Dunhuang edition writes *yī bèi*. The *Jinglong*, Dunhuang, and *Guangming* editions all omit the particle *ér*.\nQian Zhian observes: \"Nurtures and sustains\" (*ài yǎng*) appears as \"clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) in the Wang Xizhi and Fan Yingyuan editions and as \"depends and sustains\" (*yī yǎng*) in the Suizhou edition—all convey the meaning.\nZhu Junsheng states: *Ài* is a loan for *○*. The *Shuowen* defines *○* as \"concealed from sight, from *zhú* (bamboo), phonetic *ài*.\" The *Chuci*’s \"Nine Songs\" reads, \"I dwell in deep bamboo and never see the sky.\" Bamboo excels at concealment, hence the *zhú* radical. The *Book of Songs*’ \"Jing Nü\" uses *ài* for this meaning, and the \"Zheng Min\" poem’s commentary glosses *ài* as \"hidden.\" The *Shuowen* defines *yī* (\"clothing\") as \"that which covers the body,\" also a loan for *ài*. The *Laozi* reads, \"It clothes and sustains all things yet does not act as master.\"\nFan Yingyuan states: \"Clothes and covers\" (*yī bèi*) aligns with Wang Bi’s and Ma Dan’s ancient editions. *Yī bèi* means \"to cover.\" The *Yi Jing*’s Han Kangbo commentary reads, \"It clothes and covers all things, thus manifesting benevolence.\" Cheng Xuanying’s *Laozi* commentary states, \"It clothes and covers all things, molding and nurturing living beings.\" The *Shuowen* defines *yī* as \"to depend.\" The *Shiming* states, \"That on which people depend to shelter from the cold.\" *Yī bèi*, *yī yǎng*, *yī yǎng*, and *ài yǎng* share the same meaning, though *ài yǎng* is particularly apt.\nLi Daochun states: \"Some interpret *ài yǎng* as *yī bèi*—this is incorrect.\"\nYu Yue states: The *Heshang Gong* edition writes *ài yǎng*, while this edition writes *yī yǎng*—an example of ancient character interchangeability.

      "translated_text": "The *Xiaojing*’s *Xun* chapter, as cited by Liu Xuan, states: \"Love is to conceal and cherish within, binding inwardly.\" It does not simply explain *xī* (\"cherish\") but insists on *\"yǐn xī\"* (\"conceal and cherish\"), also using phonetic analogy for instruction. The two characters originally shared the same pronunciation, hence *\"ài yǎng\"* could be written as *\"yī yǎng.\"*\n\nFù Yì’s edition reads *\"yī bèi\"*—this stems from later scholars failing to grasp ancient pronunciation and meaning, recklessly altering the text without foundation.\n\n*\"May be named at the Great\"*—Wei Jiǎosūn states: *\"Not to be the Master, may be named at the Great.\"* The *Yù Zhù* (Imperial Commentary) inserts before *\"kě\"* (\"may\") and after *\"zhǔ\"* (\"Master\"): *\"If ever without desire, may be named at the Small; all things return to it, yet it does not claim to be the Master\"*—fifteen characters in total. According to my examination, the *Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng* editions read *\"guī zhī\"* (\"return to it\") as *\"guī yān ér\"* (\"return to it and\"), totaling sixteen characters. Fù and Fàn’s editions read: *\"Thus, if ever without desire, may be named at the Small—Fàn’s edition reads 'for the Small'—all things return to it and yet do not know the Master\"*—seventeen characters in total. The *Dunhuang* and *Suìzhōu* editions, along with *Gù Huān’s* edition, omit the *\"cháng wú yù\"* (\"ever without desire\") trio; the rest align closely with the *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions. The *Yīnglún* and *Dunhuang* editions read *\"yān\"* as *\"zhī.\"* The *\"ér\"* (\"and\") character is absent in the *Yù Zhù* and *Dunhuang* editions. These three sentences were overlooked by Yán Kějūn.\n\nFurther examination reveals these three sentences were unlikely part of the original *Laozi* text. *\"If ever without desire, may be named at the Small\"* likely served as an ancient annotation to Chapter One’s *\"cháng wú, yù guān qí miào\"* (\"ever without, desiring to observe its subtlety\"). *Fǎyán’s* *\"Xiào zhì\"* chapter, annotated by Lǐ Guǐ, states: *\"The Dao reaches the utmost subtlety, hence it is called 'Small.'\"*\" Here, it becomes redundant. The omission of *\"cháng wú yù\"* in the *Dunhuang* and *Suìzhōu* editions confirms this. The phrase *\"may be named at the Small\"* pairs with *\"may be named at the Great,\"* yet logically, nurturing all things could be called \"Great,\" not \"Small.\" The repetition of *\"all things return to it and yet do not claim to be the Master\"* with the preceding *\"nurturing all things yet not claiming to be the Master\"* suggests redundancy, warranting deletion. This further supports the theory of interpolated ancient annotations. Cross-referencing with the *Jīnglóng* stele, which lacks these three sentences, strengthens this conclusion over other editions.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: The *Héshàng Gōng* edition reads *\"wéi dà\"* (\"for the Great\"), while the *Dàtǐan* edition reads *\"yú dà yǐ\"* (\"at the Great indeed\"), and includes *\"Thus, the Sage could accomplish its Greatness.\"* In my examination, *\"yú\"* (\"at\") and *\"wéi\"* (\"for\") shared ancient pronunciations, making *\"yú dà\"* equivalent to *\"wéi dà.\"* This *\"dà\"* corresponds to Chapter Twenty-Five’s *\"qiáng wéi zhī míng yuē dà\"* (\"forcibly naming it 'Great'\"). Fù’s edition reads *\"kě míng yú dà yǐ,\"* while Fàn’s reads *\"kě míng wéi dà yǐ\"*—both convey the same meaning. Thus, the Sage never claims to be Great, yet accomplishes its Greatness.\n\nYán Kějūn states: *\"Terminally not for the Great,\"* with the *Héshàng Gōng* edition ending the sentence with *\"yě\"* (\"indeed\"), while Wáng Bì reads *\"yǐ qí zhōng bù wéi dà\"* (\"since it terminally does not claim to be Great\"), and the *Dàtǐan* reads *\"yǐ qí bù zì dà\"* (\"since it does not exalt itself\"). Luó Zhènyù notes that the *Héshàng Gōng*, *Jīnglóng*, *Dunhuang*, *Yù Zhù*, *Jīngfú*, and *Yīnglún* editions uniformly read: *\"Thus, the Sage terminally does not claim to be Great.\"* In my examination, Wáng Xīzhī’s edition inserts *\"yě yǐ qí bù zì dà\"* (\"indeed since it does not exalt itself\") before *\"gù\"* (\"thus\") and after *\"dà\"* (\"Great\"), matching Wáng Bì’s version, while Fàn’s edition reads *\"shì yǐ shèngrén yǐ qí zhōng bù zì wéi dà\"* (\"Thus, the Sage since it terminally does not claim to be Great\"), citing *\"Yán Zhēn, Wáng Bì identical to the ancient edition.\"*\n\n**[Phonology]** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading for this chapter: *\"yòu\"* (right), *\"cí\"* (words) rhyme (zhī department, *yòu* with variant pronunciation, *cí*, departing tone), *\"jū\"* (reside), *\"zhǔ\"* (Master) rhyme (hóu, yú interchangeable rhymes, *jū*, departing tone, *zhǔ* harmonizing with *zhū*). In my examination, *jū* belongs to the *yú* department, while *zhǔ* belongs to the *hóu* department—an example of *hóu* and *yú* interchangeable rhymes. The original *\"jū\"* was *\"yǒu\"* (have). Chén Zhù notes: *\"yòu, cí, yǒu, zhǔ\"* rhyme; *\"dà\"* (great) rhymes in triple repetition. Gāo Běn Hàn and Wǔnèi Yìyǒng note: *\"yòu, cí, yǒu\"* rhyme. Additionally, the *\"dào sì\"* edition also reads *\"fàn\"* (drift), while Fàn Yìngyuán states *\"sì\"* sounds like *\"fàn\"*—incorrect. *\"Sì\"* should sound like *\"jì\"* (record). In this chapter, *\"sì, yòu, cí, yǒu, zhǔ\"* form the rhyme, mirroring the *Chūcí’s* *\"Tiānwèn\"* where *\"sì, huì, lǐ\"* rhyme. Jiāng Yǒuguī states: *\"cí\"* is pronounced *\"zī\"* (like \"this\"). According to ancient usage, departing tones merged in *zhì* and *zhì* departments.\n\nThe *Jīnglóng* stele comprises forty-four characters, the *Dunhuang* edition fifty-five, the *Héshàng* edition sixty-two, the *Wáng* edition sixty-one, the *Fù* edition seventy-three, and the *Fàn* edition sixty-nine.

The *Yù Zhù* annotates *\"xiàng\"* as *\"○\"* (omitted). *\"Xiàng\"* is borrowed for *\"xiàng\"* (likeness), as in the *Yì Jīng’s* *\"Xìshí\"* (\"Systematic Pivot\"): *\"Seeing, it is called *xiàng*.\"* *\"Dà xiàng\"* thus means the \"Great Likeness.\" Chéng Xuānyīng’s annotation confirms: *\"The Great Image is like the law of the Great Dao.\"* Moving without harm, serene and boundless.\n\nYán Kějūn states: *\"Tài\"* (great), the *Yù Zhù* and *Dàtǐan* editions read *\"tài\"* as *\"tài\"* (great/serene).

      "translated_text": "The text proceeds as follows:\n\n*\"According to the old saying: ‘An’ means ‘quiet.’ The *Shìmíng* (Explanation of Names) states: ‘An, that is *yàn* (tranquil).’* Tranquil and harmonious, without fear or agitation. *Píng* (serene) is the ultimate of *ān* (tranquil), and *tài* (serene) is the ultimate of *píng* (serene). Thus, ‘*ān píng tài*’ is a parallel construction.\n\nKing Yinzhi (*Wáng Yǐnzhī*) in his *Jīngchuán Shìcí* (Exegesis of Classical Texts) disagrees, arguing: ‘*Ān* means “thus,” “therefore,” or “then.” The *Lǎozǐ* says: *“Moving without harm, serene and boundless.”* This means that only when one moves without harm does one attain *píng* and *tài* (serene).’\n\n*Lè yǔ è*, the passing guest is stopped.\nWhen the Dao speaks, it is bland and tasteless.\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Dào chū yán”* (the Dao’s utterance) is recorded in the *Yù Zhù* and *Héshàng* editions as *“Dào zhī chūkǒu”* (the Dao’s utterance from its mouth), while Fù Yì’s edition reads *“Dào zhī chūyán”* (the Dao’s utterance). Below, the phrases *“shì”*, *“tīng”*, and *“yòng”* in all editions include the particle *“zhī”* (the). *“Dàn wú wèi”* (bland and tasteless) has *“hū qí”* (how its) inserted after *“dàn”* (bland) in all editions. Luó Zhènyù states that the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript reads *“yán”* (speech) for *“kǒu”* (mouth) and *“dàn”* (bland) as *“tàn”* (dim), omitting *“hū qí”*. In my examination, the *Wáng Xīshì* and *Fàn* editions also read *“yán”* for *“kǒu”*. Fàn states: *“Chūyán”* (utterance) aligns with the ancient text as per Wáng Bì’s reading. Thus, the *Wáng* edition also reads *“chūyán”*. Tōng Jīotō states: *“Dào zhī chūkǒu”* (the Dao’s utterance from its mouth) has *“kǒu”* (mouth) written as *“yán”* (speech) in ancient and stele editions. I confirm that both this annotation and the annotation of Chapter 23 use *“chūyán”*. The *Shìwén* (Explanatory Text) reads *“chǐlèi fǎn”* (rhyming with *lèi*). Examining all evidence, it is clear that the *Wáng* edition’s text reads *“chūyán”*. Those reading *“kǒu”* (mouth) likely omit the upper stroke. Hé Yàn’s annotation in the *Jǐngfú Diàn Fù* also reads *“chūyán”*. Táohóngqìng states that Fù Yì’s edition reads *“chūkǒu”* as *“chūyán”*. According to Wáng’s annotation: *“The Dao’s utterance is bland and tasteless.”* In Chapter 23, *“Xīyán zìrán”* (rarely speaking naturally), it is stated: *“The next chapter speaks of the Dao’s utterance, bland and tasteless.”* This suggests his edition aligns with Fù Yì’s. Perhaps *“yán”* (speech) was corrupted into *“kǒu”* (mouth)?\n\n*Sight is insufficient to see it; hearing is insufficient to hear it; use is insufficient to exhaust it.*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Yòng bùkě jì”* (use cannot exhaust) is recorded in the *Yù Zhù* and *Héshàng* editions as *“Yòng zhī bùkě jì”* (use cannot exhaust it), while Wáng Bì’s edition reads *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”* (use cannot fully exhaust). Wèi Jiàosūn states: *“Shì zhī bùjiàn”* (sight cannot see), with *“bù”* (not) preceded by *“zhī”* (the) in the *Yù Zhù*, and similarly below. *“Yòng bùkě jì”*—according to the *Yù Zhù*, the character *“jì”* (exhaust) is omitted. Luó Zhènyù states that the *Jǐnglóng* and *Dūnhuáng* manuscripts lack *“zhī”* (the). In my examination, the *Jǐngfú*, *Pánxī*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Shìmáchéng*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Zhào Mèngfǔ*, and *Gāoxì* editions all include *“zhī”* (the). Additionally, the *Yǒnglè Dàtǐan* *Wáng* edition reads *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”*, while other *Wáng* editions read *“bùkě”* (cannot) for *“bùzú”* (not fully). The *Fù*, *Fàn*, *Suìzhōu*, *Shìmáchéng*, and *Zhōngdū sìzǐ* editions also read *“bùkě”*, matching this stone inscription.\n\nFurther, referring to the *Shuōwén* (Explanatory Script): *“Jì”* (exhaust) means *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal), with the phonetic *“qí”* (旡). The *Yùbiǎn* (Jade Edition) under *“qí”* states: *“Jì, resident-yiè cut”*, meaning *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal) and *“yǐ”* (already). Luó Yùnxián states: *“Yòng zhī bùzú jì”*—referring to the *Shuōwén*: *“Jì”* (exhaust) means *“xiǎoshí”* (small meal). The preceding text states that *lè* (music) and *è* (bait) can stop passing guests, but the Dao is different. Music can be heard, bait can be seen and eaten, yet the Dao cannot be seen, heard, or consumed. Hence: *“Sight cannot see it; hearing cannot hear it; use cannot exhaust it.”* Old annotations interpret *“jì”* as *“jìn”* (exhaust), failing to grasp ancient meanings, thus failing to rhyme properly. *(This is the sole remnant of ancient meaning.)*\n\nYáng Shùdá states: *“Lè yǔ è”* (music and bait) refers to delighting in drinking and eating. *“Lè”* (music) is pronounced *“luò”* (洛), not referring to music.\n\n**Phonology:** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading:\n- *Xiàng* (image), *wǎng* (move) – *yáng* (阳) department,\n- *Hài* (harm), *tài* (serene) – *jì* (祭) department (*hài* as *húliè fǎn*, *tài* as *tāliè fǎn*),\n- *È* (bait), *zhǐ* (stop) – *zhī* (之) department,\n- *Wèi* (taste), *jiàn* (see), *jì* (exhaust) – *zhǐ* (脂) and *yuán* (元) merged department.\n\nIn my examination: *Wèi* (taste), *jì* (exhaust) belong to the *zhǐ* (脂) department, while *jiàn* (see) belongs to the *yuán* (元) department, thus merging *zhǐ* and *yuán*. Dèng Tíngzhēn and Xí Dòng state: *Wèi* (taste), *jì* (exhaust) rhyme. Jiāng Yǒuguì states: *“È”* (bait) is pronounced *“lìngshì”* (仍吏), as ancient texts had an upper-voice tone, aligning with the *zhǐ* department. In the *Lǎozǐ Réndé* (Ren德 chapter), *“Lè yǔ è”* (music and bait) rhymes with *“zhǐ”* (stop).\n\nTo the right: The *Jǐnglóng* stele edition has 37 characters, matching the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript. The *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions have 43 characters, while the *Fù* and *Fàn* editions have 44. The *Héshàng* edition is titled *“Réndé”* (Ren德, Chapter 35), the *Wáng* edition *“Sānshíwǔ zhāng”* (Chapter 35), and the *Fàn* edition *“Zhí Dàxiàng zhāng”* (Chapter on Grasping the Great Likeness, 35).\n\n**Chapter 36:**\n*Jiāng yù xī zhī, bì gù zhāng zhī;*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *“Xī zhī”* (close it) is recorded in the *Héshàng* edition as *“zhī”* (it), while Wáng Bì’s edition reads *“○ zhī”* (omitted *zhī*). Jiǎnwén’s edition reads *“shì zhī”* (close it) and *“jǐ zhī”* (give it). *“Bì gù”* (must open) is recorded in all editions as *“bì gù”* (must firmly), and similarly below.\n\nIn my examination, *“xī”* (close) is correct. Both *Fù* and *Fàn* editions read *“xī”*. Fàn states: *“Xī”* means *“liǎn”* (gather), *“hé”* (unite), *“jù”* (assemble). Wáng Bì aligns with the ancient text. Thus, the *Wáng* edition also reads *“xī”*, though the current text reads *“shì”* (close).",

In my examination, Fù, Fàn, *Suìzhōu*, Xíng Xuán, Qìngyáng, Pánxī, Lóu Zhèngjūn’s editions read *\"tài\"* as *\"tái\"* (serene), while the *Héshàng* and *Wáng* editions read *\"tài\"* (great), and the *Dàozàng Wáng* edition reads *\"dà\"* (great). *\"Tái\"* and *\"tài\"* were interchangeable in ancient usage.",

      "translated_text": "The *Shuowen Jiezi* (Explanatory Text of Written Characters) records that the *Shuowen* edition reads *“Jiāng yù ○ zhī”*, confirming that the *Shuowen* version of the *Wang* edition had *“○”* omitted. The Dunhuang, Jingfu, and Muromachi editions all read *“”*.\n\nBì Yìn remarked: *“There were no characters ‘’ or ‘○’ in antiquity.*” The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: *“Xī (歙): to contract the nostrils.”* Since *“xī”* carries the meaning of contraction, it appropriately opposes *“zhāng”* (expand). Gù Huān followed this, deriving the sense of closure as well. *“Xī”* (翕) was less commonly used in ancient script.\n\nTakeuchi Yoshio declared: *“According to the Tianwen Chao (天文钞) and the Jinglong Stele (景龙碑), the Heshang edition reads ‘xī’ (翕). The Wang Bi edition seen by Fan Yingyuan also reads ‘xī.’ The *Hanfei zi* (韓非子) *Youlao* (喻老) chapter likewise cites it identically. It appears that both the Wang and Heshang editions originally read ‘xī,’ but later scribes altered the Wang edition to ‘○’ or ‘xī’ (歙), while the Heshang edition was changed to ‘’.*\n\n**Chapter 36 (continued):**\n*Jiāng yù ruò zhī, bì gù qiáng zhī;*\n*Jiāng yù cuì zhī, bì gù xīng zhī;*\n*Jiāng yù duó zhī, bì gù yǔ zhī.*\n*Shì wèi wēi míng.*\n\nWei Jiaosun noted: *“Bì gù”* in *“bì gù qiáng zhī”* and *“bì gù xīng zhī”* is written *“bì gù”*, while in *“bì gù yǔ zhī”* it is *“bì gù”*.

In this chapter, *“yuān”* and *“rén”* rhyme—it should read *“yuān.”* The character *“quán”* was a Tang-dynasty alteration to avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozu’s name, changing *“yuān”* to *“quán.”* Hàn Fēi’s *“Yù Lǎo”* passage reads: *“Gùyuē, ‘yú bùkě tuō yú shēn yuān.’”* Wáng Xiānshèn commented: *“Shēn is a redundant character.

*Wèidū* (Capital of Wei) annotation cites *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi”* (上德无为而无不为),\nmatching the *Fù* and *Fàn* editions.\n\n**Fàn Yìngyuán** states:\n*“Shàngdé wúwéi”* (上德无为) and the following two

(上德无为而无以为，下德为之而有以为).\nNow we follow the ancient edition.\n\n**Yú Yì** states:\n*“Wú”* (无), in the *Han Feizi* *“Jiě Lǎo” (Explanation of Laozi)*,\nis written as *“wú bùwéi”* (无不为).\nThis likely reflects the ancient edition of *Laozi*,\nwhereas the current reading *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) is a mistake influenced by the *“shàngrén”* (上仁) line below.\nThe *Fù Yì* edition correctly reads *“bù”* (不).\n\n**Qián Zhī’àn’s annotation**:\nThe stele reads *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为), which is correct.\nAll agree that *Jiāng Yǒuguǎng*’s *Lǎozǐ Jiějiě* (Explanations of Laozi) states:\n*“One edition reads: ‘上德无为而无不为，下德为之而无以为’ (Shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi, xiàdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi),\nlikely following the *Chǔ* (褚) edition.”*\nThe *Chǔ* edition refers to the *Dàodéjīng* calligraphied by *Jìn* *Wáng Yòujūn* (王右军),\nwith a *Chǔ Suìliáng* (褚遂良) postscript from *Zhēnguān* 15 (贞观十五年).\nThus, it is known that *Wáng Xīzhī*’s (王羲之) edition aligns with the *Fù* edition’s correctness.\nHowever, *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi”* (上德无为而无以为) is superior in meaning\nto *“shàngdé wúwéi ér wú bùwéi”* (上德无为而无不为).\nThe *Tàishàng* (Most High) knows what exists,\nthus does nothing and yet achieves completion—\nas in **Chapter 57**: *“wǒ wúwéi ér mín zìhuà”* (我无为而民自化).\n*“Wúwéi”* (无为) and *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) seem indistinguishable,\nyet *“wúwéi ér wú yǐwéi”* (无为而无以为) and *“wúwéi ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (无为而有以为) differ greatly.\nThe *Fù* and *Fàn* editions’ *“xiàdé wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (下德为之而无以为)\ncompared to the stele’s *“xiàdé wúwéi ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (下德无为而有以为),\nthe *Fù* and *Fàn* editions’ *“xiàdé”* (下德) aligns

Though it does not lose its virtue, within the realm of *Wuwei*, there remains still a means of action. **Qian Zhi** notes: Mǎ’s reasoning is correct.\n\nChapter sixty-three states: *“Wuwei is done.”* It means *Wuwei* yet there is still a means of action. *“Shàngrén wéizhī ér wú yǐwéi”* (上仁为之而无以为), *“shàngyì wéizhī ér yǒu yǐwéi”* (上义为之而有以为). **Qian Zhi** notes: The preceding text takes *“wúwéi”* (无为) as its core, distinguishing *“wú yǐwéi”* (无以为) and *“yǒu yǐwéi”* (有以为); *Shàngdé* (上德) has *“wú yǐwéi”*, while *Xiàdé* (下德) has *“yǒu yǐwéi”*. This passage takes *“wéizhī”* (为之) as its core, distinguishing *“wú yǐwéi”* and *“yǒu yǐwéi”*; *Shàngrén* (上仁) has *“wú yǐwéi”*, while *Shàngyì* (上义) has *“yǒu yǐwéi”*.\n\nThe *Fàn* edition aligns with this, but the *Fù* edition changes *“shàngyì”* (上义) to *“xiàyì”* (下义), which is incorrect. *“Shànglǐ wéizhī ér mò zhī yìng”* (上礼为之而莫之应), then *“rǎng bì ér céng zhī”* (则攘臂而仍之). **Bì Qián** states: *“Céng”* (仍), the *Wáng Bì* edition renders as *“rēng”* (扔). **Qian Zhi** notes: The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *“céng”* (仍) as *“to follow or persist”*. *“Rēng”* (扔) also means *“to persist”* or *“to follow”*, as seen in the *“Rēng Shì”* (扔氏) of the *Xià Shí* (夏时). **Qian Zhi** notes: The editions from *Yùzhù* (御注), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), and *Lóuzhèng* (楼正) stone texts, as well as the copies by *Yán Zūn* (严遵), *Fù Yì* (傅奕), *Nài Juàn* (柰卷), *Shìtáng* (室町), *Gù* (顾), and *Péng* (彭), all render *“céng”* (仍). The *Fàn* edition renders *“rēng”* (扔), which is correct. The *Guǎng Yǎ* (广雅) states: *“Rēng”* (扔) means *“to pull or drag”*, and the *Guǎng Yùn* (广韵) defines it as *“to forcefully pull or drag”*. *“Rēng”* (扔) and *“céng”* (仍) share the same pronunciation and meaning, but *“rēng”* (扔) carries the radical *“shǒu”* (手, hand), aligning better with *“rǎng bì”* (攘臂, roll up one’s sleeves).\n\n**Fàn** states: *“Rǎng bì”* (攘臂)—to roll up one’s sleeves and step forward—is *“rǎng”* (攘). *“Rēng”* (扔) is the same as the *Wáng Bì* edition and the ancient texts; the world’s editions render *“céng”* (仍). Now we follow the ancient texts.\n\nThus, one loses the *Dao* and then falls to virtue, loses virtue and then falls to *rén* (仁, benevolence), loses benevolence and then falls to *yì* (义, righteousness), loses righteousness and then falls to *lǐ* (礼, propriety). **Liú Shīpéi** states: The *Hán Fēizǐ* (韩非子) commentary on *Lǎozǐ* (老子) reads: *“Thus it is said: ‘One loses the *Dao* and then falls to losing virtue, loses virtue and then falls to losing benevolence, loses benevolence and then falls to losing righteousness, loses righteousness and then falls to losing propriety.’”* Observing this text, the *Wáng* (王) and *Héshàng* (河上) editions have omitted the four *“shī”* (失, lose) characters.\n\n**Mǎ Xùlún** states: The *Hòuhànshū* (后汉书) commentary on *Cuī Jǐng* (崔骃) omits these four characters, while the commentary on *Zhū Mù* (朱穆) includes them. The *“Fǔxíng Jì”* (辅行记) in its third volume cites even more: *“失礼而后智，失智而后信”* (失义而后失礼, lose propriety and then falls to wisdom; lose wisdom and then falls to trustworthiness), but all editions and the *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) *“Zhīběi Yóu”* (知北游) chapter’s citation match this passage. The *“jiān yì”* (譣义, variant reading) is also inappropriate, as these two additional sentences and the four *“shī”* (失) characters do not fit.\n\n**“Lǐ”** (礼, propriety), as the thin veneer of *zhōngxīn* (忠信, loyalty and trustworthiness), is the origin of disorder. **Yán Kějūn** states: *“Zhōngxīn zhī bó”* (忠信之薄, the thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness), the *Yùzhù* (御注) renders as *“zhī bù”* (之簿). The same applies to *“bù chǔ qí bó”* (不处其薄, not dwelling in its thinness). **Luó Zhènyù** states: *“Shǒu”* (首, origin), the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition adds *“yě”* (也, also).\n\n**Qian Zhi** notes: The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions, as well as the *Shìtáng* (室町) edition, also include *“yě”* (也). **Lǐ Qiào** states: The *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) *“Zhīběi Yóu”* (知北游) chapter’s citation reads *“Lǐ zhě, dào zhī huà ér luàn zhī shǒu yě”* (礼者，道之华而乱之首也, propriety is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of disorder), mistakenly merging the two sentences into one.\n\n**Sòng Xiángfèng** states: The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) wrote this to elucidate the natural governance of the *Huángdì* (黄帝, Yellow Emperor), akin to the *“Lǐyùn”* (礼运) passage *“Dàdào zhī xíng”* (大道之行, the great *Dao* in action). Thus, it prioritizes *dào* (道, *Dao*/Way) and *dé* (德, virtue/power), followed by *rén* (仁, benevolence) and *yì* (义, righteousness). *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius) established the *Liùjīng* (六经, Six Classics), expounding upon the *Dao* of *Yǔ* (禹, Yu), *Tāng* (汤, Tang), *Wén* (文, King Wen), *Wǔ* (武, King Wu), and *Zhōugōng* (周公, Duke Zhou), akin to the *“Lǐyùn”* passage *“Dàdào jì yǐn, tiānxià wéi jiā”* (大道既隐，天下为家, the great *Dao* having hidden, the world becomes a family). Thus, the middle part clarifies *rén* (仁), *yì* (义), *lǐ* (礼), and *zhī* (知, wisdom), to rescue this age.\n\nHence, the teachings of *Huáng* (黄, Yellow) and *Lǎo* (老, *Lǎozǐ*) complement those of *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius). Moreover, he states: *“Lǐ zhě, zhōngxīn zhī bó ér luàn zhī shǒu yě”* (礼者，忠信之薄而乱之首也, propriety is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness and the origin of disorder), indicating that as social customs decay, the *Dao*, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness descend in order, and propriety becomes the means of governing the people. *Luàn* (乱) here means *treatment* or *regulation*. The *Lǎozǐ* (老子) spoke of *lǐ* (礼, propriety), hence *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子, Confucius) inquired about it.\n\n**Qian Zhi** notes: Sòng’s argument is well-reasoned, yet it fails to clarify the source of the teachings, interpreting *“luàn”* (乱) as *“treatment”* or *“regulation”*. Referencing the *Lǐjì* (礼记) *“Lǐyùn”* (礼运) Chapter sixty-four *“Zhì zhī yú wèi luàn”* (治之于未乱, govern before disorder arises), *“zhì”* (治) and *“luàn”* (乱) are paired terms, so *“luàn”* (乱) here should not be interpreted alone as *“treatment”*.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) knew that *lǐ* (礼, propriety) was a superficial adornment of the *Dao* and the beginning of folly, thus he said: *“Chǔ qí hòu, bù chǔ qí bó”* (处其厚，不处其薄, dwell in its thickness, not in its thinness). *“Qiánzhì zhě, dào zhī huà ér yú zhī shǐ”* (前识者，道之华，而愚之始, wisdom is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly). **Qian Zhi** notes: The *Hán Fēizǐ* (韩非子) commentary on *Lǎozǐ* (老子) reads *“Qiánzhì zhě, dào zhī huà yě, ér yú zhī shǒu yě”* (前识者，道之华也，而愚之首也, wisdom is the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly).\n\nThe characters *“qiánzhì”* (前识) are rendered *“qiánzhí”* (前职) by *Yán Zūn* (严遵), with the annotation *“preparatory and orderly”*. Based on the annotation, *“zhí”* (职) is a miswritten character. *“Yú zhī shǐ”* (愚之始, the origin of folly), the *Fù* (傅) edition changes *“shǐ”* (始) to *“shǒu”* (首), and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) annotates *“dào zhī huà ér yú zhī shǒu”* (道之华而愚之首, the adornment of the *Dao* and the origin of folly), indicating that the *Wáng* (王) edition also renders *“shǒu”* (首). The *Fàn* (范) and *Nài Juàn* (柰卷) editions render *“shǐ”* (始).\n\nThe *“Lǐjì”* (礼记) *“Qū Lǐ”* (曲礼) *“Zhèngyì”* (正义) annotation cites: *“Lǐ zhě, zhōngxīn zhī bó, dào dé zhī huà, zhēng yú zhī shǐ”* (礼者忠信之薄，道德之华，争愚之始, propriety is the thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness, the adornment of virtue and *Dao*, and the beginning of folly in contention). **Yì Shùndǐng** states: The cited text has *“dào”* (道) followed by *“dé”* (德), and *“zhēng”* (争) before *“yú”* (愚). I propose *“yú”* (愚) should be *“yù”* (遇, encounter), as in *“Shuō Pángēng”* (盘庚) *“zàn yù jiānmiè”* (暂遇奸宄, temporarily encountering deceitful and wicked people) and *“Huáinán”* (淮南) *“ǒu yù zhìgù”* (偶○智故, occasionally encountering wisdom). The *“Lǚshì Chūnqiū”* (吕氏春秋) *“Wùgōng”* (勿躬) passage *“yōuxuì yúxiǎn zhī yán”* (幽诡愚险之言, obscure, deceptive, foolish, and treacherous words), *Wángshì Jīngyì Shùwén* (王氏经义述闻) interprets *“yú”* (愚) as *“yù”* (遇).",

      "translated_text": "「愚」 and 「遇」 were interchangeable in ancient usage—this text follows that tradition as well. **The beginning of foolishness is the beginning of deceit.** Thus, the true gentleman dwells in substance, not in adornment; he rests in reality, not in superficiality. Therefore, he rejects the latter and embraces the former.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: The *Héshàng* text reads, *“dwell in substance, not in superficiality; rest in reality, not in adornment.”* **Wáng Bì** concurs. **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Héshàng* manuscripts vary—some render both latter clauses with *“reside”* (居), while the *Shitōchō*, *Fù*, and *Fàn* versions use *“dwell”* (处) in all four clauses. **Sūn Shèng’s** *Old and New Doubts on Laozi* also follows this pattern. **Fàn Yìngyuán** states: *“Hán Fēi* and *Yán Zhūn* align with the ancient text, though one variant renders the latter clauses with *“reside”* (居).* **Bì Yàn** remarks: *Wáng Fú’s* *Hidden Talents* reads *“not reside in superficiality,”* matching *Wáng Bì’s* version. **Zhū Mù’s** *Exalting Thickness* cites the first two clauses with *“dwell”* (处) and the latter two with *“reside”* (居).\n\nFurthermore, *“therefore, he rejects the latter and embraces the former”*—**Yán Zhūn’s** text omits *“therefore”* (故). The *Huáinán* *Dàoyìng* commentary cites this sentence identically.\n\n---\n**[Phonology & Rhyme]**\nThis chapter lacks rhyme in *Jiāng Shì’s* readings. **Xí Dòng** notes: *“Chief/beginning”* (首/始) and *“thin/adornment”* (薄/华) form rhymes. **Lǐ Qióngyún** confirms: *“Thin”* (薄) and *“adornment”* (华) rhyme, as do *“chief”* (首) and *“beginning”* (始). In ancient pronunciation, *“adornment”* (华) was pronounced like *“spread”* (敷). The *Gōngyáng* *Āi* *Sìnián* records *“Púshè zāi”* (蒲社灾), while *Gǔliáng* and *Zuǒshì* render it *“Bìshè”* (亳社). The *Lǐjì* *Jiāotèshēng* *“Bóshè běi yǒu”* (薄社北牖) has the *Shìwén* annotation: *“Also written as ‘Bì’ (亳).”* This confirms *“Pú”* (蒲) as an alternate for *“Bì”* (亳). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** states: *“Thin”* (薄) and *“adornment”* (华) form a rhyme. *“Adornment”* (华) in ancient pronunciation was akin to *“lín”* (荂), belonging to the *Yú* (鱼) and *Yú* (虞) phonetic groups. *“Thin”* (薄), derived from *“pǔ”* (溥), thus belongs to the *Yú* (鱼) and *Yú* (虞) entering tones.\n\n---\nThe *Jìnglóng* stele contains **129 characters** (consistent in *Dūnhuáng*, *Hé*, and *Wáng* manuscripts), while the *Fù* version has **131** and the *Fàn* version **133**. The *Héshàng* heading reads *“Chapter 38: On Virtue”* (论德第三十八), the *Wáng* version *“Chapter 38”* (三十八章), and the *Fàn* version *“Chapter 38: On the Supreme Virtue Not Being Virtue”* (上德不德章第三十八).\n\n---\n**Chapter 39: Those of old who attained the One**\nHeaven, having attained the One, became clear;\nEarth, having attained the One, became tranquil;\nThe *Spirit* (*shén*), having attained the One, became responsive;\nThe valleys, having attained the One, became full;\nAll things, having attained the One, came to life;\n**Qiān Zhī** notes: The character *“宁”* (ning) in the *Jìfú* stele was altered to *“宁”* (also ning) to avoid the Qing emperor’s taboo; here, it is restored to the original *“宁”* (as in tranquility), consistent with the stele’s text below.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** states: *“All things”* (万物) is the standard reading. **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The *Dūnhuáng* *Wù* manuscript omits this sentence. **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Jìngfú* and *Fàn* versions also render *“万”* (wàn) as *“万”* (wàn). Additionally, **Chén Bìxū** asserts: *“Yán Jūnping’s* text lacks *“All things, having attained the One, came to life”* (万物得一以生) and the following *“All things, without the One, would perish”* (万物无以生将恐灭), totaling **14 characters** omitted.\n\nThe sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, **established rectitude for the world** (*wéi tiānxià zhèng*).\n**Yán Kějūn** notes: The *Yùzhù* and *Wáng Bì* versions render *“下贞”* (xiàzhēn, “below as the true”). **Fàn Yìngyuán** explains: *“Zhēn”* (贞) means *“zhèng”* (正, rectitude). *Wáng Bì* and *Guō* follow the ancient text, though one variant renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正), likely due to taboo avoidance. The *Héshàng* version reads *“sovereigns and lords”* (侯王). **Qiān Zhī** observes: The *Fù*, *Fàn*, and *Nài* manuscripts, as well as *Qúnshū Zhìyào*, **Sūn Shèng’s** *Old and New Doubts on Laozi*, the *Jìnshū* *Kǎi’ài* biography, and *Shūcháo* **149** all render it *“zhēn”* (贞). **Yán Zhūn**, *Héshàng*, *Gùhuān*, *Jìngfú*, *Lóuzhèng*, *Qìngyáng*, *Pányuān*, *Shitōchō*, and *Yùpiàn* under the *“一”* (yī) radical all cite *“zhèng”* (正), while the *Zhuōzhōu* version renders it *“zhèng”* (政). The *Zhōngdū Sìzǐ* manuscript reads *“with the world as rectitude”* (以天下为正). **Wáng Niánsūn** argues: The *Héshàng* version renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正), with the annotation *“to make the world orderly.”* **Niánsūn** further notes: The *Ěryá* states *“zhèng”* (正) means *“long”* (长). The *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* *“Jūnshǒu”* (君守) passage *“can establish rectitude for the world”* (可以为天下正), with **Gāo Yáng’s** annotation *“zhèng”* (正) meaning *“master”* (主). *“To establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下正) is akin to the *Hóngfàn* statement *“to be master over the world”* (为天下主). The subsequent lines *“Heaven, without the One, would not be clear”* (天无以清) and *“Earth, without the One, would not be tranquil”* (地无以宁) echo the earlier *“Heaven, having attained the One, became clear”* (天得一以清) and *“Earth, having attained the One, became tranquil”* (地得一以宁). Further, *“sovereigns and lords, without the One, would not be noble and exalted”* (侯王无以贵高) directly follows *“to establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下正), proving *“zhèng”* (正) carries the meaning *“sovereign/master,”* not *“orderly.”* **Wáng Bì’s** version renders *“zhēn”* (贞), a borrowed character. **Dōngtiáo Yītáng** notes: *“To establish rectitude for the world”* (为天下贞) has a variant *“zhèng”* (正), conflicting with the annotation. The same applies below. The *Zhèngguān Zhèngyào* *“Xíngfǎ”* (刑法) **31** also renders it *“zhèng”* (正). **Péng Zhì** states: All manuscripts render *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正) to avoid taboo. **Yì Shùndǐng** notes: *“Zhēn”* (贞) and *“zhèng”* (正) were interchangeable in ancient usage. **Wángshì Shūshū Zházhì** claims *“zhēn”* (贞) is a borrowed character, though this is not entirely accurate. The *Yì* *“Zhēn shèng zhě yě”* (贞胜者也) cites Laozi: *“The sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, established rectitude for the world”* (王侯得一以为天下贞). **Wáng Bì’s** *Zhōuyì Lièlì* states: *“What governs all movement under Heaven is the One, established as true.”* **Xíng Yǐng’s** annotation on Laozi also renders it *“zhēn”* (贞). The *Wénxuǎn* *“Wáng Yuáncháng’s** *Qúshuǐ Shī Xù*” annotation likewise cites *“zhēn”* (贞). Thus, *“zhēn”* (贞) is the original character. **Láo Jiàn** notes: *“The sovereigns and lords, having attained the One, established rectitude for the world”* (侯王得一以为天下贞) renders *“zhēn”* (贞) as *“zhèng”* (正) in the *Jìnglóng* and *Jìngfú* versions, while the *Kāiyuán*, *Fù*, *Fàn*, and *Zhūwáng* manuscripts retain *“zhēn”* (贞).",

      "translated_text": "「Fàn Zhù’s annotation states: *“Zhēn (贞) is zhèng (正). One version originally had zhèng (正), but later scholars altered it to avoid taboo.”* According to the **Dàozàng** *Yùzhù* and *Yùshū* editions, the original text was *“zhèng”* (正), with the *shū* (疏) remarking: *“The original may have been written as ‘zhēn’ (贞), but zhēn (贞) is indeed zhèng (正).”* The **Kāiyuán** stone carving, however, later changed to *“zhēn”* (贞), and Fàn’s claim that *“later scholars altered it to avoid taboo”* is incorrect.\n\nAgain, in this chapter, whenever *“hóuwáng”* (侯王) appears, **Fù Yì** and **Fàn Zhù** render it as *“wáng hóu”* (王侯), which is incorrect. All **Táng** editions, **Róshàng Gōng**’s version, and the **Héshàng** edition retain *“hóuwáng”* (侯王), harmonizing with *“zhēn”* (贞) in the parallel rhyme structure of the passage. **Qiān Zhī** confirms: *“Zhēn (贞) is correct.”*\n\nThe *Yì Jìxù* states: *“All movement under Heaven is governed by establishing the One.”* It further says: *“This is to speak of attaining the One.”* In this passage of **Láozi**, *“hóuwáng dé yī wéi tiānxià zhēn”* (侯王得一以为天下贞), **Fù Yì**, **Fàn Zhù**, and the **Shìwén** annotation all include *“qí zhì zhī yī yě”* (其致之一也), aligning perfectly with the *Yì*’s meaning.\n\nMoreover, the **Luó** manuscripts and the **Osaka Túshūguǎn**’s old transcribed copy both read *“tiānxià zhēn”* (天下贞). **Shòuyě Zhíxǐ** notes: *“Even **Róshàng Gōng**’s version originally had ‘zhēn’ (贞), but the **Sòng** editions altered ‘zhēn’ (贞) to ‘zhèng’ (正) to avoid taboo against the word ‘empire.’”* Now, verified by the **Jǐnglóng** stele text, we know *“zhēn”* (贞) and *“zhèng”* (正) were interchangeably used in antiquity, and the taboo-avoidance theory is also incorrect.\n\n**Qiān Zhī** notes: The stele text and **Luó**’s version both read *“wú”* (无), not *“wú”* (无) with a dot, as a variant case.\n\n**Wǔnèi Fǎjīng**’s *Dūnyǐ* edition renders it as *“wú”* (无) with a dot. Additionally, in **Zhuāngzi**’s *Zhìlè* chapter: *“The **Tian** (天) does not act yet attains clarity, the **Dì** (地) does not act yet attains tranquility.”* The meaning originates here.\n\n**Liú Shīpèi** states: *“Fā (发) should be read as ‘fèi’ (废).”* The *Shuōwén* explains: *“Fèi (废), a house collapsing. One meaning: ‘fèi’ (废) as exhaustion.”* **Huáinánzǐ**’s *Lànmíng Xùn* uses *“sìjí fèi”* (四极废), with **Gāo Zhù** annotating: *“Fèi (废), exhaustion.”* The *Zhuǎnzǐng*’s *Dìng Sānnián* (定三年) uses *“fèi yú lú tàn”* (废于炉炭), with **Dù Zhù** explaining: *“Fèi (废), to fall.”* The meaning of exhaustion aligns with *“qīnghuī”* (倾圮). *“Jiāng tè fèi” (将恐发) is akin to saying *“jiāng tè bēnghuī”* (将崩圮), meaning the earth would collapse. *“Fā” (发) is the abbreviated form of *“fèi” (废).* **Jiǎng Xīchāng** agrees with **Liú Shīpèi**’s view. In **Zhuāngzi**’s *Lièyǔkòu* (列御寇), the annotation reads: *“Fā (发), Sīmǎ (司马) renders as ‘fèi’ (废).”* **Lièzǐ**’s *Huángdì* (黄帝) chapter cites it as *“fèi” (废).* The **Shìxìng** (缮性) text states: *“Not concealing one’s wisdom without letting it manifest”* (非藏其智而不发也), and the **Yùguǎn** (御览) *Yìmín* (逸民) section cites it as *“fèi” (废).* The *Zhuǎnzǐng*’s *Āi Shíyīnián* (哀十一年) annotation, quoting *Zhúshū Jìnián* (竹书纪年), states: *“Liáng Huìwáng fèi fèngjì zhī suǒ yǐ cì mín”* (梁惠王废逢忌之薮以赐民), while the **Hànshū** *Dìlǐ Zhì* (地理志) cites it as *“fā” (发).* These serve as further evidence. *“Fā” (发) and *“fèi” (废)* share the same initial consonant, hence their interchangeability.\n\nThis passage states: *“If the **Tian** (天) lacks clarity, it will fear collapse; if the **Dì** (地) lacks tranquility, it will fear exhaustion.”*\n\n*“If the **Shén** (神) lacks vitality, it will fear cessation; if the **Gǔ** (谷) lacks fullness, it will fear depletion.”* **Bì Qián** remarks: *“Jié” (竭), **Róshàng Gōng** and **Wáng Bì** both render as *“xiē”* (歇), but it should be *“jié”* (竭).* **Qiān Zhī** confirms: *“**Róshàng Gōng** and **Wáng Bì** both render *“jié”* (竭), but the preceding sentence reads *“xiē”* (歇), indicating **Bì Qián**’s correction is erroneous.*\n\nThe *Shuōwén* defines *“xiē”* (歇) as *“rest” or “exhaustion of breath.”* **Guǎngyǎ**’s *Shìgǔ* (释诂) II explains: *“Xiē (歇), exhaustion.”* In the *Qīfā* (七发): *“When vital breath is exhausted, all diseases arise.”* *“Jié” (竭)* is borrowed as *“kě”* (渴), meaning *“exhaustion” (from water), with the sound ‘màn’ (曼).”* The *Ēryǎ* (尔雅) *Shìgǔ* (释诂) states: *“Gù (涸), exhaustion.”* Classical texts often use *“jié”* (竭) for this meaning, indicating *“jié”* (竭) carries the sense of *“gù”* (涸) and *“jìn”* (尽). The *Zhōuyǔ* (周语) *“Yī, Luò jié ér Xià wáng”* (伊、洛竭而夏亡) is annotated as *“gù”* (涸). The **Huáinánzǐ** *Shuōlín* (说林) states: *“Deep springs cannot be exhausted.”* The **Běnjīng** (本经) says: *“Exhaust the marsh and fish.”* **Róshàng Gōng**’s annotation here reads: *“The **Gǔ** (谷) should have periods of fullness and emptiness, but if one only desires it to be perpetually full without limit, it will fear drying up and ceasing to be a marsh.”* *“Jié” (竭)* shares the same meaning as *“kě”* (渴), requiring no alteration.\n\n*“If all things lack the means to flourish, they will fear annihilation.”* **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The **Dūnhuáng** edition omits this sentence.\n\n*“If the **Hóuwáng** (侯王) lack the means to attain noble virtue, they will fear downfall.”* **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** observes: The **Jǐng** (景), **Suì** (遂), and **Dūn** (敦) three editions render *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王) consistently with the preceding text, and the latter part also aligns. The **Jǐng** (景) and **Suì** (遂) editions both have *“guì gāo”* (贵高), while the **Dūn** (敦) edition omits *“gāo”* (高); yet, the latter part refers to *“guì gāo”* (贵高) together, so *“gāo”* (高) should be retained. **Luó Zhènyù** notes: The **Dūnhuáng** edition has *“zhēn”* (贞) followed by *“ér”* (而). **Qiān Zhī** suggests: *“This sentence likely contains textual errors.”*\n\nAll **Héshàng** (河上), **Wáng** (王) editions, **Gùhuān** (顾欢) edition, **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Shìtóng** (室町), **Luó** (罗) manuscripts, and **Nǐjuàn** (柰卷) versions follow this reading. **Fàn Zhù**’s edition reads: *“Wáng hóu wú yǐ wéi zhēn, jiāng tè xī”* (王侯无以为贞，将恐溪). **Gāo Yì** (高翿) renders: *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn ér guì gāo, jiāng tè jué”* (侯王无以贞而贵高，将恐蹶). **Fù Yì** (傅奕) reads: *“Wáng hóu wú yǐ wéi zhēn ér guì gāo, jiāng tè xī”* (王侯无以为贞而贵高，将恐溪). **Péng Zhì** (彭耜) and **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯) agree with **Fù Yì**’s edition, except *“Wáng hóu”* (王侯) is rendered as *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王). **Yán Zūn** (严遵) follows **Péng Zhì**’s version, but *“wú yǐ wéi zhēn”* (无以为贞) is rendered as *“wú yǐ wéi zhèng”* (无以为正).

      "translated_text": "「Guì」 and 「zhēn」 share similar forms; later scholars, noting the passage in Wang Bi’s commentary—*\"qīng bùzú guì\"* (清不足贵)—altered 「zhēn」 to 「guì». Suspecting that 「guì gāo」 (贵高) was a redundant phrase, they further added 「gāo」 (高) beneath 「guì」 (贵) to align with the subsequent 「guì gāo」 (贵高). Yet in truth, 「guì」 (贵) should read as 「zhēn」 (贞), while 「gāo」 (高) is a superfluous insertion.\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) argues: It should read *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn, jiāng kǒng jué”* (侯王无以贞，将恐蹶), with 「zhēn」 (贞) mistakenly taken as 「guì」 (贵). Later scholars, seeing the following lines *“guì yǐ jiàn wéi běn, gāo yǐ xià wéi jī”* (贵以贱为本，高以下为基), assumed they followed the preceding text and arbitrarily added 「gāo」 (高) beneath 「guì」 (贵), thereby perpetuating the error and rendering the meaning incoherent.\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes: *“Jiāng kǒng xī”* (将恐溪) is rendered as *“jiāng kǒng jué”* (将恐蹶) in the **Zhūwáng** (诸王) edition. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *“jué”* (蹶) as *“jiāng”* (僵, stiff), from the foot radical with the phonetic *guì* (厥). It also states: *“One reading: tiào”* (跳, leap), also pronounced as *“xī”* (溪). The *Guǎngyùn* (广韵) defines *“jué”* (蹶) as *“shī jiǎo”* (失脚, stumble) or *“jiāng”* (僵, stiff), also written as *“xī”* (溪). The *Guǎngyá Shìgǔ* (广雅释诂) explains *“xī”* (溪) as *“bài”* (败, ruin). In *Lǚshì* (吕览) *Shènháng* (慎行), *“xiǎorén zhī xíng, bù xī yú shān”* (小人之行，不溪于山), the commentary reads: *“Xī”* (溪) means *“tīng zhì diān dùn”* (踬踬颠顿, stumbling and falling). In *Xúnzǐ* (荀子) *Chéngxiàng* (成相), *“guó nǎi xī”* (国乃溪), the commentary states: *“Diānfù”* (颠覆, overturn). Thus *“Hóuwáng wú yǐ zhēn, jiāng kǒng xī”* (侯王无以贞，将恐溪) means: *“If lords and kings lack integrity (zhēn), they risk ruin and losing their position.”* The *Húnán Dàoshàng Xuányì* (淮南道应训) and *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要) both cite *“xī”* (溪), while *Xià Jùn* (夏竦) in *Gǔwén Sìshēngyùn* (古文四声韵) and *Gǔ Lǎozǐ* (古老子) also use *“xī”* (溪).\n\nHence, *“guì yǐ jiàn wéi běn, gāo yǐ xià wéi jī”* (贵以贱为本，高以下为基). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes that the imperial commentary omits the *“wéi”* (为) beneath *“gāo”* (高), while the **Héshàng** (河上) version includes *“bì”* (必) beneath *“gāo”* (高). **Yǔ Huì** (宇惠) observes that in *Qíshì* (齐策), *“guì yǐ”* (贵以) and *“gāo yǐ”* (高以) are both preceded by *“suī”* (虽). **Qián Zhī** (谦之) further notes that in editions like *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Shìtōng* (室町), *Nǎijuǎn* (柰卷), *Gùhuān* (顾欢), as well as in *Húnán Dàoshàng Xuányì* (淮南道应训) and *Qúnshū Zhìyào* (群书治要), the *“yǐ”* (以) is preceded by *“bì”* (必). The *Húnán Yuándào Xuàn* (淮南原道训) states: *“Shìgù guìzhě bì yǐ jiàn wéi hào, ér gāozhě bì yǐ xià wéi jī”* (是故贵者必以贱为号，而高者必以下为基), which aligns with this passage.\n\nThus, *“Hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes that **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders *“bù gǔ”* (不毂) as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷). The **Héshàng** (河上) commentary explains: *“Bù gǔ”* (不毂) signifies *“bù néng rú chē gǔ wéi zhòng fú suǒ còu”* (不能如车毂为众辐所凑, unable to serve as the hub for all spokes). The same term appears in Chapter 42. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes that *“Hóuwáng”* (侯王) is rendered as *“Wánghóu”* (王侯) in the **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) editions, while the *Wénxuàn Xuěfù* (文选雪赋) annotation cites it as *“Wánggōng”* (王公). The term *“zì wèi”* (自谓) is rendered as *“wèi”* (谓) in the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition, and as *“chēng”* (称) in the **Péng Zhì** (彭耜), **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元), **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯), *Shìtōng* (室町), *Nǎijuǎn* (柰卷), and *Zhìyào* (治要) versions. **Yì Shùndǐng** (易顺鼎) argues that *“zì wèi”* (自谓) should read *“zì chēng”* (自称). In Chapter 42, it states: *“Rén zhī suǒ wù, wéi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, ér wánggōng wéi chēng”* (人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不谷，而王公以为称). Thus, this passage must also read *“chēng”* (称). The *Húnán Gāo Zhù* (淮南高注) correctly uses *“chēng”* (称), and the *Wénxuàn Qiū Xīfàn yǔ Chén Bózī shū* (文选邱希范与陈伯之书) annotation cites it as *“Wánghóu zì chēng gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (王侯自称孤、寡、不谷), serving as further evidence.\n\n**Hóng Yìxuǎn** (洪颐烜) notes: In the *Déjīng* (德经), *“Shìyǐ hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (是以侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂), while the *Lǐjì Qūlǐ* (礼记曲礼) states *“Yú nèi zì chēng yuē bù gǔ”* (于内自称曰不谷), with **Zhèng Xùn** (郑玄) commenting: *“Gǔ”* (谷), meaning *“shàn”* (善, good). In the *Zuǒshī Lìsìnián Zhuan* (左氏僖四年传), *“Qǐ bù gǔ shì wéi”* (岂不谷是为), **Dù Yǔ** (杜预) annotates: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, zhūhóu qiáncí”* (孤、寡、不毂，诸侯谦辞). The character is consistently written as *“gǔ”* (谷). In *Lièzǐ Tiānrú Piān* (列子天瑞篇), *“yuān zhī wéi bù gǔ”* (鹯之为布毂), the *Shìwén* (释文) states: *“Gǔ”* (毂) is also written as *“gǔ”* (谷). **Héshàng** (河上) mistakenly reads *“gǔ”* (毂) as *“chē gǔ”* (车毂, wheel hub).\n\n**Xú Dǐ** (徐鼒) argues: According to the *Lǎozǐ Fǎ* (老子法), in this chapter *“Shìyǐ hóuwáng zì wèi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (是以侯王自谓孤、寡、不毂), the **Héshàng Zhāngjù** (河上章句) states: *“Bù gǔ”* (不毂) *“yù shì bù néng rú chē gǔ wéi zhòng fú suǒ còu”* (喻不能如车毂为众辐所凑). In the *“Dàohuà”* (道化) chapter, *“Rén zhī suǒ wù, wéi gū, guǎ, bù gǔ, ér wánggōng wéi chēng”* (人之所恶，唯孤、寡、不毂，而王公以为称), the commentary states: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (孤、寡、不毂) *“bù xiáng zhī míng”* (不祥之名). **Dǐ** (鼒) asserts that the *“bù xiáng”* (不祥) interpretation is correct, while *“bù néng rú chē gǔ”* (不能如车毂) is a case of *“wàng wén shēngyì”* (望文生义, taking words at face value without ancient context). *“Gǔ”* (毂) and *“gǔ”* (谷) are interchangeable. In the *“Shī Zhēngyuè”* (诗正月), *“sùsù fāng yǒu gǔ”* (蔌蔌方有谷), the *Hòuhàn Cáiyōng Zhuan* (后汉书蔡邕传) renders it as *“sùsù fāng gǔ”* (速速方毂). In *Lièzǐ Tiānrú Piān* (列子天瑞篇), *“yuān zhī wéi bù gǔ”* (鹯之为布毂), the *Shìwén* (释文) states: *“Gǔ”* (毂) is also written as *“gǔ”* (谷). In *Lǚshì Guāntiáo Piān* (吕览观表篇), *“Wèi yòu zǎi gǔ chén”* (卫右宰谷臣), the *Wénxuàn Liú Xiàobié Guójue Liúlùn Zhù* (文选刘孝标广绝交论注) renders it as *“gǔ chén”* (毂臣). These are phonetically similar borrowed characters.\n\nThe term *“gǔ”* (毂) means *“shàn”* (善, good), as annotated by **Zhèng Xùn** (郑玄) in the *Qūlǐ* (曲礼), referring to one’s own unworthiness in a humble phrase. *“Gǔ”* (谷) also means *“lù”* (禄, blessing), as annotated by **Gāo Gòu** (高诱) in the *Húnán Rénjiān Xuàn* (淮南人间训), akin to *“bù lù”* (不禄, unblessed), also a humble phrase. **Wáng Bì**’s (王弼) edition also uses *“gǔ”* (谷). **Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (孤、寡、不谷) are indeed humble terms. In *Lǚshì Jūnshǒu Piān* (吕览君守篇), *“jūn míng gū, guǎ, ér bù kě zhàngyōng”* (君名孤、寡，而不可障壅), **Gāo Gòu** (高诱) annotates: *“Gū, guǎ”* (孤、寡) *“rénjūn zhī qiāncí”* (人君之谦辞). The stele inscription renders *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) as *“bù gǔ”* (不毂), where *“gǔ”* (毂) is a borrowed character for *“gǔ”* (谷).",

      "translated_text": "The *Hou Han Shu* biography of **Cài Yōng** (后汉书蔡邕传) reads *“sùsù fāng gǔ”* (速速方毂), with the annotation: *“Gǔ”* (毂) means *“lù”* (禄). Since *“gǔ”* (谷) also means *“lù”* (禄), it is clear that *“bù gǔ”* (不毂) is the same as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷). Though *“gǔ”* (谷) is glossed as *“lù”* (禄), *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) does not carry the exact meaning of *“bù lù”* (unblessed). This is a regional dialect, akin to *“pú”* (仆, servant).\n\n**Zhāng Bǐnglín** (章炳麟) states:\n*“Zì chēng yuē pú”* (自称曰仆), originally meaning *“chénpú”* (臣仆, subject-servant), also carries the connotation of *“duǎn”* (short, humble). When nobles refer to themselves as *“bù gǔ”* (不谷), *“bù gǔ”* (不谷) is a phonetic fusion of *“pú”* (仆). The *Húnán Rénjiān Xuàn* (淮南人间训) annotation reads: *“Bù gǔ, bù lù yě”* (不谷，不禄也), but this is an instance of *“wàng wén shēng xuàn”* (望文生训, etymological fallacy). The ancients would not have used *“bù lù”* (unblessed) to refer to themselves in death. Further discussion is found in *Xīn Fāngyán* (新方言).\n\nIs this then treating *“jiàn”* (贱, lowliness) as the foundation? **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) says: *“Fēi”* (非), with the original manuscripts reading *“fēi hū”* (非乎).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nThe phrase *“cǐ qí”* (此其) appears in the imperial annotations, **Xíng Xuàn** (邢玄), **Qìngyáng** (庆阳), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Péng Zī** (彭耜), **Gāo Yì** (高翿), and **Zhào Méngfǔ** (赵孟俯), all matching this inscription. **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) read *“shì qí”* (是其), while **Yán Zūn** (严遵) reads *“wéi sī”* (唯斯). The **Zhūhé** (诸河) and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts read *“cǐ fēi”* (此非). **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元) states:\n*“Wáng Bì”* (王弼) aligns with the ancient manuscripts, while **Héshànggōng** (河上公) reads *“cǐ fēi yǐ jiàn wéi běn yē, fēi hū”* (此非以贱为本邪，非乎). The current text follows the ancient manuscripts. Thus, **Fàn** (范) saw the **Wáng** (王) manuscript with *“fēi”* (非) as *“qí”* (其).\n\nThe character *“yē”* (耶), in the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) and **Yán Zūn** (严遵) manuscripts, is *“yǔ”* (与). **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Fù** (傅), and **Fàn** (范) read *“yě”* (也). The **Suìzhōu** (遂州) manuscript matches this inscription. **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes:\n*“Fēi”* (非) is written *“fēi yú”* (非欤) by **Fàn** (范), *“bēi hū”* (悲乎) by **Jǐngfú** (景福), and *“fēi yě”* (非也) in the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) manuscript. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Zuò qí”* (作其) is correct. This passage employs Chu dialect. **Jiǎng Xīchāng** (蒋锡昌) states:\nIn the *Shǐjì* (史记) *Gāozǔ Jì* (高祖纪), *“qí yǐ pèi wéi nǐ tāngmù yì”* (其以沛为朕汤沐邑), the *Jíjiě* (集解) cites *Fēngsú Tōng* (风俗通): *“Qí”* (其) is a Chu word. Since **Lǎozǐ** (老子) was from Chu, he should use Chu dialect. In Chapter 58, *“qí wú zhèng”* (其无正) is equivalent to *“wú zhèng”* (无正). In Chapter 77, *“qí bù yù jiàn xián”* (其不欲见贤) is equivalent to *“bù yù jiàn xián”* (不欲见贤). *“Shì qí yǐ jiàn wéi běn yě, fēi yú”* (是其以贱为本也，非欤) is equivalent to *“shì yǐ jiàn wéi běn yě fēi yú”* (是以贱为本也非欤).\n\nThus, *“gù zhì shù chē wú chē”* (故致数车无车). **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes:\nThe imperial annotations and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) read *“shù yú wú yú”* (数舆无舆), while **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) in the upper text writes *“yú”* (舆) as *“yǔ”* (与), an error. **Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nThe two *“chē”* (车) characters appear in **Héshànggōng** (河上公), **Gù Huān** (顾欢), **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Shìmíng** (室町), and **Nǎijuǎn** (柰卷) manuscripts, matching this inscription. **Yán Zūn** (严遵) and **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) read *“yú”* (舆). **Yán** (严) writes *“zhì shù yú”* (致数舆) as *“zào yú yú”* (造舆于), with the **Dūn** (敦) manuscript ending the sentence with *“yě”* (也). The **Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ** (法京敦乙) manuscript writes the first *“chē”* (车) as *“yǔ”* (与) and the second as *“yù”* (誉), matching **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) and the imperial annotations. The **Suìzhōu** (遂州), **Fù** (傅), and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts read *“yù”* (誉) for both. **Fàn Yìngyuán** (范应元) states:\n*“Wáng Bì”* (王弼) aligns with the ancient manuscripts, while **Héshànggōng** (河上公) reads *“shù chē wú chē”* (数车无车). The current text follows the various **Wáng** (王) manuscripts reading *“yú”* (舆), while the **Dàozàng Wáng** (道藏王) manuscript and the **Dàozàng Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu** (道藏宋张太守) collated *Sìjiā Zhù* (四家注) also cite **Wáng Bì** (王弼) as *“gù zhì shù yù, nǎi wú yù yě”* (故致数誉，乃无誉也).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Zuò yù”* (作誉) is correct. The two *“chē”* (车) or *“yú”* (舆) are both errors for *“yù”* (誉), as *“yù”* (誉) and *“yǔ”* (与) were interchangeable in ancient script. *“Yù”* (誉) was mistakenly written as *“yú”* (舆) or *“chē”* (车). **Sū Língzhī** (苏灵芝) and the **Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ** (法京敦乙) manuscripts are evidence of this.\n\nThe interpretation of *“shù chē wú chē”* (数车无车) varies. **Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) states:\n*“Zhūjiā jiě bù tōng”* (诸家解不通), and I say: *“Shù chē zhī gè jiàn, wú yī míng chē zhě”* (数车之各件，无一名车者), metaphorically meaning *“wǒ shì yī shēn, wú yī míng wǒ yě”* (我是一身，无一名我也). **Chéng Xuányīng** (成玄英) says:\n*“Yú”* (舆, vehicle) is *“chē”* (车), composed of *“xiāng”* (箱), *“fú”* (辐), *“gǔ”* (毂), and *“lèi”* (辋). Though named *“chē”* (车), in number it lacks substance. The five elements and four great directions are illusory—just as the body floats in emptiness, where shall nobility reside?\n\n**Lǐ Zhì** (李贽) says:\n*“Jīn fú lún, fú, gài, zhěn, héng, è, gǔ, xián\"* (今夫轮、辐、盖、轸、衡、轭、毂、), when combined, form *“chē”* (车). Yet people see only these parts—when have they seen *“chē”* (车) itself? Yet it is called *“chē”* (车), not *“lún, fú, gài, zhěn, héng, è, gǔ, xián”* (轮、辐、盖、轸、衡、轭、毂、).\n\n**Qián Zhī** (谦之) notes:\nBoth **Lǐ** (李) interpretations reflect Buddhist teachings, as evidenced by the extant Pali *Mìlán Wáng Wèn Jīng* (弥兰王问经) and the lost *Nàxiān Bīqiú Jīng* (那先比丘经) from the Eastern Jin dynasty. The text reads:\n\n*“Nàxiān wèn Wáng: ‘Yán míng chē, hé suǒ wéi chē zhě? Zhóu wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Zhóu bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Lèi wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Lèi bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Fú wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Fú bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Gǔ wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Gǔ bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Yún wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Yún bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Káng wéi chē yě?’*\n*Wáng yuē: ‘Káng bù wéi chē.’*\n*Nàxiān yuē: ‘Gài wéi chē yě?’*",
      "overlap_context": "án Rénjiān Xuàn* (淮南人间训), akin to *“bù lù”* (不禄, unblessed), also a humble phrase. **Wáng Bì**’s (王弼) edition also uses *“gǔ”* (谷). **Qián Zhī** (谦之) concludes: *“Gū, guǎ, bù gǔ”* (孤、寡、不谷) are indeed humble terms. In *Lǚshì Jūnshǒu Piān* (吕览君守篇), *“jūn míng gū, guǎ, ér bù kě zhàngyōng”* (君名孤、寡，而不可障壅), **Gāo Gòu** (高诱) annotates: *“Gū, guǎ”* (孤、寡) *“rénjūn zhī qiāncí”* (人君之谦辞).

      "translated_text": "Since the teachings of the Buddha entered China, there arose the saying of *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\").\n\nThe terms *\"zuò chē\"* (作车, \"to make a chariot\") and *\"zuò yù\"* (作舆, \"to make a carriage\") may share some meaning, yet they are not the original words of *Laozi*—this is quite evident.\n\nGao Yandi said: *\"Zhi yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\"). The *He Shang* (河上) version reads *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数舆无舆), while Wang Bi’s (王弼) and *Huainanzi Dao Ying* (淮南子道应训) versions read *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数舆无舆), all of which are strained interpretations that do not align with the original text.\n\nThe *Lu Shi* (陆氏) annotation explains the character *\"yù\"* (誉) as *\"huì yù\"* (毁誉, \"praise and blame\"). Thus, the original text should have been *\"yù\"* (誉).\n\nFrom *\"yù\"* (誉) it was corrupted to *\"yù\"* (舆, \"carriage\"), and from *\"yù\"* (舆) to *\"chē\"* (车, \"chariot\"). Later scholars mistakenly believed the annotation was incorrect, but this is not the case.\n\nIn the *Zhuangzi* chapter *\"Zhi Le\"* (至乐, \"Utmost Joy\"), it states *\"Zhi yù wú yù\"* (至誉无誉, \"extreme praise without praise\"), followed by *\"Tian wú wéi yǐ zhī qīng, dì wú wéi yǐ zhī níng\"* (天无为以之清，地无为以之宁, \"Heaven acts without action and thus is clear; Earth acts without action and thus is tranquil\"). This clearly draws from the same passage, further confirming the original reading.\n\nLuo Yunxian said: *\"Yù\"* (誉) means *\"huì yù\"* (毁誉, \"praise and blame\"). Wu Cheng’s (吴澄) version reads *\"yù\"* (舆) instead of *\"yù\"* (誉), and Jiao Shi’s (焦氏) *Kao Yi* (考异) notes that *\"yù\"* (舆) was originally *\"yù\"* (誉). It is evident that *\"yù\"* (誉) is the correct character for meaning.\n\nI suspect the original text was *\"zhi shu yǔ wú yǔ\"* (致数与无与, \"extreme calculation of giving without giving\"), as *\"yù\"* (誉) and *\"yǔ\"* (与) were used interchangeably in ancient times (as in the *Zuo* commentary: *\"yù\"* or *\"yǔ\"*).\n\n*\"Shu\"* (数) means *\"counting\"* or *\"calculating\"*—so *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数誉无誉) means *\"extreme calculation of praise without praise\"*.\n\nThe *Houwang* (侯王, \"feudal lords and kings\") call themselves *\"gū\"* (孤, \"lonely\"), *\"guǎ\"* (寡, \"few\"), and *\"bù gǔ\"* (不谷, \"not abundant\"), which is *\"not calculating praise\"*, yet praise is still attributed to them. Thus, *\"zhi shu yù wú yù\"* (致数誉无誉) is clearly understood.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* passage *\"Saying on Mountains\"* (说山训) states: *\"Qiú měi zé bù dé měi, bù qiú měi zé měi yǐ\"* (求美则不得美，不求美则美矣, \"If one seeks beauty, one does not attain beauty; if one does not seek beauty, beauty is attained\"). The annotation reads: *\"Xīn zì qiú měi zé bù dé měi míng yě, ér zì sǔn zé yǒu měi míng yě, gù Lǎozi yuē 'zhi shu yù wú yù'*\"* (心自求美则不得美名也，而自损则有美名也，故老子曰『致数舆无舆』也。), though the text reads *\"yù\"* (舆), the explanation is about *\"měi míng\"* (美名, \"good reputation\"), confirming that it should be read as *\"yù\"* (誉).\n\nThis interpretation is quite insightful.\n\n*\"Bù yù liáng liáng rú yù, luò luò rú shí\"* (不欲琭琭如玉，落落如石, \"One does not desire the lustrous like jade, nor the firm like stone\").\n\nYan Kejun said: *\"Luò luò\"* (落落) was rendered as *\"luò luò\"* (珞珞) in Wang Bi’s version.\n\nLuo Zhentian noted that the *Dunhuang* (敦煌) version reads *\"lù lù\"* (禄禄) or *\"luò luò\"* (落落).\n\nIn my examination: *\"Liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) was written as *\"lù lù\"* (碌碌) in *Jingfu* (景福) version, and *\"luò luò\"* (落落) as *\"shí\"* (石, \"stone\") in *Yu zhu* (御注), *Sui zhou* (遂州), *Qing Xuan* (邢玄), *Qingyang* (庆阳), *Pan Xi* (磻溪), *Lou Zheng* (楼正), *Shiming* (室町), *Nan juan* (柰卷), *Yan Zun* (严遵), *He Shang* (河上), *Gu Huan* (顾欢), *Peng* (彭), *Fan* (范), and *Zhao* (赵) versions, while *Jingfu* (景福) rendered it as *\"guò guò\"* (硌硌). Fu Yi (傅奕) and Fan (范) versions also read *\"ruò\"* (若) for both *\"rú\"* (如) characters.\n\nBi Qian said: *\"In ancient texts, there were no characters 'liáng' (琭), 'lù' (碌), or 'luò' (珞). 'Guò' (硌) should be corrected to 'luò' (落).\"*\n\nThe *Guangyun* (广韵) states: *\"Gōng děng lù lù\"* (公等录录) as *\"○○\"*. The *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) says: *\"○，suí cóng yě\"* (随从也, \"to follow\").\n\nThus, *Guangyun* (广韵) likely used *\"luò\"* (录) in its meaning.\n\nHong Yixian said: *\"Liáng liáng\"* (琭琭) is akin to *\"lù lù\"* (录录).\n\nThe *Guangya* (广雅) explains *\"lù lù\"* (逯逯) as *\"zhòng\"* (众, \"many\"). The *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) also states: *\"○，suí cóng yě\"* (随从也, \"to follow\").\n\nThese characters are used interchangeably.\n\nWang Bi’s version reads: *\"Guì wù yǐ duō ér jiàn jiàn, luò luò, shí jiān mào\"* (贵物以多而见贱。 落落，石坚貌。 石本贱物，以坚而自贞，是以两不欲也。), meaning: *\"Precious things are seen as cheap when they are many. 'Luò luò' (落落) is the firm appearance of stone. Stone is originally a cheap thing, yet it remains firm and steadfast, thus both are not desired.\"*\n\nThe *Yanzi Chunqiu* (晏子春秋) *Inner Chapters* (内篇) *Questions* (问) *Second Part* (下) states: *\"Jiān yǐ shí hū!

      "translated_text": "Xúnzǐ’s *Effort in Learning* (劝学篇) reads *“yān màn wàng shēn”* (怠慢忘身), while the *Great Rites of Dài* (大戴礼·劝学篇) renders *“wàng”* (忘) as *“wáng”* (亡). In the *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋·权勋篇), it states *“shì wàng jīng guó zhī shèjì ér bù xù wú zhòng yě”* (是忘荆国之社稷而不恤吾众也), and similarly, the *Han Feizi* (十过篇) and *Huáinánzǐ* (人间篇) use *“wàng”* (忘) as *“wáng”* (亡). These serve as further evidence.\n\nThe *Shī* (诗·绿衣) states *“xīn zhī yōu yǐ, hé wéi qí wáng”* (心之忧矣，曷维其亡), with Zhèng’s annotation *“wáng zhī yán wàng yě”* (亡之言忘也), following the same pattern.\n\nThe *Yìjīng Liè Jiě* (周易·略例) declares:\n*“Cún yán zhě, fēi dé xiàng zhě yě; cún xiàng zhě, fēi dé yì zhě yě.\nWàng yán zhě, nǎi dé xiàng zhě yě; wàng xiàng zhě, nǎi dé yì zhě yě.”*\n(存言者，非得象者也；存象者，非得意者也。\n忘言者，乃得象者也；忘象者，乃得意者也.)\n\nHere, *“cún”* (存) and *“wàng”* (忘) are paired opposites, aligning with the passage’s structure. This does not suffice to elucidate the *Dao*.\n\nLǔ Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes that the *Dūnhuáng* manuscript includes *“zhī”* (之) after *“xiào”* (笑). Thus, the original text reads:\n*“Jiàn yán yǒu zhī”* (建言有之).\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) observes that the Imperial Commentary lacks the *“gù”* (故) character. My examination reveals that the editions by Xíng Xuán (邢玄), Jǐng Fú (景福), Qìngyáng (庆阳), Pánxī (磻溪), Lóuzhèng (楼正), Gāo Yì (高翿), and Shìmǎchōng (室町本) align with the Imperial Commentary. The *Wǔnèi Dūnyǐ* (武内敦乙本) and Gǔ Huān’s (顾欢) editions insert *“shì yǐ”* (是以) after *“jiàn yán”* (建言). Lǔ Zhènyù states that the *Dūnhuáng* text reads *“shì yǐ jiàn yán yǒu zhī yuē”* (是以建言有之曰). My review confirms that the Fù Yì (傅奕) and Fàn (范) editions also include *“yuē”* (曰).\n\nFàn Yìngyuán (范应元) notes that Wáng Bì (王弼), Sūn Dēng (孙登), and Ruǎn Xián (阮咸) follow the ancient manuscripts, while the Héshànggōng (河上公) edition omits *“yuē”* (曰). Xí Dòng (奚侗) argues that *“jiàn yán”* (建言) likely refers to an ancient text title.\n\nGāo Hēng (高亨) suggests *“jiàn yán”* (建言) may be the title of a book referenced by Lǎozǐ.\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子·人间世篇) cites *“fǎ yán”* (法言), the *Hùguānzǐ* (鹖冠子·天权篇) references *“yì yán”* (逸言), and the *Guǐgǔzǐ* (鬼谷子·谋篇) invokes *“yīn yán”* (阴言). The *Hànshū Yìwénzhì* (汉书·艺文志) lists *“huáng yán”* (谰言), with Bān Gu’s annotation *“bù zhī zhǔzhe”* (不知作者), demonstrating that naming texts with *“yán”* (言) was a common ancient practice.\n\n---\n明道若昧，进道若退，\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes that *“ruò lèi”* (若类) is rendered *“ruò chǎn”* (若颣) in the Imperial Commentary and Wáng Bì’s (王弼) edition.\n\nMy examination reveals:\n- *“Jìn dào ruò tuì”* (进道若退) has *“tuì”* (退) marked *“○”* in the Imperial Commentary.\n- Fù Yì (傅奕), Péng Zhì (彭耜), Lín Xīyì (林希逸), and Zhào Mèngfǔ (赵孟俯) place this sentence after *“yí dào ruò lèi”* (夷道若类).\n- The *“lèi”* (类) character appears in the *Shìwén* (释文), *Héshànggōng* (河上公), *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Nǎijuàn* (柰卷), and *Gǔ Huān* (顾欢) editions, while Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) use *“chǎn”* (颣).\n\nFàn (范) states:\n*“Chǎn”* (颣), in ancient manuscripts, is pronounced *“lěi”* (耒), referring to a silk node. The *Héshànggōng* (河上公) edition uses *“lèi”* (类). I follow the ancient manuscript here.\n\nMy review confirms *“chǎn”* (颣) and *“lèi”* (类) were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Guǎngyǎ* (广雅·释言) defines *“chǎn”* (颣) as *“jié”* (节), and the *Tōngsúwén* (通俗文) states *“duō jié yuē chǎn”* (多节曰颣). The *Jiǎnwén Zhù* (简文注) for *“yí dào ruò chǎn”* (夷道若颣) explains *“cī”* (疵, flaw). The *Huáinánzǐ Fànlùn* (淮南子·泛论) describes *“míngyuè zhī zhū, bùnéng wú chǎn”* (明月之珠，不能无颣), with the annotation *“chǎn, pán ruò sī zhī jié chǎn yě”* (颣，盘若丝之结颣也). Borrowed as *“lì”* (戾), the *Zuǒzhuàn Zhāoshí* (左传·昭十六) uses *“xíng zhī pō chǎn”* (刑之颇颣), with Shì Zhù (服注) defining it as *“bù píng”* (不平, unevenness). Since *“píng”* (平) and *“bù píng”* (不平) are opposites, *“yí dào ruò chǎn”* (夷道若颣) signifies *“the Way of uniformity appears flawed.”*\n\n---\n上德若谷，大白若辱，\nWǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) notes that the *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) manuscripts render *“gǔ”* (谷) as *“sú”* (俗). Lǔ Zhènyù (罗振玉) observes that *“dà bái ruò rǔ”* (大白若辱) appears before *“shàng dé ruò gǔ”* (上德若谷) in the *Dūnhuáng* text.\n\nMy examination of the *Lǔjuàn Dūnwù* (罗卷敦戊本) confirms *“gǔ”* (谷) is not written as *“sú”* (俗), differing from the *Fǎjīng Dūnyǐ* (法京敦乙本). Chéng Xuányīng (成玄英) explains:\n*“Gǔ”* (谷) was also written as *“sú”* (俗), meaning *“even one who embodies virtue can forget it, indistinguishable from the vulgar.”*\n\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states:\n*“All editions render it ‘gǔ’ (谷), a shorthand for ‘sú’ (俗). High virtue appears as the common crowd—embodying the meaning of blending with the world.”*\n\nAdditionally, the *Dàozàng Wángběn* (道藏王本) writes *“tài”* (太) instead of *“dà”* (大). The *“rǔ”* (辱) character is marked *“○”* in Fù (傅) and Fàn (范) editions.\n\nFàn (范) explains:\n*“○”* is pronounced *“rǔ”* (辱), meaning *“black filth.”* Ancient manuscripts follow this, while the *Héshànggōng* (河上公) edition uses *“rǔ”* (辱).\n\nBì Yàn (毕沅) notes:\n*“○”* is rendered *“rǔ”* (辱) in the *Héshànggōng* (河上公) and Wáng Bì (王弼) editions. Those writing *“○”* follow the principle of *“yǐ bái zào zī”* (以白造缁, transforming white into black). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) does not list *“○”*.\n\nMy review confirms the *Yùpiàn* (玉篇) defines *“○”* as *“gòuhēi”* (垢黑, filth and blackness), an ancient form of *“rǔ”* (辱). The *Guǎngyǎ Shìgǔ* (广雅·释诂三) states *“rǔ, wū yě, yòu è yě”* (辱, 污也, 又恶也, defilement and evil). The *Yílì Shìhūn Lǐ* (仪礼·士昏礼) annotates *“jīn wú zǐ rǔ”* (今吾子辱) as *“yǐ bái zào zī yuē rǔ”* (以白造缁曰辱). The *Sūwèn Qìjiāo Biàn Dàlùn* (素问·气交变大论) states *“hēi qì nǎi rǔ”* (黑气乃辱). Since *“rǔ”* (辱) carries the meaning of blackness, opposing *“bái”* (白), the phrase *“dà bái ruò rǔ”* (大白若辱) follows this contrast.\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) clarifies:\n*“Rǔ”* (辱) in the *Yílì Shìhūn Lǐ* (仪礼·士昏礼) annotation *“yǐ bái zào zī yuē rǔ”* (以白造缁曰辱) aligns with this usage. Transforming white into black—removing traces of defilement—hence *“rǔ”* (辱).\n\nThis reflects Lǎozǐ’s original intent, corroborated by the *Shīchuán* (诗传) and *Lǐzhù* (礼注).\n\n---\n广德若不足，\nMy examination of the *Zhuāngzǐ Yùyán Piān* (庄子·寓言篇) reveals:\n*“Lǎozǐ yuē: ‘Ér suīsuī xūxū, ér wéi yǔ jū? Dà bái ruò rǔ, shèng dé ruò bùzú.’”* (老子曰：“而睢睢盱盱，而谁与居？ 大白若辱，盛德若不足。”)\nThe final two sentences match this chapter.",

It is suspected that *“guǎng dé”* (广德) is a corrupted form of *“shèng dé”* (盛德).\n\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) argues that this passage should follow the *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子), and *“shèng”* (盛) is the original text, which is correct. Yán Zūn (严遵)’s version as *“shèng dé”* (盛德) should be adopted.\n\nLǔ Juǎn (罗卷) renders *“ruò bùzú”* (若不足) as *“ruò rú”* (若濡), differing from all other versions.\n\n**Jiàn dé ruò tōu** (建德若偷),\nJìu yě Zhíxǐ (狩野直喜) states: *“Héshàng Gōng běn* (河上公本) and *Wáng Bì běn* (王弼本) originally had differing texts, but later scholars, following *Bùshì Yìxíng* (辅嗣义行), altered the text based on *Wáng Bì*’s version, causing the two to merge indistinguishably. Fortunately, old manuscript copies (*jiùzhāo* 旧钞) suffice to correct the errors in the printed editions.\n\nIn Chapter 41, *“jiàn dé ruò tōu, zhì zhēn ruò yú”* (建德若偷，质真若渝), this version (*qiānzhī’ān* 谦之案: referring to Lǔ Juǎn’s text) renders *“tōu”* (偷) as *“ruò yú”* (若揄). The annotation reads: *“Yú”* (揄) is the same as *“yǐn”* (引), as proven by the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文手部): *“Yú, yǐn yě”* (揄，引也). The *Hànfēizǐ Dìxié Piān* (韩非子饰邪篇) states: *“Páng yuǎn yú bīng ér nán”* (庞援揄兵而南). The *Hànshū Lǐyuèzhì* (汉书礼乐志) mentions *“shén zhī yú”* (神之揄), with *Yán Shīgǔ* (颜师古) annotating: *“Yú, yǐn yě”* (揄，引也). Thus, the evidence confirms their difference.\n\nIt is clear that the two schools’ original texts differ, and their interpretations also vary. Later generations, lacking discernment, arbitrarily changed *“yú”* (揄) to *“tōu”* (偷) to align with *Wáng Bì*’s version, and the annotation was also altered to *“tōu”*, rendering *Héshàng Gōng*’s original meaning entirely obscure.\n\nMoreover, it is noted that the *Táng Jǐnglóng Kèshí* (唐景龙刻石) reads *“jiàn dé ruò tōu”* (建德若偷), … thus proving that *Héshàng Gōng*’s version was corrupted by *Wáng Bì*’s as early as the Tang Dynasty. *Qiānzhī’ān* (谦之案): Indeed, *Héshàng Gōng*’s version was corrupted by *Wáng Bì*’s. Only this sentence—*Dùnhuáng běn* (敦煌本) omits it, while *Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng Bì* both have *“tōu”* (偷), matching the stone inscription.

The character is also written as *“tōu”* (偷). *Zhū Qūnshēng* (朱骏声) explains: *“Tōu”* (偷) is borrowed as *“yú”* (愉), in the *Hànshū Shíhuòzhì* (汉书食货志): *“Mín tōu gānshí hào yī”* (民偷甘食好衣). The *Lù Wēnshū zhuàn* (路温舒传) uses *“tōu wéi yīqiè”* (偷为一切), with the annotation *“gǒuqiě yě”* (苟且也). The *Lǐjì Biǎojì* (礼记表记) states *“ān sì yuē tōu”* (安肆曰偷). The *Zuǒ Wén shíqī zhuàn* (左文十七传) mentions *“Qí jūn zhī yǔ tōu”* (齐君之语偷), with the annotation *“gǒuqiě”* (苟且). Additionally, the *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋) says *“jiāo mín yǐ tōu lè”* (剿民以偷乐), with the annotation *“yú jiùxìng yě”* (犹侥幸也). The *Hòuhàn Zhāng Héng zhuàn* (后汉张衡传) states *“suī àoyóu yǐ tōu lè xī”* (虽遨游以偷乐兮), with the annotation *“huái ān yě”* (怀安也). The *Ěryǎ Shìyán* (尔雅释言) defines *“tiāo”* (佻) as *“tōu yě”* (偷也). *Xúnzǐ Xiūshēn* (荀子修身) and *Fēi Shí’ěr zǐ* (非十二子) both use *“tōu rú”* (偷儒), with the annotation *“dāng wéi shū, gǒu bì yú shì yě”* (当为输，苟避于事也). *“Tōu”* (偷) is also used as *“yú”* (揄).\n\nFrom the above, *“tōu”* (偷), *“shū”* (输), *“yú”* (揄), and *“shū”* (愉) were interchangeable in ancient usage, and *“tōu”* (偷) is the original text (*gùshū* 故书).\n\nYú Yì (俞樾) states: *“Tōu”* (偷) in *Héshàng Gōng*’s annotation means *“ruòkě tōu yǐn, shǐ kōngxū yě”* (若可偷引，使空虚也). *Wáng Bì*’s annotation reads: *“Tōu, pǐ yě”* (偷，匹也). *“Jiàn dé zhě tōu”* (建德者偷), meaning one who upholds **Dao**/**Way** and **Virtue/Power** acts like a simple, unassuming matchmaker (*pǐ* 匹), neither imposing nor contriving, thus resembling *“tōu”* (偷) as *“pǐ”* (匹).\n\nHowever, the meaning of *“tōu pǐ”* (偷匹) is unattested in antiquity, and its interpretation is difficult to grasp.\n\nNow, *“jiàn”* (建) should be read as *“jiàn”* (健). The *Shìmíng Shìyányǔ* (释名释言语) states: *“Jiàn, jiàn yě, néng yǒu suǒ jiànwéi yě”* (健，建也，能有所建为也). Thus, *“jiàn”* (建) and *“jiàn”* (健) share the same pronunciation, and the meaning also becomes clear. *“Jiàn dé zhě tōu”* (健德若偷) means that **Virtue/Power** that is robust and vigorous (*jiàn* 健) paradoxically appears as lazy and indolent (*tōu* 偷).\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the preceding sentence *“guǎng dé ruò bùzú”* (广德若不足).\n\n**Zhì zhēn ruò yú** (质真若渝),\n*Qiānzhī’ān* (谦之案): *Fù Yì*’s version reads *“zhì zhí ruò shū”* (质直若输), and *Nài Juǎn* (柰卷) also renders *“zhēn”* (真) as *“zhí”* (直). *“Yú”* (渝) and *“shū”* (输) are interchangeable in ancient script.\n\nBì Qián (毕沅) states: *“Héshàng Gōng* and *Wáng Bì* both have *“yú”* (渝), which aligns with ancient usage, such as *“yú píng”* (渝平) in the *Chūnqiū* (春秋) being *“shū píng”* (输平).\n\n*“Shū”* (输) is borrowed as *“yú”* (愉), carrying the sense of *“gǒuqiě huái ān”* (苟且怀安), and is also used as *“yú”* (渝). The *“zhēn”* (真) in *“zhì zhēn”* (质真) is a corrupted form of *“zhí”* (直). *“Zhì ruò yú”* (质若渝) refers to the sincere and unadorned (*zhì* 质) individual whose actions are sluggish and weak (*yú* 渝), resembling one who is dull and foolish (*shū* 输).",

      "translated_text": "「Liu Shīpèi states: Examining the passage above, *“Guǎngdé ruò bùzú, Jiàndé ruò tōu”* (广德若不足，建德若偷), this parallels the earlier paired phrases, and it is suspected that *“zhēn”* (真) should also be read as *“dé”* (德). Indeed, the character *“dé”* (德) in the original text is written as *“”* (a variant of 德), resembling *“zhēn”* (真).\n\n*“Zhìdé”* (质德) aligns with *“Guǎngdé”* (广德) and *“Jiàndé”* (建德) in structure. *“Guǎngdé”* (广德) signifies broad and expansive **virtue** (德), contrasting with *“bùzú”* (不足); *“Jiàndé”* (建德) denotes firm and resolute **virtue** (德), opposing *“tōu”* (偷) (following Yu’s interpretation); *“Zhìdé”* (质德) represents unadorned **virtue** (德), countering *“yú”* (渝). These three **virtues** (德) are thus paired in meaning.\n\n大方无隅,\n大器晚成,\n大音希声,\n大象无形.\n\n**Dao** (道) is subtle and nameless.\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): The *Fǎjīng* (法京) edition reads *“wú”* (无) as *“wú”* (无), while the *Luójuàn* (罗卷) consistently renders it as *“wú”* (无).\n\nYì Shùndǐng (易顺鼎) remarks: *“Dàfāng wúhuán”* (大方无隅) is recorded in *Moral Reflections on the Way* (道德指归论) as *“Dàfāng bùjǔ”* (大方不矩).\n\nGù Guǎngqì (顾广圻) notes: *“Dàyīn xīshēng”* (大音希声), the *Fù* (傅) edition renders *“xī”* (希) as *“xī”* (稀), which is the same character.\n\nWáng Xiānshèn (王先慎) observes: The *Fù* (傅) edition reads *“yīn”* (音) as *“yán”* (言), differing entirely from all other versions.\n\nLǐ Qiào (李翘) states: *“Lǜshì Chūnyǒu Lèchéng Piān”* (吕氏春秋乐成篇) begins with *“Dàzhì bùxíng, dàqì wǎnchéng, dàyīn xīshēng”* (大智不形，大器晚成，大音希声), which does not cite **Laozi** (老子).\n\nIt is only **Dao** (道) that is both generous and good.\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: *“Shàn yú qiě shàn”* (善贷且善) is rendered *“qiěchéng”* (且成) in other editions.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version reads *“dài”* (贷) as *“shǐ”* (始).\n\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): The *Lùoluó* (譣罗) and *Dūnhuáng Yǐběn* (敦煌乙本) omit the *“wúmíng”* (无名) clause; thus, *“dài”* (贷) being read as *“shǐ”* (始) aligns with **Laozi**’s *Yìběn* (义本). The *Fù* (傅) edition, along with the *Zhūrōng* (诸王本) and *Shìzhōngdīng* (室町本), reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), while the *Fàn* (范) edition renders *“shàn huò qiě shànchéng”* (善货且善成). It is said: *“Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) follow the ancient version; *Héshàng Gōng* (河上公) reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), and now we follow the ancient version.” However, the *Yílántáng Yánběn* (怡兰堂严本) also reads *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成), differing from the *Fàn* (范) edition, which likely omits one *“shàn”* (善) character, while the stele version omits *“chéng”* (成) at the end of the sentence. It is proper to augment according to the *Fàn* (范) edition.\n\n*“Chéng”* (成) rhymes with *“chéng”* (成), *“shēng”* (声), *“xíng”* (形), *“míng”* (名).\n*“Dài”* (贷) shares meaning with **Zhuangzi**’s *“Huàdài wànwù ér mín fùshì”* (化贷万物而民弗恃) in *Yìngdìwáng Piān* (应帝王篇), where it describes **Laozi**’s words.\n\n*“Dàoxuàn wúmíng”* (道隐无名) also echoes **Zhuangzi**’s *“Yǒu mòjǔ míng, shǐ wù zìxǐ”* (有莫举名，使物自喜), meaning the attainment of **dharma** (功) without claiming fame, standing in the incomprehensible, and wandering in the boundless.\n\nYú Shěngwú (于省吾) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition reads *“Fūwéidào, shànyú qiěshàn”* (夫唯道，善贷且善), likely omitting *“chéng”* (成). The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version reads *“shǐ”* (始) for *“dài”* (贷), which is a phonetic transformation.\n\nFrom the *Zhōuyǔ* (周语): *“Chúnmíng zé zhōng”* (纯明则终), commentary: *“Zhōng”* (终) means *“chéng”* (成).\nAgain, *“Gù gāomíng lìngzhōng”* (故高明令终), commentary: *“Zhōng”* (终) is synonymous with *“chéng”* (成).\nFrom the *Shū* (书), *“Xiāosháo jiǔchéng”* (箫韶九成), *Zhèng Zhù* (郑注) states: *“Chéng”* (成) is equivalent to *“zhōng”* (终).\nThus, *“chéng”* (成) and *“zhōng”* (终) are interchangeable, with the same meaning.\n\nThen *“shànyú qiěchéng”* (善贷且成) is equivalent to *“shànyú qièzhōng”* (善贷且终).\nChapter Sixty-Four reads *“shèngzhōng rúshǐ”* (慎终如始), where *“zhōng”* (终) and *“shǐ”* (始) are paired in meaning.\n\n【Sound and Rhyme】Jiāngshì (江氏) reads this chapter in the following rhyme scheme:\n- *“Xíng, wáng”* (行、亡) in the *Yángbù* (阳部) rhyme.\n- *“Xiào, dào”* (笑、道) in the *Yōuxiào tōngyùn* (幽、宵通韵) rhyme, with *“dào”* (道) rhyming with *“dào”* (盗).\n\n- *“Mèi, tuì, lèi”* (昧、退、类) in the *Zhǐbù* (脂部) rhyme, *“mèi”* (昧) pronounced *“mèi”* (寐), *“tuì”* (退) as *“tùi”* (吐位反).\n\n- *“Gǔ, rǔ, zú, tōu, yú, huán”* (谷、辱、足、偷、渝、隅) in the *Hòubù* (侯部) rhyme, *“yú”* (渝) as *“yù”* (喻蓲反), *“huán”* (隅) as *“é”* (俄蓲反).\n\n- *“Chéng, shēng, xíng, míng, chéng”* (成、声、形、名、成) in the *Gēngbù* (耕部) rhyme.\n\n**Qiānzhī’ān** (谦之案): *“Xiào”* (笑) belongs to the *Xiàobù* (宵部), *“dào”* (道) to the *Yōubù* (幽部), with *Yōu* (幽) and *Xiào* (宵) being interchangeable. *“Wéidào”* (惟道) should rhyme with *“dào”* (盗), which seems incorrect. *“Dào”* (道) is *“túhào”* (徒皓切), while *“dào”* (道) in ancient times was *“túgǔ”* (徒苟切). *“Dào”* (道) is an initial sound, rhyming with *“shǒu”* (守), *“jiù”* (咎) in Chapter Nine; with *“yǒu”* (有) in Chapter Ten; and with *“yǒu”* (牖), *“shào”* (少) in Chapter Forty-Seven. These are the proofs of its usage.\n\nFurthermore, *“gǔ, rǔ, zú, tōu, yú, huán”* (谷、辱、足、偷、渝、隅) belong to one rhyme, with *Yáo Wéntián* (姚文田) and *Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢) dividing them into *“gǔ, rǔ, zú”* (谷、辱、足) in the *Liùxià rùshēng* (六屋入声) rhyme, and *“tōu, yú, huán”* (偷、渝、隅) in the *Shísān hòu píngshēng* (十三侯平声) rhyme.\n\nAdditionally, the *“tōu”* (偷) in *“Jiàndé ruò tōu”* (建德若偷) is rendered *“tōu”* (偷) in the *Gāoběn* (高本) and *“shū”* (输) in the *Hànběn* (汉本), both of which rhyme.\n\nGù Yánwú (顾炎武) states: *“Xíng”* (行), in ancient pronunciation, was *“háng”* (杭).

Again, *“Gù ruòzhī shèngqiáng, róuzhī shènggāng”* (故弱之胜强，柔之胜刚) reads *“tōu”* (偷) as *“tú”* (俞) in the *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正卷五十二庚). He also notes: The four sentences follow a two-rhyme pattern, with the particle *“zhī”* (之) sometimes present and sometimes absent, as seen in other poems.»\n\n**Laozi** states: *“Shàngshì wéndào, qín ér xíngzhī; zhōngshì wéndào, ruòcún ruòwáng”* (上士闻道，勤而行之；中士闻道，若存若亡), where *“xíng”* (行) rhymes with *“wáng”* (亡).\nAgain, in the *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正卷十七), under *“Shísān mò”* (十三末): *“Mèi”* (昧), in examining ancient texts, is sometimes pronounced with a departing tone and sometimes with an entering tone. With a departing tone, it is *“mòpèi”* (莫佩反). In **Laozi**’s *“Míngdào ruò mèi, yídào ruò lèi, jìndào ruò tuì”* (明道若昧，夷道若类，进道若退).\nAgain, in the *Hòubù* (侯部) of *Tángyùn zhèng* (卷六十九侯): *“Tōu”* (偷), in ancient pronunciation, was *“tú”* (俞).

Since *“yú”* (隅) rhymes with them, all words derived from *“yú”* (禺) belong to the same category as *“yú”* (隅), not merely those like *“ǒu”* (偶), *“ǒu”* (耦), *“ǒu”* (藕) collected in the *Hòu* (厚) department of *Tángyùn zhèng* (唐韵正).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **95 characters**, while the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), *Hé* (河), and *Wáng* (王) versions match it. The *Fù* (傅) version contains **97 characters**, and the *Fàn* (范) version has **98 characters**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *“Tóngyì dì sìshíyī”* (同异第四十一), the *Wáng* (王) version *“Sìshíyī zhāng”* (四十一章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *“Shàngshì wéndào zhāng dì sìshíyī”* (上士闻道章第四十一).\n\n**Chapter 42**\nDao/Way generates One (一), One generates Two (二), Two generates Three (三), and Three generates all things.\n\nDeng Tingzhen’s annotation: The *Huáinánzǐ Tiānwén Trùn* (淮南子天文训) states: *“Dào rì guī, shǐ yú yī”* (道日规，始于一). Wang Pennisun (王念孙) remarks: *“Rì guī”* (日规) does not align with the meaning of the surrounding text; it is a mistaken interpolation from *“gù shuō guī shēng jǔ shāi”* (故曰规生矣杀) above.\n\nThe *Sòngshū Lǜshū* (宋书律书) reads: *“Dào shǐ yú yī”* (道始于一), without *“rì guī”* (日规).\n\nToday’s annotation confirms Wang’s explanation. The *Huáinán Yì* (淮南义) cites **Laozi**’s chapter, thus the following passage states: *“Yī ér bù shēng, gù fēn ér wéi yīnyáng, yīnyáng hé hé ér wànwù shēng. Gù shuō yī shēng èr, èr shēng sān, sān shēng wànwù”* (一而不生，故分而为阴阳，阴阳合和万物生。 故曰一生二，二生三，三生万物).\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ Tiāndì Piān* (庄子天地篇) states: *“Tàichū yǒu wúwú, yǒu wúmíng, yī zhī suǒ qǐ, yǒu yī ér wèi xíng”* (泰初有无无，有无名，一之所起，有一而未形), which echoes **Laozi**’s *“Wúmíng, tiāndì shǐ”* (无名，天地始) and *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一).\n\nThe *Huángdì Nèijīng Tàisū Juàn shíjiǔ Zhīzhēnshí Piān Yángshàngshàn Zhù* (黄帝内经太素卷十九知针石篇杨上善注) also states: *“Cóng Dào shēng yī, wèi zhī pǔ yě; yī fēn wéi èr, wèi zhī tiāndì yě; cóng èr shēng sān, wèi zhī yīnyáng hé qì yě; cóng sān yǐ shēng wànwù, fēn wéi jiǔ yě, sì shí, rìyuè nǎiwéi wànwù”* (从道生一，谓之朴也； 一分为二，谓天地也； 从二生三，谓阴阳和气也； 从三以生万物，分为九野、四时、日月乃至万物). These words are also derived from here.\n\nDeng further notes: *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一), where *“yī”* (一) refers to *qì* (气). The *Zhuāngzǐ Zhīběi Yóu Piān* (庄子知北游篇) states: *“Tōng tiānxià yī qì ér, shèngrén gù guì yī”* (通天下一气耳，圣人故贵一). Li Daochun (李道纯) remarks: *“Dào shēng yī”* (道生一) means *“vacuity and nothingness generate One *qì* (气)”; *“yī shēng èr”* (一生二) means *“One *qì* (气) differentiates into Yin and Yang”*.\n\nZhao Zhijiàn (赵志坚) states: *“Yī”* (一) is *“yuánqì”* (元气), the beginning of Dao/Way. *“In ancient times, all things under heaven, including Yin and Yang, received One *qì* (气) and thus came to life”*.\n\nDàtiān Qíngxuān (大田晴轩) states: *“Yī èr sān”* (一二三) has been interpreted in various ways by scholars. *“I examine the *Huáinánzǐ Tiānwén Trùn*: ‘*Guī shēng jǔ shāi, héng zhǎng quán cáng, shéng jū zhōngyāng, wéi sìshí gēn* (规生矩杀，衡长权藏，绳居中央，为四时根). *Dào rì guī, shǐ yú yī, yī ér bù shēng, gù fēn ér wéi yīnyáng, yīnyáng hé hé ér wànwù shēng.

This interpretation is most fitting.\n\nHe also states: *“Dào”* (道) is *“principle”*; *“yī”* (一) is *“One *qì* (气)”*. As *Zhuāng Zhōu* (庄周) says: *“Yī zhī suǒ qǐ, yǒu yī ér wèi xíng”* (一之所起，有一而未形). *“Èr”* (二) is *“Yin and Yang”*; *“sān”* (三) is *“the initial emergence of form, *qì* (气), and substance”*.\n\nIn **Chapter 14**, it states: *“Cǐ sān zhě bùkě zhì jié, gù hùn ér wéi yī”* (此三者不可致诘，故混而为一). This refers to the aforementioned three.\n\nThe meaning is: *“Dao/Way generates One *qì* (气); One *qì* (气) differentiates into Yin and Yang; *qì* (气) flows and transforms between heaven and earth, taking form and substance, and then all things are born. Hence, it is said: ‘Three generates all things.’”* (万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和).\n\nDeng Tingzhen’s annotation: The *Huáinánzǐ Jīngshén Trùn* (淮南子精神训) quotes: *“Wànwù bèi yīn ér bào yáng, chōng qì yǐ wéi hé”* (万物背阴而抱阳，冲气以为和).

The *Wáng* (王) version also includes *«chū yú»* (出于) twice. In *Wáng Bì*’s (王弼) preceding annotation, *“Qì wú suǒ bù rù, shuǐ wú suǒ bù chū yú jīng”* (气无所不入，水无所不出于经), the phrase *«wú suǒ bù chū yú jīng»* (无所不出于经) should read *«wú suǒ bù jīng»* (无所不经), paralleling *«wú suǒ bù rù»* (无所不入). The *«chū yú»* (出于) must belong to the main text above *«wúyǒu»* (无有). It appears the *Wáng* (王) version also reads *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn,”* with *«chū yú»* (出于) mistakenly placed in the annotation.\n\n*Fù Yì* (傅奕) aligns with *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子).\n\nLiú Wéntiǎn said: The current *Lǎozǐ* (老子) *Héshànggōng Zhāngjù* (河上公章句) *“Biān yòng dì sìshí sān zhāng”* (偏用第四十三) reads: *“Tiānxià zhī zhì róu, chěngcèng tiānxià zhī zhì jiān, wúyǒu rù wújiàn,”* with *«chū»* (出) omitted before *«wúyǒu»* (无有). This can be supplemented based on the *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) citation. The *Dàoyìng* (道应) passage cites *“Chū yú wúyǒu, rù yú wújiàn,”* likely altered by later scholars.\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) annotation states: *“Wúyǒu, wèi Dào yě. Dào wú xíngzhì, suǒnéng chū rù wújiàn.”* (无有，谓道也。道无形质，故能出入无间.) This suggests the version he consulted still lacked *«chū»* (出).\n\nWáng Dào said: *«Wújiàn»* (无间) means *«wúxì»* (无隙, no gap). A single *zhàng* (丈) of water can float a ten-thousand *hú* (斛) vessel; a six *chǐ* (尺) rein can guide a thousand-*lǐ* (里) horse. The utmost gentleness riding the utmost firmness—this is the case. The *qi* (气) of Heaven and Earth, though formless, can penetrate metal and stone; the light of the sun and moon, though without substance, can pierce through lattice windows. *«Wúyǒu rù yú wújiàn»* (无有入于无间)—this is the case. Thus, one knows the virtue/power of *wuwei* (无为).\n\nYán Kějūn said: The *Yùzhù* (御注) reads *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì yì,”* while *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) include *«zhī»* (之), omitting the repeated *«yì»* (益).\n\nWèi Jiàosūn said: Yán Kějūn incorrectly noted the *«zhī»* (之) and *«yì»* (益) in *Yùzhù* (御注), missing *«wú»* (吾) above *«shì»* (是).\n\nLuó Zhèn-yù said: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) versions lack *«wú»* (吾) and *«zhī»* (之).\n\n**Qiánzhī’s annotation:** All *Hé* (河) and *Wáng* (王) versions read *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì,”* with *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Shìmíng* (室町), and *Fàn* (范) versions identical, *«wú»* (无) rendered as *«wú»* (无). *Gù Huān* (顾欢) reads *“Wú shì yǐ zhī wúwéi yǒuyì,”* while Péng Zhì renders *“Shì yǐ zhī wúwéi zhī yǒuyì yě.”*\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid, the virtue/power of *wuwei* (无为), few in the world can attain.\n\n**Qiánzhī’s annotation:** The *Fù* (傅) version renders *«xī»* (希) as *«xǐ»* (稀), with *«yǐ»* (矣) appended below.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the explanation of *zào* (躁) as *\"dòngtǐ láo xíng\"* (动体劳形) is insightful, yet it fails to account for the fact that even in a warm room, beside a furnace, layered with fox and badger skins, wrapped in fluffy wool, one still cannot resist the cold—this contradicts common experience. The error stems from interpreting *zào* (躁) as *zào* (燥) in the common sense.\n\nIn truth, *zào* (躁) is *zào* (燥), but *zào* (燥) is the楚方言 (Chu dialect) used in *Lǎozǐ*’s (老子) book, specifically referring to *furnace flames*. The *Shīyán Yǔ* (释言语) states: *\"The Chu (楚) call fire *zào* (燥), the Qi (齐) call it *huǐ* (毁), and the Wu (吴) call it *tāo* (焚).\"* Since *Lǎozǐ* (老子) was a Chu (楚) man, he used *zào* (躁). *\"Zào (躁) overcomes cold\"* is paired with *\"jìng (静) overcomes heat\"* (静胜热).\n\nThe character *jìng* (静) shares its meaning with *jìng* (寂). In the *Chūcí* (楚辞) *Lǚfén Shìwén* (汝坟释文), it is noted: *\"The Chu (楚) call stillness *jìng* (寂), and the Qi (齐) call it *jìng* (静).\"* The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: *\"寂 (jìng), from 水 (shuǐ, water), the sound of 静 (jìng).\"* This implies that clear, still water can overcome heat, while furnace flames can repel cold. The phrase *\"clearing and stillness as the Dao/Way (正) for all under heaven\"* (清静以为天下正) is found in the *Dàchéng Ruò Quē* (大成若缺) chapter, though some editions omit the *\"yǐ\"* (以) character. My examination shows that the editions of *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Shìmáng* (室町), *Gù Huān* (顾欢), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) all include *\"yǐ\"* (以). The *Fàn* (范) edition further adds *\"zhī\"* (知) before *\"qīng\"* (清), stating: *\"The ancient edition has the characters '知以' (zhī yǐ).\"* The term *\"qīngjìng\"* (清静) in *Yán Zūn*’s (严遵) text and in *Yáng Xióng*’s (扬雄) *Jiě Jiào* (解嘲) annotation aligns with *\"néng qīng néng jìng\"* (能清能静).\n\nThe *Shìjì* (史记) *Lǎozǐ Zhuàn* (老子传) states: *\"Lǐ Ěr (李耳) transforms himself through *wúwéi* (无为), and his *qīngjìng* (清静) brings *zhèng* (正) to himself.\"* This is an abbreviated passage. The *Chéngshū* (成疏) commentary explains: *\"Clear, still, and tranquil, one can benefit oneself and others, and correct what is deviant—thus, it is the Dao/Way (正) for all under heaven.\"* The *Dūnghuáng* (敦煌) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) editions, as well as the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition, read *\"zhèng\"* (正), not *\"zhèng\"* (政). *Wǔnèi* (武内) mistakenly corrected it to *\"zhèng\"* (政), claiming: *\"The Dūnghuáng (敦), Jǐngfú (景), and Suìzhōu (遂) editions all read '政' (zhèng).\"* *Jǐng Héshàng* (警河上) annotated: *\"If one can clear and still, then one becomes the eternal ruler for all under heaven.\"* Thus, *Héshàng* (河上) rendered it as *\"néng qīng néng jìng, wéi tiānxià zhèng\"* (能清能静，为天下正).\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) states:\n*\"Great completion resembles deficiency; its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness; its use is boundless.\"*\n\n【Rhymes and Tones】 In this chapter, *Jiāng Shì* (江氏) rhyme readings are as follows:\n- *Quē* (缺) and *Bì* (敝) rhyme (祭部, *bì* pronounced as *biě* (蹩)),\n- *Chōng* (冲) and *Qióng* (穷) rhyme (中部),\n- *Qū* (屈), *Zhuō* (拙), *Nè* (讷), and *Rè* (热) rhyme (脂、祭通韵, *qū* pronounced as *quē* (缺), *zhuō* co-rhyming with *zé* (棁), *nè* co-rhyming with *nǚ* (奴, as in *nuè* 月反)).\n\n- *Jìng* (静) and *Zhèng* (正) rhyme (耕部).\n\n*Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢) notes:\n- *Quē* (缺) and *Bì* (弊) rhyme, stating: *\"'弊' (bì) is in the 祭部 (zhài bù) rhyme category, while '缺' (quē) is its 入声 (rù shēng, entering tone).\"*\n\nMy examination shows that *Yáo Wéntián* (姚文田) aligns with *Jiāng* (江), while *Dèng Tíngzhēn* (邓廷桢), *Gāo Běnhàn* (高本汉), *Xí Dòng* (奚侗), and *Chén Zhù* (陈柱) do not consider *\"rè\"* (热) as part of the rhyme scheme. *Lǐ Dàochún* (李道纯) suggests *\"bì\"* (弊) be co-rhymed as *\"biē\"* (鳖). *Gù Yànwǔ* (顾炎武) in his *Táng Yùn* (唐韵) *Zhèng Shíliù* (正十六屑) states that *\"quē\"* (缺) in the *去声 (qù shēng, departing tone)* is pronounced as *\"kǔhuì\"* (苦惠反), also written as *\"缺\"* (quē).",

Yet by the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the *\"chē\"* (车) character was already missing, and *Wèi* (魏) scholar *Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s annotation, though not far from *Zhāng Héng* (张衡), already omitted it.\nIt seems that initially, one character was accidentally dropped, and later scholars, unaware of the error, did not restore it.\n*\"Chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) rhyme, but omitting *\"chē\"* (车) leaves no rhyme.\n**My examination:** *\"Chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) do not rhyme; further explanation follows below.\n\n*Yì Shùndǐng* (易顺鼎) states: According to *Wénzǐ* (文子) *Jīngchéng piān* (精诚篇), it says:\n*\"Only those who travel at night can achieve this, hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields, and the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\n\nSome read *\"chē\"* (车) as connected to the previous sentence, which also supports *Wú Chéng* (吴澄)'s interpretation.\nHowever, the *Huáinán Lǎn* (淮南览) *Míngxùn* (冥训) states:\n*\"Hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields, and the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\nHere, *\"fèn\"* (粪) is followed by *\"ér\"* (而), so *\"chēguǐ\"* (车轨) should be read as a connected phrase.\n\n*Gāo* (高)'s annotation states:\n*\"'却走马以粪' (turn back the warhorses to till the fields) is a phrase from the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经). It means stopping the warhorses from running and using them to till the fields instead.\nAnother interpretation: When a ruler lacks **virtue/power**, warhorses are born in the suburbs, and the warhorses are used to till the fields, hence the tracks of chariots do not extend beyond distant lands.\"*\n\nIn the *Huáinán Lǎn* (淮南览), there are annotations by *Xǔ Shèng* (许慎) and *Gāo Yòu* (高诱). This second interpretation is likely *Xǔ Shèng* (许慎)'s, yet it aligns with *Gāo* (高)'s meaning.\nThe annotation by *Xuē Jiōng* (薛综) in *Dōngjīng fù* (东京赋) also cites the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) phrase *\"却走马以粪\"* (turn back the warhorses to till the fields), indicating that by the end of the Han Dynasty, those transmitting the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) had no *\"chē\"* (车) character, and *Zhāng Héng* (张衡) likely misread *Wénzǐ* (文子)!\n*Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s *\"yǐ fèn tián\"* (以粪田) correctly uses the original meaning.\nThe pronunciation of *\"chē\"* (车) and *\"jiāo\"* (郊) also does not align closely, and *Wú* (吴) assumes they rhyme, which is unclear.\n\nAgain, according to *Wénzǐ* (文子) *Zìrán piān* (自然篇), it states:\n*\"The footprints do not reach the borders of the neighboring states, and the chariot tracks do not extend beyond a thousand miles.\"*\nThis clearly shows *\"chēguǐ\"* (车轨) as a connected phrase.\n*He Shìzhào* (何氏焯) *Dúshū jì* (读书记) cites *Wénzǐ* (文子) as *\"fèn chē\"* (粪车), but *Lǐ* (李)'s annotation missed this and is incorrect.\n**My examination:** The annotations by *Zhāng Jǐngyáng* (张景阳) *Qī Mìng zhù* (七命注) cite *Wáng Bì* (王弼) as saying:\n*\"When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, cultivation of the fields is all that is needed, hence the warhorses are turned back to till the fields.\"*\nThe annotation by *Yán Shìgǔ* (颜师古) in *Hànshū* (汉书) *Xīyù zhuàn* (西域传) states:\n*\"The *Dàodéjīng* (道德经) says: 'When the **Dao/Way** prevails in the world, the warhorses are turned back to till the fields.'\"*\nIt is likely that *\"fèn\"* (粪) either has *\"wéi\"* (为) above it or *\"tián\"* (田) below it, or else it is a mistaken citation identical to *\"fèn chē\"* (粪车).\n\nThe *Hánfēi* (韩非) *Jiě Lǎozǐ* (解老) and *Yù Lǎozǐ* (喻老) both cite the same text as this stele.\nAdditionally, according to the *Yánsī Lùn* (盐铁论) *Wèitōng piān* (未通篇), it states:\n*\"At that time, the warhorses were turned back to till the fields. Later, military expeditions were frequently launched, and the warhorses were insufficient, so even the mares were sent into battle, hence the foals were born on the battlefield.\"*\n\nThis interpretation refers to the scarcity of warhorses in the army, where even mares were sent into battle, aligning with the ancient meaning of the *Dàodéjīng* (道德经).\n\n**The greatest crime is to desire what is not right;**\n**The greatest calamity is to not know contentment;**\n**The greatest misfortune is to covet what one desires.**\n\n*Yán Kějūn* (严可均) notes: *\"The greatest misfortune is to covet what one desires\"* is absent in *Wáng Bì* (王弼)'s version.\n*Luó Zhènyù* (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yùzhù* (御注), *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌), and *Jǐngfú* (景福) versions all have the sentence *\"The greatest crime is to desire what is not right\"*, and the *Shìwén* (释文) *Héshàng* (河上) version also includes it.\nThe character *\"dà\"* (大) in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version is written as *\"shèn\"* (甚).\n\n**My examination:** The *Guāngmíng* (广明), *Qìngyáng* (庆阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Nǎi juàn* (柰卷), *Shìcháng* (室町), *Gāo* (高), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), and *Fàn* (范) versions all match this stele.\nOnly the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions have the third sentence as *\"Guì mò cǎn yú yù dé\"* (咎莫憯于欲得), while the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) and *Gù Huān* (顾欢) versions write *\"dà\"* (大) as *\"shèn\"* (甚).\nThe *Hánshī wàizhuàn* (韩诗外传) *Jiǔ* (九) cites the first sentence *\"kě yù\"* (可欲) as *\"duō yù\"* (多欲), and *Wú Chéng* (吴澄)'s version places the third sentence above the second.\n\nThe *\"○\"* is a variant form of *\"jiù\"* (咎), identical to the ninth chapter.\n*Yú Yì* (俞樾) states: According to the *Héshàng* (河上) version, there is a sentence *\"The greatest crime is to desire what is not right\"* above this one, and based on the *Hánfēi zǐ* (韩非子) *Jiě Lǎo piān* (解老篇), this sentence should exist.\nHowever, *Hánfēi zǐ* (韩非子) mistakenly writes *\"huò mò dà yú kě yù\"* (祸莫大于可欲), which is incorrect.\nThe preceding text states:\n*\"He who harms the weak ruler above and oppresses the people below commits the greatest crime.\"*\nThus, it is clear that the original character was *\"zuì\"* (罪).」",

      "translated_text": "Liu Shipei says: *\"Yú’s account is correct. In the *Hánfēi zǐ* *Jiě Lǎo piān* (解老篇), the character ‘祸’ (huò) was mistakenly influenced by the preceding ‘君祸’ (jūn huò). Moreover, the *Yù Lǎo piān* (喻老篇) also cites these three phrases, correctly rendering them as ‘罪莫大于可欲’ (zuì mò dà yú kě yù). Given the preceding context—‘To name and title as crime, to give cities and lands as crime’—it is evident that the original *Lǎozi* text must have read ‘罪’ (zuì).*\n\nHowever, in both the *Jiě Lǎo* and *Yù Lǎo* chapters of the *Hánfēi zǐ*, the phrase appears as ‘咎莫大于欲得’ (jiù mò dà yú yù dé), where ‘大’ (dà) is uniformly rendered as ‘憯’ (cǎn). In the *Jiě Lǎo piān*, ‘得’ (dé) is further mistakenly written as ‘利’ (lì). The preceding passage in the *Jiě Lǎo piān* reads: ‘When bitter suffering mixes within the intestines, it harms the person—this is *憯* (cǎn), and *憯* leads one to retreat and blame oneself,’ thus explaining the meaning of ‘憯.’ Since ‘憯’ (cǎn) is synonymous with ‘痛’ (tòng), it may be glossed as ‘祸莫痛于欲得’ (huò mò tòng yú yù dé). The ancient *Lǎozi* text must originally have read ‘憯’ (cǎn), as did the *Fù* (傅) edition. The current text renders it as ‘大’ (dà), likely due to later scholars harmonizing it with the preceding ‘大’ (dà) character.\n\nAs for the *Jiě Lǎo piān*’s substitution of ‘利’ (lì) for ‘得’ (dé), this was an error influenced by the preceding ‘欲利’ (yù lì). Gu Qianli’s correction—retaining ‘得’ (dé)—is accurate.\n\nIn my notes: The rendering of ‘大’ (dà) as ‘憯’ (cǎn) is correct. ‘憯’ (cǎn) is interchangeable with ‘甚’ (shèn). The *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) editions read ‘甚’ (shèn), while the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) editions read ‘憯’ (cǎn). Fàn (范) explains: ‘憯 (cǎn) is pronounced like *cǎn* (惨), meaning *pain*.’ Bì Yàn (毕沅) states: ‘The *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) editions also render ‘憯’ (cǎn) as ‘大’ (dà), while *Hánfēi zǐ* reads ‘咎莫憯于欲利’ (jiù mò cǎn yú yù lì), and Lǐ Yuē (李约) renders ‘憯’ (cǎn) as ‘甚’ (shèn).

at one another, identical to *shǎn* (闪).”*\n\n*The Zì Lín* (字林) says:\n*“Kuī (窥): to lean one’s head inside a doorway and look; the character is also written as **○** (窺).”*\nRén Dà Chūn (任大椿) cites *Zì Lín* in his *Kǎo Yì* (考逸), quoting the *Mèng Yù* (孟郁) inscription on the *Yáo Miào* (尧庙) from the Han dynasty:\n*“**○** (窺) captures the essentials of the Dao.”*\nThus, it is clear that *kuī* (窥) and **○** (窺) are interchangeable.\n\nFurthermore, *“kuī”* (窥) in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) reads:\n*“Kuī (窥): to look stealthily, from *xué* (穴), with the sound of *guī* (规).”*\nThis aligns closely with the earlier definition of *kuī* (窥).\n\nIn the *Yì Guān* (易观):\n*“Kuī guān lì nǚ zhēn”* (窥观利女贞) uses *kuī* (窥),\nwhile in the *Fēng* (丰):\n*“Kuī qí hù”* (窥其户) also uses *kuī* (窥).\nThus, *kuī* (窥) should be employed here.\n\nThe *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) manuscript reads *“kuī”* (窥),\nmatching the *Hán Fēi* (韩非) passage *Yù Lǎo* (喻老),\nand this should be followed.\n\nXià Sù (夏竦) records the *Gǔwén Sì Shēng Yùn* (古文四声韵), where *“kuī”* (窥) appears,\nand cites the *Lìshān Mù Dàodé Jīng* (厉山木道德经) manuscript as **○** (窺).\nThe farther one’s search, the closer one’s understanding.\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均)

mistaken character for *“shǎo* (少)’”,\nwhich Fù’s (傅) and Fàn’s (范) editions correct to *“xiān* (鲜)’”.\nFàn (范) says:\n*“The character ‘xiān* (鲜)’ aligns with the ancient editions of *Hán Fēi* (韩非) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼).”*\nAdditionally, the *Hán Fēi* (韩非) passage *Yù Lǎo* (喻老),\n*Huái Nán* (淮南) *Dàoyīng Xuàn* (道应训) and *Jīngshén Xuàn* (精神训),\nas well as the *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋) *Jūn Shǒu* (君守) passage,\nall include *“zhě* (者)’” after *“yuǎn* (远)’”.\nThe *Huái Nán Jīngshén Xuàn* (淮南精神训) states:\n*“Hence it is said: the farther one’s search, the less one’s knowledge.”*\n(*“Thus, the spirit cannot be allowed to dissipate externally.”*)\nWáng Niǎnsūn (王念孙) notes:\n*“These twelve characters are a quotation from *Lǎozi* (老子) with an explanation;\nlater scholars mistakenly took them as commentary and thus inserted them into the notes.”*\n\nAgain, the *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋) *Xiān Jǐ* (先己) passage says:\n*“Without stepping outside the door or gate,\nyet the world is governed—\ncould this be because one knows only to reflect upon oneself?”*\n\nThe *Lùnrén* (论人) passage states:\n*“The highest sage reflects upon himself,\nthe next seeks in others.\nThe farther one’s search,\nthe more distant one’s application;\nThe more forcefully one seeks,\nthe farther one strays from the truth.”*\nThese are all variations of *Lǎozi*’s (老子) words.\n\nThe *Jūn Shǒu* (君守) passage reads:\n*“Hence it is said: ‘Not stepping outside the door while knowing the world,\nNot peering through the window while knowing the Dao of Heaven,\nThe farther one’s search, the less one’s knowledge.’”*\nThough it does not quote *Lǎozi* (老子) directly,\nit is evident that this is an interpretation of *Lǎozi*’s (老子) teachings.\n\nBì Yàn (毕沅) further notes:\n*“‘Xiān* (鲜)’ is the ancient form of ‘xiānshǎo* (鲜少)’,\nand all editions uniformly write ‘shǎo* (少)’.”\nMǎ Xùlún (马叙伦) states:\n*“This should read ‘shǎo* (少)’,\nas ‘xiān* (鲜)’ is a vulgarized character,\nand ‘shǎo* (少)’ rhymes with ‘dào* (道)’.”*\n\nThus, the sage does nothing yet knows,\ndoes not see yet names,\ndoes not act yet achieves.\n\nQián Zhī (谦之) notes:\n*“‘Not seeing yet naming* (不见而名)’”,\nin *Hán Fēi*’s (韩非) *Yù Lǎo* (喻老) and the editions of *Zhāng Suìchéng* (张嗣成) and *Wēi Dàyǒu* (危大有),\nall quote ‘*míng* (明)’ instead of ‘*míng* (名)’.\nWǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) argues:\n*“‘Míng* (名)’ is a phonetic loan for ‘*míng* (明)’.”*\nJiǎng Xíchāng (蒋锡昌) states:\n*“Though ‘*míng* (名)’ and ‘*míng* (明)’ were used interchangeably in antiquity,\n*Lǎozi* (老子) employs only ‘*míng* (明)’.\nIn Chapter 22: *“Not seeing oneself, hence *míng* (明)”*,\nand in Chapter 52: *“Seeing the small, hence *míng* (明)”*,\nboth use the paired terms ‘*jiàn* (见)’ and ‘*míng* (明)’.\nThis is further proof, and thus the character should be altered according to *Zhāng*’s (张) edition.”*\n\nNow, considering the *Shì Míng Shì Yán* (释名释言语):\n*“Míng (名): to make clear.”*\n*“Míng (名)” and *“míng (明)” share both sound and meaning,\nso there is no need to alter the character.\n\nAgain, *“bù wéi”* (不为),\nin *Héshàng* (河上) and *Yáo Mèngfǔ* (姚孟俯) editions,\nis written as *“wú wéi”* (无为).\nGiven the parallel structures *“bù xíng”* (不行) and *“bù jiàn”* (不见)\nin the preceding sentences, *“bù wéi”* (不为) is the correct form.\n\n---\n【Phonology and Rhyme】\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme readings for this chapter:\n*“Hù* (户), *xià* (下) rhyme (鱼部),\n*Yǒu* (牖), *dào* (道) rhyme (幽部).”*\n\nYáo Wéntián (姚文田) and Dèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) read:\n*“Zēng* (增), *míng* (名), *chéng* (成) rhyme.”*\n\nChén Zhù (陈柱) reads:\n*“Yǒu* (牖), *dào* (道), *shǎo* (少) rhyme,\n*míng*

Since the canonical text omits this sentence, it should be restored according to the **Héshànggōng** (河上公) edition.\n\nQián Zhī (谦之) notes:\nThe restoration as above is correct. All the **Wáng** (王) editions mistakenly omit this sentence, but the Daoist Canon **Wáng** (王) edition retains it.\n\nMoreover, *\"注\"* (zhu) means *\"to gather\"* (聚).

This passage says:\n*\"All the common people focus their ears and eyes upon it, and the **Sage** externally closes them\"* (百姓皆注其耳目，圣人皆阂之), meaning to externally block the common people’s ears and eyes, rendering them deaf and blind.\n\nThis is **Lǎozǐ**’s (老子) policy of keeping the people in simplicity. *\"孩\"* (hái), *\"咳\"* (kè), and *\"阂\"* (hé) are interchangeable as borrowed characters, hence also written as *\"骇\"* (hài) or *\"咳\"* (kè).

      "translated_text": "---\n**○** Without a place to lodge its horn, **Qiānzhī** confirms: *\"Yú\"* (兕), a beast’s name, is the female **rhinoceros**. The *Ěryǎ* states: *\"Its form resembles that of a wild cow, with a single horn weighing a thousand *jīn* (斤).\"* In the *Huáinánzǐ*’s *\"Dìxíng Trùn\"* (地形训), it reads: *\"In the southern lands, there are the rhinoceros and elephants of Liángshān.\"* High Yù (高诱) annotates: *\"Liángshān lies in Kuàijī (会稽). The rhinoceros horns and elephant tusks of Chángshā (长沙) and Xiāngnán (湘南) are all treasures.\"* The *Shānhǎijīng* (山海经) records: *\"The **yú** (兕) emerges from the southern banks of Xiāngshuǐ (湘水), with a blackish hue.\"* As **Lǎozǐ** (老子) was a **Chǔ** (楚) native, he used the **yú** as a metaphor. **\"Without a place to lodge its horn,\"** the **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render *\"tóu\"* (投) as *\"zhù\"* (驻). **Gù** (顾) annotates in his *Chéngshū* (成疏): *\"All editions say *‘zhù’* (驻), meaning *‘to stand’*.\"* Thus, this is what **Chéng** (成) observed in his original text. In the *Huáinánzǐ*’s *\"Quán Yán Trùn\"* (诠言训), it cites: *\"The tiger has no place to deploy its claws, the **yú** has no place to deploy its horn\"*—both rendered as *\"cuò\"* (措). Jiǎng Xíchāng (蒋锡昌) states: *\"‘Zhù’ (驻) likely shares the same pronunciation as ‘zhù’ (注).\"* In **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Dá Shēng\"* (达生), it reads: *\"He who strikes with a tile is skilled\"*—the *Shìwén* (释文) cites **Lǐ** (李) as saying: *\"‘Zhù’ (注) means ‘to strike’.\"* Both *\"zhù\"* (驻) and *\"zhù\"* (注) are phonetic variants of *\"tóu\"* (投). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines *\"tóu\"* (投) as *\"to thrust\"* (擿). **\"Without a place to lodge its horn\"** means that the adept at nurturing life, having avoided encountering the **yú**, thus the **yú** finds no place to thrust its horn. **Qiānzhī** confirms: Jiǎng’s explanation is correct. The *Yán Tiě Lún* (盐铁论) in *\"Shìwù Piān\"* (世务篇) renders it as **\"Without a place to use its horn\"**—*\"yòng\"* (用) also being a phonetic variant. **Lǎozǐ**’s *\"Bǎixìng jiē zhù qí ěrmù\"* (百姓皆注其耳目) uses *\"zhù\"* (注) in the sense of *\"use\"* (用).\n\n**○** Without a place to sheath its claws, weapons have no room to wield their blades. **Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *\"‘Sheath its claws’\"* is rendered as *\"cuò\"* (措) in **Gù** (顾)’s annotation, **Héshàng** (河上), and **Wáng Bì** (王弼)’s text, while the *Shìwén* (释文) uses *\"cuò\"* (错). **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) observes: The **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render *\"‘cuò’* (措) as *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"; the *Shìwén* (释文) edition aligns with this. **Qiānzhī** confirms: **Luǒ Juàn** (罗卷) renders *\"‘zhuǎ’* (爪) as *\"‘○’*\"* (○), an error. The *Bēiběn* (碑本) renders *\"‘cuò’* (措) as *\"‘kāi’* (揩)\"*, also incorrect. *\"‘Kāi’* (揩)\"* is a mistaken character for *\"‘cuò’* (措).\"* Both the *Hán Fēi Jiě Lǎo* (韩非解老) and *Shìwén* (释文), as well as the **Suìzhōu** (遂州) and **Fàn** (范) editions, render it as *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"; while the *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Fénxī* (磻溪), *Shìtáng* (室町), **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷), and **Fù Yì** (傅奕) editions all use *\"‘cuò’* (措)\"*.*\"‘Cuò’* (措) and *\"‘cuò’* (错)\"* were anciently interchangeable. *\"‘Cuò’* (措)\"* means *\"to place\"*—*\"without a place to sheath its claws\"* implies *\"without a place to rest its claws.\"* *\"‘Zhuǎ’* (爪)\"* in **Luǒ Juàn** (罗卷) is rendered as *\"‘○’*\"* (○), resembling *\"‘zhuā’* (抓)\"* in form. **Xià Shēn** (夏竦) in his *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* (古文四声韵) includes the character *\"‘zhuā’* (抓)\"*, citing the ancient *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text as *\"‘○’*\"* (○). Why so? It is because there is **no place of death**. **Liú Shīpèi** (刘师培) states: *\"In the *Hán Fēizǐ Jiě Lǎo* (韩非子解老篇), it reads: ‘Embodying the Dao of Heaven and Earth, it is said: *“Without a place of death.”*’ Thus, the character *\"‘yě’*\"* (也) in this passage is a corruption of *\"‘dì’*\"* (地). **Wáng** (王) explains it as *\"‘What place of death is there?’\"*—so **Wáng**’s (王) edition also renders it as *\"‘dì’*\"* (地). Now, the *Héshàng* (河上) edition uses *\"‘dì’*\"* (地), while **Wáng**’s (王) edition uses *\"‘yě’*\"* (也), likely due to scribal errors. **Qiānzhī** confirms: All **Wáng** (王) editions uniformly render it as *\"‘dì’*\"* (地), not *\"‘yě’*\"* (也); **Liú**’s (刘) source was an erroneous edition. Among all **Wáng** (王) editions, only the **Zhèjú** (浙局) edition, based on the **Huátíng Zhāng** (华亭张) original, renders it as *\"‘sǐ yě’*\"* (死也), which lacks meaning. All the *Shíběn* (石本) and *Shǐxiěběn* (写本) editions align with this *Shí* (石) text, except the **Suìzhōu** (遂州) edition, which renders *\"‘hé’*\"* (何) as *\"‘qí’*\"* (其). The **Fàn** (范) edition renders *\"‘gù’*\"* (故) as *\"‘zāi’*\"* (哉). The **Fù** (傅) and **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷) editions have *\"‘yě’*\"* (也) after *\"‘gù’*\"* (故), while the **Yán** (严) and **Shìtáng** (室町) editions use *\"‘zāi’*\"* (哉). The *Hán Fēi Jiě Lǎo* (韩非解老) and **Wáng Xīnzhī** (王羲之) editions, along with the **Fù** (傅) edition, include *\"‘yān’*\"* (焉) after *\"‘dì’*\"* (地)—this is an added character for rhetorical effect, unrelated to the core meaning. **Gāo Yán’dì** (高延第) states: This chapter instructs those navigating turbulent times that the **yú** and tiger, as well as weapons and blades, are all ominous and violent, metaphorically illustrating the treacherous paths of the world and the deceitful nature of human affairs. Reading **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Yǎngshēng Zhǔ\"* (养生主) and *\"Rénjiān Shì\"* (人间世) suffices to grasp the intent of this chapter—it does not truly advocate following a hungry tiger. The followers of **Gě Hóng** (葛洪) fail to understand this meaning, fabricating talismans and spells to ward off evil, claiming one can enter mountains and subdue spirits—utterly absurd.\n\n**[Yīnyùn]** This chapter lacks rhyme in **Jiāng**’s (江) pronunciation. **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) suggests: *\"‘sān’*\"* (三) rhymes with *\"‘sān’*\"* (三). **Qiānzhī** confirms: *\"‘Sān’*\"* (三) in ancient pronunciation was akin to *\"‘sēn’*\"* (森). The *\"Pí Biàn\"* (摽) of the *\"Shī\"* (诗) reads: *\"Its fruit is threefold (三), seeking my commoners (庶士), until now (今兮)\"*—harmonizing with the modern rhyme.

      "translated_text": "「Wu [Zhōu] said: *\"Sun\"* (日) is sometimes written as *\"say\"* (曰), an error in transmission.*」 The text follows the same pattern as Chapter 52, where *\"say\"* (曰) should be retained, and all editions of the **Wáng** (王) family, as well as the **Huáinán Dàoyīng** (淮南道应训) commentary, correctly render it as *\"say\"* (曰). The reading as *\"sun\"* (日) is erroneous.\n\n**Takuchi Yoshio** (武内义雄) argues that the *\"small\"* (小) in *\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明) is a corrupted form of *\"constant/everlasting\"* (常), citing Chapter 52’s *\"Knowing the constant is clarity\"* (知常曰明) as evidence. This interpretation is highly persuasive.\n\nYet, the **Huáinán Bīnglüè** (淮南兵略) states: *\"Seeing what people cannot see is called clarity\"* (见人之所不可见谓之明), making the reading *\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明) even more plausible.\n\nAgain, *\"Holding to the soft is strength\"* (守柔曰强) is rendered as *\"Using the soft is strength\"* (用柔曰强) in the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌) edition, and the **Róng** (荣) commentary in the **Qiáng** (强) edition also cites the text as *\"Using the soft is strength\"* (用柔曰强). This appears to be a mistake influenced by the *\"use\"* (用) in the following line.\n\n*\"Use its light\"* (用其光), *\"restore its clarity\"* (复归其明),\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: The **Huáinán Dàoyīng** (淮南道应训) commentary includes *\"Therefore\"* (是故) before these two lines, while **Móu Zǐ Lǐhuò** (牟子理惑论) cites three lines: *\"Use its light\"* (用其光), *\"restore its clarity\"* (复其明), *\"without leaving the body to calamity\"* (无遗身殃), omitting *\"its\"* (其) and *\"return\"* (归). Moreover, **Gāo Yè** (高翿) renders *\"restore its clarity\"* (复归其明) as *\"in clarity\"* (于明).\n\n*\"Without leaving the body to calamity\"* (无遗身殃) is called *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常).\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) says: *\"Adhere to the constant\"* (习常) is rendered as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) in the **Yùzhòng** (御注) and **Gāo Yè** (高翿) editions.\n**Takuchi Yoshio** (武内义雄) states: The **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) editions render it as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常), with *\"adhere\"* (习) and *\"assail\"* (袭) being homophones and interchangeable.\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: The **Jǐngfú** (景福), **Nài** (柰) editions, **Gùhuān** (顾欢), the **Zhū Héshàng** (诸河上) editions, and the **Wáng** (王) editions all render it as *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常). **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Lóu Zhèng** (楼正), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Yán** (严), **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), **Fàn** (范), **Wáng Xǔzhēn** (王羲之), and **Zhào Mèngfǔ** (赵孟俯) render it as *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常), with *\"assail\"* (袭) and *\"adhere\"* (习) being anciently interchangeable. The **Wénxuǎn** (文选) commentary by **Rèn Yànshēng** (任彦升) on *\"Shàngshū Jīnténg\"* (尚书金滕) states: *\"Adhere\"* (习) and *\"assail\"* (袭) are interchangeable, and *\"Cloth\"* (裳) is the ancient form of *\"constant\"* (常). The **Shūmíng** (释名) explains: *\"Cloth\"* (裳), *\"barrier\"* (障); it is what one uses to shield oneself.*」 The phrase *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) in this chapter shares the same meaning as *\"conceal the light\"* (袭明) in Chapter 27—both imply the **Daoist** practice of preserving and concealing one’s brilliance.\n\nThe **Yùpiàn** (玉篇) defines *\"assail\"* (袭): *\"Left-lapelled robe\"* (左衽袍), *\"to enter\"* (入), *\"layered garment\"* (重衣).*」 Its meaning aligns with layered garments shielding one’s brilliance. The **Yè Mèngdé** (叶梦得) edition correctly renders *\"adhere to the constant\"* (习常) as *\"cloth\"* (裳).\n\nHowever, in the **Lǎozǐ** (老子) text, *\"light\"* (光) and *\"clarity\"* (明) carry distinct meanings (as **Dàtián Qíngxuān** (大田晴轩) explains). In Chapter 16: *\"Returning to the **Way** is called the constant, knowing the constant is called clarity\"* (复命曰常，知常曰明); in Chapter 52: *\"Knowing harmony is called the constant, knowing the constant is called clarity\"* (知和曰常，知常曰明); in Chapter 33: *\"Knowing others is wisdom, self-knowing is clarity\"* (知人者智，自知者明); and in Chapter 22: *\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明), all instances of *\"clarity\"* (明) refer to **inner wisdom** (内在之智慧). In Chapter 58: *\"Light without dazzling\"* (光而不耀); in Chapters 4 and 52: *\"Harmonizing its light\"* (和其光); and in Chapter 24: *\"Using its light, returning to its clarity\"* (用其光，复归其明), all instances of *\"light\"* (光) refer to **outer expression** (外表之智慧).*」 This implies blending with the mundane, not dazzling, thus concealing one’s light—akin to **Zhuāngzǐ**’s *\"Qíwùlùn\"* (齐物论) *\"Bǎoguāng\"* (葆光), which is here termed *\"assail the cloth\"* (袭裳).\n\n*\"Seeing the small is clarity\"* (见小曰明) and *\"Not seeing oneself is clarity\"* (不自见故明) in Chapter 41, *\"The **Way** of clarity is like darkness\"* (明道若昧) in Chapter 41, all suggest concealing one’s clarity—*\"This is called subtle clarity\"* (是谓微明) in Chapter 36 and *\"This is called assailing clarity\"* (是谓袭明) in Chapter 27. Thus, *\"assail the constant\"* (袭常) and *\"assail the clarity\"* (袭明) seem similar yet differ in meaning.\n\n【**Phonology**】 Jiāng’s rhyme reading for this chapter: *shǐ* (始), *mǔ* (母), *mǔ* (母), *zǐ* (子), *mǔ* (母), *dài* (殆) (韵部 *zhī*), *mén* (门), *qín* (勤) (韵部 *wén*), *shì* (事), *jiù* (救) (韵部 *zhī* and *yōu*通韵, *shì*协*shǐ* 去声 *shòu*反), *míng* (明), *qiáng* (强), *guāng* (光), *míng* (明), *yāng* (殃), *cháng* (常) (韵部 *yáng*).\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: *\"Affairs\"* (事) belongs to the *zhī* (之) rhyme, *\"salvation\"* (救) to the *yōu* (幽) rhyme, with *zhī* (之) and *yōu* (幽) being interchangeable. **Xí Zòng** (奚侗) agrees. **Xí** (奚) states: *\"Mother\"* (母) is read as *\"each\"* (每). *\"Affairs\"* (事) and *\"salvation\"* (救) form a rhyme. The *\"Shìguānzǐ Shìbīng\"* (鹖冠子世兵篇) uses the *zhī* (之) rhyme with *\"game\"* (游), *\"post\"* (邮), following the same pattern.\n\n**Gù Yànwǔ** (顾炎武) in *\"Tángyùn zhèng\"* (唐韵正) Volume 14, under *\"Fifty-two, thick\"* (十五厚), notes: *\"Mother\"* (母) has an ancient pronunciation of *mǎn yǐ* (满以)反, as seen in this chapter of **Lǎozǐ** (老子) and *\"The nameless is the **beginning** of heaven and earth, the named is the **mother** of ten thousand things\"* (无名天地之始，有名万物之母). *\"Sudden as the sea, drifting as if without end\"* (忽兮若海，漂兮若无所止), *\"All people have their own ends, yet I alone am stubborn and coarse\"* (众人皆有以，而我独顽以鄙), *\"I alone differ from others, thus valuing the **mother**\"* (我独异于人而贵食母). *\"Standing alone yet unchanging, revolving yet without peril\"* (独立而不改，周行而不殆), *\"It can be the **mother** of all under heaven\"* (可以为天下母). *\"The **mother** of a state, which can endure long\"* (有国之母，可以长久). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) states: *\"Affairs\"* (事) and *\"salvation\"* (救) form a rhyme, with *\"affairs\"* (事) being *zhī* (之) rhyme, *qùshēng* (去声), and *\"salvation\"* (救) being *yōu* (幽) rhyme, *qùshēng* (去声). To consider them as rhyming despite differing rhyme groups is like the *\"Shīyī\"* (诗翼) rhyming *\"clothing\"* (俅) with *\"○\"* (基), *\"cow\"* (牛), and *\"mole\"* (鼒).\n\nThe **Jīnglóngbēi** (景龙碑) edition contains **72 characters**; the **Dūnhuáng** (敦煌), **Héshàng** (河上), and **Wáng** (王) editions match this; the **Fù** (傅) edition has **73 characters**; the **Fàn** (范) edition has **72 characters**.

Renxun notes that both scholars take *\"shī\"* (施) to mean *\"deeds\"* (施為), which is incorrect. *\"Shī\"* (施) should be read as *\"yí\"* (迤), meaning *\"crooked.\"* Walking the Great Dao, one fears only straying into crooked paths.\n\nLater, it states: *\"The Great Dao is most smooth, yet people prefer byways\"* (大道甚夷，而民好径).

Crooked paths easily mislead people, hence \"I fear only the crooked.\" Wang Bi’s note says: \"The Great Dao is vast and straight, yet people still abandon it, preferring crooked byways—how much more so when deeds obstruct the Great Dao’s path!\" This adds an extra layer of meaning beyond the text, which is incorrect.)*\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (說文解字) defines *\"yí\"* (迤) as *\"crooked movement,\"* citing the *Yǔgōng* (禹貢): *\"Eastward it curves northward, converging at Huì.\"* In the *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) *Líliú* (離娄) chapter, *\"Shī from the virtuous man’s path\"* (施從良人之所之), Zhao’s (趙) note says: *\"Shī means to stray crookedly.\"*\n\nDing Gong (丁公) pronounces it *\"yí\"* (迤). In the *Huáinánzǐ* (淮南子) *Qísú* (齊俗) chapter: *\"Abandoning vice is not merely rejecting crooked paths\"* (去非者，非批邪施也), Gao’s (高) note says: *\"Shī means slight deviation.\"* In the *Yàoliào* (要略) chapter: *\"Meeting straight and crooked paths\"* (接径直施), Gao’s note says: *\"Shī means crooked.\"*\n\nThis proves *\"shī\"* (施) and *\"yí\"* (迤) are interchangeable.

In the *Xúnzǐ Róngrǔ*: *\"Is it not boastful?\"* (岂不迂乎哉), with the annotation: *\"Boastful\"* (迂) *\"means corrupt\"* (失). The meanings of *\"corrupt\"* (失) and *\"hollow\"* (虚) are interrelated.\n\nThe *Hànshū Wǔxíng Zhì* records *\"Shū Yú, Jì Fá\"* (叔迂季伐), annotated as *\"Boastful\"* (迂) *\"means boastful and hollow\"* (夸诞). The passage above—*\"The morning’s affairs were excessively corrupt\"* (朝甚除), *\"fields lay overgrown\"* (田甚芜), *\"granaries were empty\"* (仓甚虚), *\"adorned in fine silks, girded with sharp blades, gluttonous in drink and food, yet wealth overflowed\"* (服文彩，带利剑，厌饮食，财货有余)—all describe boastful excess. The context above and below aligns seamlessly.\n\nThe phrases *\"boastful and hollow\"* (诞夸) and *\"boastful and corrupt\"* (诞迂) were ancient colloquialisms, also rendered as *\"boastful excess\"* (夸诞) or *\"corrupt boastfulness\"* (迂诞). The *Xúnzǐ Bùgǒu* states: *\"Boastful excess breeds confusion\"* (夸诞生惑). The *Rúxiào* declares: *\"Boastful excess is hollow\"* (夸诞则虚). The *Bàopǔzǐ Qiàohuò* observes: *\"Superficial minds are prone to boastful excess\"* (浅薄之徒，率多夸诞). The *Shǐjì Xiàowǔ Běnjì* records: *\"Matters were as boastful and corrupt\"* (事如迂诞). The *Hànshū Yìwén Zhì* notes: *\"Then boastful, deceitful, and fantastical texts proliferated further\"* (则诞欺怪迂之文，弥以益多). All usages align.\n\nIf *\"robber\"* (盗) is read literally, the phrase *\"robber-boastful\"* (盗夸) becomes inscrutable. **Qián Zhēn** concludes: *\"It must be read as ‘robber-○’* (盗○). The *Jiǎwén Sìshēng Yùn* cites *Gǔ Lǎozǐ* with *\"boastful\"* (夸), matching the stele text. The *Yùzhù*, *Zhào Mèngfǔ* edition, and *Fàn* edition concur. The *Fàn* edition renders it as *\"○\"*, likely conflating with *\"○\"* (the character). The *Shuōwén Jiězì* defines *\"○\"* as *\"that which startles\"* (所以惊人也), composed of *\"dà\"* (大) and *\"○\"*. Alternatively: *\"Vulgar speech calls relentless theft ‘○’, pronounced like *hú* (瓠).\"*\n\n**Phonology:** Jiang Shì’s rhyme reading lacks a rhyme. **Yáo Wéntián** groups *\"除、芜、虚、余、竽\"* (twelve *Yú* level tone). **Dèng Tíngzhēn** and **Xí Dòng** follow. *\"竽\"* is read as *\"夸\"*. **Gāo Běn Hàn** groups *\"除、芜、虚、余、竽\"* (alternately *\"夸\"*) with *\"cǎi\"* (采), *\"shí\"* (食), *\"zāi\"* (哉) as rhyming. **Takuchi Yoshio** rhymes *\"wèi\"* (畏), *\"yí\"* (夷), *\"jìng\"* (径). **Qián Zhēn** notes: *\"‘畏’ and ‘夷’ belong to the *zhǐ* department; ‘径’ does not rhyme.\"* Jiang Yǒng’s *Gǔyùn Biāozhǔn* (Vol. 19, *Má* section) cites *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"The morning’s affairs were excessively corrupt\"* (朝甚除) to *\"This is called ‘robber-boastful’\"* (是谓盗夸). The *Jǐnglóng* stele text (52 characters), *Dūnhuáng*, *Wáng*, and *Fàn* editions agree. The *Héshàng* edition has 51 characters; the *Fù* edition, 54. The *Héshàng* edition is titled *\"Yìzhèng Dìsānshísān\"* (益证第五十三), the *Wáng* edition *\"Dìsānshísān Zhāng\"* (五十三章), and the *Fàn* edition *\"Shǐwǒ Jièrán Zhāng Dìsānshísān\"* (使我介然章第五十三).\n\n**Chapter 54:**\n*\"The well-built stands unshaken; the well-embraced is not cast off.

Additionally, the *Húnnán Zhǔshù Xuányìn*’s *\"Lún\"* section cites the first sentence identically to this stele text.\n\nThe *Huánnán Zhǔshù Xuányìn* annotates *\"The well-built stands unshaken\"* (善建者不拔) as *\"Speaking of the formless nature of building\"* (言建之无形也). **Wáng Niǎnsūn** states: *\"These six characters are the main text, not annotation. ‘Thus, the well-built stands unshaken’* (故善建者不拔) quotes *Lǎozǐ*, while ‘Speaking of the formless nature of building’* (言建之无形也) elucidates its meaning. The *Wénzǐ* correctly renders it: ‘Thus, the well-built stands unshaken, speaking of the formless nature of building’\"* (故善建者不拔，言建之无形也). This aligns with *Lǎozǐ*’s ancient intent. **Hán Fēizǐ**’s *Yùlǎo* cites *\"The well-built stands unshaken, the well-embraced is not cast off, descendants with their sacrifices never cease\"* (善建不拔，善抱不脱，子孙以其祭祀世世不辍), where **Gù Guǎngqì** notes: *\"The *Déjīng* lacks the four characters ‘yǐqí shìshì’* (以其世世).\"* Again, the *Jiělǎo* quotes *\"unshaken\"* (不拔), *\"not cast off\"* (不脱), *\"sacrifices unbroken\"* (祭祀不绝), showing *\"cease\"* (辍) is also written *\"absolute\"* (绝), with identical meanings. **Takuchi Toshio**’s *Dùn* edition renders *\"zhé\"* (辍) as *\"zuì\"* (醊); **Luó Juàn** as *\"chuò\"* (啜)—both incorrect.\n\n*\"Cultivate the self, and virtue becomes genuine;\nCultivate the family, and virtue overflows.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「【Phonology & Rhyme】 In this chapter, **Jiāng Shì**’s rhyme readings are as follows:\n- *bá*, *tuō*, *chuò* (rhyming under the *Jì* [祭] department, with *bá* pronounced as *biè*, *tuō* and *tā guì* [他厥] in reverse).\n- *shēn*, *zhēn* (rhyming under the *Zhēn* [真] department),\n- *jiā*, *yú* (rhyming under the *Yú* [鱼] department, with *jiā* pronounced as *gū*),\n- *xiāng*, *zhǎng* (rhyming under the *Yáng* [阳] department),\n- *bāng*, *fēng* (rhyming under the *Dōng* [东] department, with *bāng* pronounced as *bó gōng* [博工] in reverse; originally *\"xiū zhī guó\"* [修之国], now altered to match the citation in *Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo* [解老]).\n\n- *xià*, *pǔ* (rhyming under the *Yú* [鱼] department).\n\n**Dèng Tíngzhēn** remarks: *\"Bá, tuō, chuò\"* rhyme under the *Jì* department—*\"Jì\"* is its **入聲** [rùshēng, entering tone].\n\n**Gù Guǎngqì**’s *Tángyùn zhèng sì* [唐韵正四] by **Jiāng Yǒng** states: *\"Bāng\"* [邦], in ancient pronunciation, rhymes as *bó gōng* [博工].\n\nCiting *Lǎozǐ* [老子]:\n- *\"Xiū zhī bāng, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之邦，其德乃丰].\n- Again, under the *Jiǔ Má* [九麻] rhyme: *\"Jiā\"* [家], in ancient pronunciation, rhymes as *gū* [姑], citing *Lǎozǐ*:\n- *\"Xiū zhī jiā, qí dé nǎi yú\"* [修之家，其德乃余].\n\n**Máo Qílíng**’s *Gǔjīn tōngyùn* [古今通韵] states: It was previously suspected that *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"Xiū zhī yú xiāng, qí dé nǎi zhǎng; xiū zhī yú guó, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之于乡，其德乃长；修之于国，其德乃丰] should have *fēng* [丰] and *xiāng* [乡] rhyming together, as they belong to the *Dōng* [东] and *Yáng* [阳] departments’ shared rhyme. Having now confirmed the rhyme schemes of *Yì Lín* [易林]’s *\"gōng\"* [功] and *\"guó\"* [国], it is clear that *xiāng* [乡], *zhǎng* [长], *fēng* [丰], and *guó* [国] each follow their own rhyme scheme—this is the **轆轳押法** [lùluó yāfǎ, alternating rhyme technique], yet I still hesitate to fully accept this.\n\nUpon examining **Cháng Wǔ**’s poetry, it is evident that *\"fù\"* [父] rhymes with *\"shì\"* [士], and *\"guó\"* [国] rhymes with *\"wǒ\"* [我], a vast and resonant correspondence. Indeed, *\"guó\"* [国] belongs to the *Zhí* [职] department, functioning as an **入聲** [rùshēng, entering tone] counterpart to *\"zhēng\"* [蒸]. Since *Dōng* [东] and *Zhēng* [蒸] originally shared the same rhyme, this explains their rhyming usage. Thus, rhyme schemes do follow discernible patterns and are not entirely arbitrary (Volume One).\n\n**Qiānzhī** observes: **Máo’s** explanation is incorrect. **Chái Shàobǐng**’s *Gǔyùn tōngjuàn* [古韵通卷] under the *Dōng* [东] department and its related rhymes also cites *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"guó\"* [国] as pronounced *\"gōng\"* [公], a mistake identical to **Máo’s**.\n\nIndeed, none of them recognize that *\"guó\"* [国] in modern usage was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦], altered due to **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳]—*Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo* [解老] clearly attests to *\"bāng\"* [邦].\n\n**Jiāng Yǒng**’s *Gǔyùn biāozhǔn rùshēng* [古韵标准入声] under the **sixth department** states: In *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"Xiū zhī yú bāng, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之于邦，其德乃丰], variant texts render *\"bāng\"* [邦] as *\"guó\"* [国], likely another instance of **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] alteration. In *Yì Lín* [易林], *\"hòujì nóng gōng, fù lì wǒ guó\"* [后稷农功，富利我国], *\"guó\"* [国] is also the original *\"bāng\"* [邦]. Modern rhyme books incorrectly cite this rhyme as *\"guó\"* [国] with *gōng hóng* [公红] tone, a grave error.\n\n**Kǒng Guǎngsēn**’s *Shīshēng lèi* [诗声类] (Volume Four) states:\nExamining *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字]: *\"Bāng\"* [邦], composed of *\"yì\"* [邑] and the phonetic *\"fēng\"* [丰].\n*Shìmíng* [释名] explains: *\"Bāng\"* [邦], meaning **\"to enfeoff\"** [封], for enfeoffing meritorious service.\nThus, *\"bāng\"* [邦] is clearly pronounced as *\"fēng\"* [封].\n\nIn *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"Xiū zhī yú guó, qí dé nǎi fēng\"* [修之于国，其德乃丰], *Hán Fēizǐ*’s *Jiělǎo* [解老] cites it as *\"xiū zhī bāng\"* [修之邦], hence its rhyme with *\"fēng\"* [丰]. Modern editions follow the **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] of *\"Gāo Dì\"* [高帝] by altering it to *\"guó\"* [国].\n\n**Máo’s** *Gǔjīn tōngyùn* [古今通韵] mistakenly claims *\"guó\"* [国] has a *\"gōng\"* [工] pronunciation, revealing such a profound misinterpretation that other convoluted theories are hardly worth refuting!\n\n**Jiāng Yǒu** [Jiāng Yǒu] states: The **Hán Dynasty** [汉] often altered texts to avoid taboo words. For instance, in *Lǎozǐ*’s *\"xiū zhī bāng\"* [修之邦], *\"bāng\"* [邦] was changed to *\"guó\"* [国] to avoid the **Emperor Gāozu** [高祖] taboo. In *Shǐjì* [史记], every instance of *\"qǐ\"* [启] was changed to *\"kāi\"* [开], avoiding the **Emperor Jǐng** [景帝] taboo. Thus, discrepancies in ancient rhymes may not always be errors but rather **Hán Dynasty taboo** [避讳] alterations (General Overview of Ancient Rhymes).\n\n**Lǐ Qìnyún** [李赓芸] states: In the *Déjīng* [德经] of *Lǎozǐ* [老子], *\"Xiū zhī yú shēn, qí dé nǎi zhēn\"* [修之于身，其德乃真], these eight lines alternate in four rhyme schemes. *\"Guó\"* [国] was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦], rhyming with *\"fēng\"* [丰]. Additionally, in *Guǎnzǐ*’s *Mùmín* [牧民] chapter:\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng shēng, yuǎn zhě bù tīng\"* [毋曰不同生，远者不听],\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng xiāng, yuǎn zhě bù xíng\"* [毋曰不同乡，远者不行],\n- *\"Wú yuē bùtóng guó, yuǎn zhě bù cóng\"* [毋曰不同国，远者不从].\n*\"Guó\"* [国] is also the original *\"bāng\"* [邦], rhyming with *\"cóng\"* [从].\n\nThe **Hán Dynasty** [汉] altered *\"bāng\"* [邦] to *\"guó\"* [国] to avoid the **Emperor Gāozǔ** [高祖] taboo, and later generations, unaware of this correction, perpetuated the change until today.\n\n**Dèng Tíngzhēn** [邓廷桢] states: *\"Guó\"* [国] was originally *\"bāng\"* [邦]. The correct reading is *\"bāng\"* [邦], as *\"bāng\"* [邦] means **\"to enfeoff\"** [封]. The *Shū Xù* [书序] states: *\"Bāng Kāngzǔ, bāng zhūhóu\"* [邦康叔，邦诸侯], meaning **\"enfeoffing Kāngzǔ, enfeoffing the lords\"** [封康叔，封诸侯]. The *Lúnyǔ* [论语] says: *\"Qiě zài bāng yù zhī zhōng yǐ\"* [且在邦域之中矣], where *\"bāng yù\"* [邦域] refers to **\"enfeoffed territory\"** [封域]. Ancient pronunciation grouped *Dōng* [东], *Dōng* [冬], *Zhōng* [锺], and *Jiāng* [江] under the same department, with *\"bāng\"* [邦] pronounced as *\"bó gōng\"* [博工], precisely rhyming with *\"fēng\"* [丰] in this passage.\n\n---\nRegarding the manuscript variations:\n- The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] inscription has **87 characters**.\n- The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] manuscript has **84 characters** (character count follows **Wǔ Nèi** [武内], while **Luó Juàn** [罗卷] does not record this).\n- The *Hé Shàng* [河上] edition has **90 characters**.\n- **Wáng Bì**’s [王弼] edition has **91 characters**.\n- **Fù**’s and **Fàn**’s [傅、范] editions have **86 characters**.\n\n- The *Hé Shàng* [河上] edition titles this as *\"Xiū Guān dì wǔshísì\"* [修观第五十四].\n- **Wáng Bì**’s [王弼] edition titles this as *\"Wǔshísì zhāng\"* [五十四章].\n- **Fàn**’s [范] edition titles this as *\"Shàn Jiànzhě bù bá zhāng dì wǔshísì\"* [善建者不拔章第五十四], now recognized as the **54th Chapter** [五十四章].",

      "translated_text": "「Wáng Zhù [王注] states: *\"○, meaning 'long' [长], as there is nothing to harm its body, hence it can attain fullness and growth [全长].\"*\n\nThis interpretation is highly questionable. The *Héshàng* [河上] version reads *\"○\"* for *\"全\"*, yet its annotation states: *\"The red child [赤子] does not yet know the union of male and female [男女之合会], and when the yin [阴] arises in anger, it is due to the abundance of vital essence and qi [精气多之所致].\"* Thus, *\"○\"* is explained through the character *\"阴\"*.\n\nThe *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] under the \"flesh\" radical [肉部] says: *\"○, the red child’s yin [赤子阴].\"* *\"○\"* is indeed *\"朘\"* [朘]. It is suspected that the original text Wáng Zhù [王注] relied upon had *\"全\"* [全] as a mistake for *\"○\"* [○]. *\"○\"* is the genuine character for *\"阴\"* [阴]...\n\nIn the ancient *Lǎozǐ* [老子] manuscripts, *\"○\"* [○] likely follows the old script form, while the clerical script sometimes renders it as *\"○\"* [○]. The *Wǔliángcí* [武梁祠] inscriptions, where the character *\"阴\"* [阴] is depicted with a left side of *\"○\"* [○], confirms this. When *\"○\"* [○] is worn or damaged, only its upper half remains, making it resemble *\"全\"* [全], hence the confusion.\n\nThus, the reading *\"○\"* [○] reflects the original *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text, *\"全\"* [全] is an erroneous substitution for *\"○\"* [○], and *\"○\"* [○] is a variant form. Wáng Zhù [王注] based his annotation on the mistaken reading and failed to correct it, thereby obscuring the original *Lǎozǐ* [老子] text—this is regrettable.\n\nYì Shùndìng [易顺鼎] says: According to the *Shìwén* [释文], *\"The Héshàng* [河上] version also reads *‘脧’* [脧].\"* It further cites the *Shuōwén* [说文]: *\"脧, the red child’s yin [赤子阴].\"* However, the *Shuōwén* [说文] does not contain the character *\"脧\"* [脧], suggesting that the Tang-era [唐本] version included it. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] also states *\"脧, the red child’s yin [赤子阴]\"*, aligning with the original meaning of the *Shuōwén* [说文]. This implies that the *Shuōwén* [说文] collected *\"朘\"* [朘] as derived from *Lǎozǐ* [老子]. Since *\"朘\"* [朘] and *\"全\"* [全] have similar pronunciations, *\"全\"* was sometimes borrowed as a substitute.\n\nWáng Zhù’s [王注] error lies in interpreting the character based solely on its appearance, unaware that *\"全\"* [全] was a borrowed form for *\"朘\"* [朘].\n\nHóng Yìxiàn [洪颐烜] states: The *Shuōwén* [说文] does not include *\"朘\"* [朘]. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] says: *\"朘, the red child’s yin [赤子阴]. Also written as ○ [○], and in some phonetic categories as ○ [○].\"* The *Shuōwén* [说文] also lacks *\"○\"* [○], which is likely a corrupted form of *\"○\"* [○]. The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"○\"* [○] as: *\"A covering, resembling skin wrapped around, with two arms beneath, and the character *夕* [夕] at the bottom, pronounced like *Fàn* [范].\"* In the *Suìwén Liù Jié Zàngxiàng Lùn* [素问六节藏象论], it states: *\"All marrow [髓] belongs to the brain [脑]\"*, which aligns with the following *\"The utmost of vital essence [精之至].\"* This meaning is also consistent.\n\nZhāng Bǐnglín [章炳麟] says: In *Lǎozǐ* [老子], *\"Before knowing the union of male and female, the red child’s yin [○] arises\"*, and the *Shìwén* [释文] states: *\"○, the red child’s yin [赤子阴], pronounced *zǐchuí* [子垂].\"* The *Sānjiā* [三州] (likely referring to the *Lǐngwài Sānjiā* [岭外三州]) defines the red child’s yin as *\"○\"* [○]. The child cries all day without its voice faltering, reaching the utmost harmony [和之至].\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] notes: *\"Cries all day without its voice faltering\"* [号而不嗄]—Yán Kějūn [严可均] says: *\"Gāo Dì [高翿] has the character *‘嗌’* [嗌] beneath *‘而’* [而].\"* The versions of Yán [严], Péng [彭], Fù [傅], Fàn [范], Wáng Xīzhī [王羲之], Zhào Mèngfǔ [赵孟俯], and *Pánxī* [磻溪] all include *\"嗌\"* [嗌]. *\"号\"* [号] is written as *\"嗥\"* [嗥] by Yán [严]. *\"嗄\"* [嗄] is rendered as *\"哑\"* [哑] in the *Héshàng* [河上] and *Nàijuàn* [柰卷] versions, *\"○\"* [○] by Fù [傅], and *\"嚘\"* [嚘] by Yán [严].\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子]’s *Gēngsāng Cǔ* [庚桑楚] section states: *\"The child cries all day without its voice faltering [儿子终日嗥而嗌不嗄], reaching the utmost harmony [和之至].\"* The *Shìwén* [释文] says: *\"‘嗥’* [嗥] is also written as *‘号’* [号]. ‘嗄’* [嗄] is also written as *‘嚘’* [嚘].\"* The ancient manuscript versions correctly read *\"儿子终日号而嗌不嚘\"* [儿子终日号而嗌不嚘], likely derived from *Lǎozǐ* [老子]. *\"嗌\"* [嗌] is a Qin [秦] and Jin [晋] dialect term, and Lǐ Yì [李颐] says: *\"‘嗌’* [嗌] is pronounced *è* [厄], meaning ‘to choke’ [噎].\"* Yáng Xiōng’s [扬雄] *Fāngyán* [方言] states: *\"‘厮’* [厮] (pronounced *sī* [斯]) and *‘嗌’* [嗌] (pronounced *è* [恶介]), both mean ‘to choke’ [噎] (all referring to throat pain, pronounced *yè* [翳]). The Chu [楚] say *‘嘶’* [嘶], while Qin [秦] and Jin [晋] sometimes say *‘嗌’* [嗌], or *‘噎’* [噎].\"* Since *Lǎozǐ* [老子] was a Chu [楚] person, he should use Chu [楚] language.\n\nChéng Xuànyīng’s [成玄英] annotation says: *\"The red child cries all day without its voice faltering [终日啼号而声不嘶嗄], as it lacks a mind to alter its sound, and its harmonious qi [和气] does not disperse.\"*\n\nThe text of the version Chéng Xuànyīng [成玄英] saw likely reads *\"终日号而嘶不嗄\"* [终日号而嘶不嗄]. Péng Dì’s [彭耜] *Shìwén* [释文] states: *\"‘嗌’* [嗌] means ‘throat’ [咽]. Huáng Máocái [黄茂材] says: ‘The ancient versions lack the character *‘嗌’* [嗌]. The phrase *‘嗌不嗄’* [嗌不嗄] is from *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], and later people added it to *Lǎozǐ*’s [老子] text, which is not adopted today.’\"* Additionally, *\"嗄\"* [嗄] is also written as *\"噫\"* [噫] or *\"哑\"* [哑]. Lù Démíng [陆德明] says: *\"‘而声不嗄’* [而声不嗄] should be read as *‘噫’* [噫].\"* The *Dàozàng* [道藏]’s *Zhāng Tàishǒu* [张太守]’s collection of four commentaries states: *\"The *Bì* [弼] version reads *‘噫’* [噫].\"* It further cites *Bì* [弼] as saying: *\"Without the mind of contention and desire [无争欲之心], hence it cries all day without faltering [不噫].\"*\n\nThis indicates that Wáng Zhù’s [王注] original text read *\"噫\"* [噫]. *\"噫\"* [噫], *\"yì\"* [欭], *\"yē\"* [噎], and *\"嚘\"* [嚘] are all variations of the same sound. Yán’s [严] version reads *\"嚘\"* [嚘], aligning with *\"终日号而不嚘\"* [终日号而不嚘], as noted in the *Yùpiàn* [玉篇]. The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"嚘\"* [嚘] as *\"the appearance of an undecided speech.\"* Yáng Xiōng’s [扬雄] *Tàixuàn Yí* [太玄夷] states: *\"The third softness in sequence: the infant’s cry, for three days without faltering [婴儿于号，三日不嚘].

      "original_text": "「噎」有忧义。 刘端临经传小记曰：「噎，忧也。 诗『中心如噎』，传曰：『噎忧不能息也。 』噎忧双声字。 玉篇引『诗「中心如噎」，谓噎忧不能息也』，增一『谓』字，最得毛氏之意。 『噎忧』即『欭嚘』，气逆也。 说文『欭』字注：『忧也。 』玉篇『嚘』字注：『老子曰：「终日号而不嚘。 」嚘，气逆也，亦作○。 』广韵：『欭，忧叹也。 』『○，气逆也。 』噎、噫、欭、忧一声之转。 」案端临所见，王念孙方言疏证补（高邮王氏遗书本第三册）引之，谓「实贯通毛传、方言之旨」是也。 今据以订正老子，知「号而嘶不嗄」，「嗄」是故书，其演变为「嚘」，为「○」，因又转为「噫」，为「哑」，盖皆方言之变耳。 易顺鼎曰：「按庄子庚桑楚篇云『终日号而嗌不嗄』，正本老子之文，较之太玄、玉篇更为近古可据。 『嗄』即史记刺客传『舌炭为哑』之『哑』，索隐谓：『哑，喑病也。 』此章以螫、据、搏、固、作、嗄为韵，皆古音同部字，若作『嚘』则无韵矣。 释文：『嗄，一迈反，又于介反。 』音并非。 」章炳麟曰：「司马彪曰：『楚人谓极无声曰嗄。 』今通谓不能言者为『嗄』，极无声亦曰『嗄』，通借『哑』字为之。 『哑』本训笑，易言『笑言哑哑』，然史记刺客列传已云『吞为哑』，其假借久矣。 」（新方言四）据此知「哑」为假借字，本字实为「嗄」。 「嗄」「哑」同字，故河上、柰卷作「哑」，然「哑」为后起之字，欲复老子古本之真，则宜从碑本作「嗄」，作「嚘」、作「○」、作「噫」、作「哑」皆非也。 知和曰常，知常曰明，益生曰祥，心使气曰强。 严可均曰：「知常曰明」，河上作「日明」，下二句皆然。 武内义雄曰：「益生曰祥」之「祥」字，罗振玉所藏敦煌本作「详」。 案「祥」为「牂」之假借，与「壮」同义，与下「物壮则老」之「壮」字相应。 谦之案：罗考异未及此。 校罗卷确为「详」字，与遂州本同，罗失校。 遂本无「知常曰明」句。 「曰」字，景福、柰卷作「日」，下三句皆然； 室町本下三句作「日」，首句作「曰」。 「强」字，楼正、武内敦本作「强」，傅奕「曰强」作「则强」。 又「益生曰祥」，李道纯作「益生不祥」。 道德会元序例云：「『益生不祥』，或云『日祥』，或云『曰祥』，皆非也。 」李本据河上丈人章句白本，理长。 庄子德充符篇：「常因自然而不益生。 」盖益生则老子所谓「生生之厚」，反于自然而动之，不祥是也。 「不祥」二字，经文三见：三十一章「夫佳兵者不祥之器」，「兵者不祥之器」，七十八章「受国不祥」。 惟此独作「祥」字，似有可疑。 盖祥有妖祥之义。 李奇曰：「内妖曰眚，外妖曰祥。 」玉篇：「祥，妖怪也。 」是祥即不祥。 道德经取善集引孙登曰：「生生之厚，动之妖祥。 」是也。 「曰祥」，说亦通。 易顺鼎曰：按祥即不祥。 书序云「有祥桑谷共生于朝」，与此「祥」字同义。 王注曰：「生不可益，益之则夭。 」「夭」字当为「妖」，盖以「妖」解「祥」字。 谦之案：道藏张太守汇刻四家注引王弼正作「妖」。 马叙伦曰：河上注曰：「人能知道之常行，则日以明达于玄妙也。 」是河上亦作「日明」。",
      "translated_text": "The character *\"噎\"* [yē] carries the meaning of *\"worry.\"*\n\nLiu Duānlín’s [刘端临] *Jīngchuán Xiǎojì* [经传小记] states:\n*\"噎\"* [yē] means *\"worry.\"* In the *Shī* [诗], *\"Centered like noise\"* [中心如噎], the *Zhuàn* [传] says: *\"Noise—worry that cannot be stilled.\"* *\"噎\"* [yē] and *\"忧\"* [yōu] are rhyming words. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] cites *\"The Shī: ‘Centered like noise,’ meaning noise—worry that cannot be stilled,\"* adding the word *\"meaning\"* [谓], most accurately capturing Máo Qí’s [毛奇] intent. *\"噎忧\"* [yēyōu] is the same as *\"欭嚘\"* [yìngōng], meaning *\"reversed qi.\"* The *Shuōwén* [说文] defines *\"欭\"* [yì] as *\"worry.\"* The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] annotates *\"嚘\"* [gōng] as: *\"Lǎozǐ [老子] says: ‘All day crying yet not 嚘.’ 嚘 means reversed qi, also written as ○.\"* The *Guǎngyùn* [广韵] states: *\"欭 [yì], sighing in worry. ○, reversed qi.\"* *\"噎\"* [yē], *\"噫\"* [yī], *\"欭\"* [yì], and *\"忧\"* [yōu] are variations of the same sound.\n\nBy examining Liu’s observations, Wáng Niǎnsūn’s [王念孙] *Fāngyán Shūzhèng Bǔ* [方言疏证补] (from the *Gāoyóu Wángshì Yíshū* [高邮王氏遗书], Vol. 3) cites it, declaring: *\"This truly unifies the intent of Máo’s commentary and dialectal usage.\"* Now, based on this, we correct *Lǎozǐ* [老子], knowing that *\"号而嘶不嗄\"* [háo ér sī bù shà] should have *\"嗄\"* [shà] as the original text, which later evolved into *\"嚘\"* [gōng], then *\"○\"* [yī], and further transformed into *\"噫\"* [yī], and finally *\"哑\"* [yǎ]—all being dialectal variations.\n\nYì Shùndǐng [易顺鼎] says:\n*\"According to *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], *Gēngsāng Cǔ* [庚桑楚], it states: ‘All day crying yet not 嗌 [shà] not 嗄 [shà].’ This is the original text of *Lǎozǐ* [老子], closer to antiquity than *Tàixuàn* [太玄] or *Yùpiàn* [玉篇]. 嗄 [shà] is the same as the ‘charcoal tongue made mute’ [舌炭为哑] in *Shǐjì* [史记], *Cìkè Zhuan* [刺客传]. The *Suǒyǐn* [索隐] states: ‘哑 [yǎ], a speech impediment.’ This chapter rhymes with 螫 [shì], 据 [jù], 搏 [bó], 固 [gù], 作 [zuò], 嗄 [shà], all ancient phonetic rhymes. If written as 嚘 [gōng], there would be no rhyme. The *Shìwén Jiězhu* [释文] states: ‘嗄 [shà], one reads as *mài* [迈], another as *yújiè* [于介].’ The pronunciation is incorrect.\"*\n\nZhāng Bǐnglín [章炳麟] says:\n*\"Sīmǎ Biāo [司马彪] states: ‘The Chu [楚] term for utter silence is 嗄 [shà].’ Today, 嗄 [shà] commonly refers to those unable to speak, and utter silence is also called 嗄 [shà], often borrowed as 哑 [yǎ]. 哑 [yǎ] originally means ‘laughter,’ as in *Yì* [易]: ‘Laughing speech, 哑哑 [yǎyǎ].’ Yet, the *Shǐjì* [史记], *Cìkè Lièzhuan* [刺客列传], already uses ‘swallowed into mute’ [吞为哑], showing its long-standing usage as a borrowed character.\"* (*Xīn Fāngyán* [新方言], Vol. 4)\n\nFrom this, we know *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is a borrowed character, with *\"嗄\"* [shà] as the original. *\"嗄\"* [shà] and *\"哑\"* [yǎ] are the same character, so *Héshàng* [河上] and *Nǎi* [柰] volumes use *\"哑\"* [yǎ]. However, *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is a later character. To restore *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s ancient text, we should follow the stele inscription’s *\"嗄\"* [shà]. Writing it as *\"嚘\"* [gōng], *\"○\"* [yī], *\"噫\"* [yī], or *\"哑\"* [yǎ] is incorrect.\n\n---\n*\"Knowing harmony as constant, knowing constancy as clarity, augmenting life as auspicious, directing qi by the heart as strength.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn [严可均] states: *\"Knowing constancy as clarity\"* [知常曰明], the *Héshàng* [河上] version reads *\"日明\"* [rìmíng], and the same applies to the following two sentences.\n\nBùnài Yìyǒng [武内义雄] notes that in the *\"augmenting life as auspicious\"* [益生曰祥] passage, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] manuscript preserved by Luó Zhènyù [罗振玉] reads *\"详\"* [xiáng].\n\nUpon examination, *\"祥\"* [xiáng] is a borrowed character for *\"牂\"* [zāng], synonymous with *\"壮\"* [zhuàng], aligning with the *\"物壮则老\"* [wùzhuàngzélǎo] *\"壮\"* [zhuàng] below. My note: Luó Zhènyù’s [罗振玉] *Kǎoyì* [考异] did not account for this. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] edition confirms *\"详\"* [xiáng], while Luó failed to correct it. The *Suì* [遂] edition lacks the *\"Knowing constancy as clarity\"* [知常曰明] sentence.\n\nThe word *\"曰\"* [yuē], in *Jǐngfú* [景福] and *Nǎi* [柰] volumes, is written as *\"日\"* [rì] for all three following sentences. The *Shìtōng* [室町] edition writes *\"日\"* [rì] for the last three sentences but *\"曰\"* [yuē] for the first.\n\nThe character *\"强\"* [qiáng], in *Lóuzhèng* [楼正] and *Wǔnèi Dūnhuáng* [武内敦煌] editions, is *\"强\"* [qiáng], while Fù Yì [傅奕]’s *\"曰强\"* [yuēqiáng] reads *\"则强\"* [zéqiáng].\n\nAdditionally, *\"益生曰祥\"* [yìshēngyuēxiáng], Lǐ Dàochún [李道纯]’s version reads *\"益生不祥\"* [yìshēngbùxiáng]. The *Dàodé Huìyuán Xùlì* [道德会元序例] states: *\"‘益生不祥’ is sometimes written as ‘日祥’ or ‘曰祥,’ both incorrect.\"* Lǐ’s [李] edition, based on *Héshàng Zhàngrén Zhāngjù Báiběn* [河上丈人章句白本], is logically sound.\n\nIn *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子], *Déchōng Fú* [德充符]: *\"Constantly following nature without augmenting life.\"* Augmenting life contradicts *Lǎozǐ*’s [老子] *\"generative generosity\"* [生生之厚], acting against spontaneity—thus, *\"not auspicious\"* [不祥].\n\nThe phrase *\"不祥\"* [bùxiáng] appears three times in the text: Chapter 31 *\"佳兵者不祥之器\"* [jiābīngzhébùxiángzhīqì], *\"兵者不祥之器\"* [bīngzhébùxiángzhīqì], and Chapter 78 *\"受国不祥\"* [shòuguóbùxiáng]. Only here does it appear as *\"祥\"* [xiáng], which is questionable. *\"祥\"* [xiáng] carries the meaning of *\"omen\"* or *\"portent.\"* Lǐ Qí [李奇] states: *\"Internal portents are called *‘shèng’* [眚], external portents are called *‘xiáng’* [祥].\"* The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] defines *\"祥\"* [xiáng] as *\"portentous omens.\"* Thus, *\"祥\"* [xiáng] is synonymous with *\"不祥\"* [bùxiáng].\n\nThe *Dàodé Jīng*’s *Qǔshàn Jíyǐn* [取善集引] cites Sūn Dēng [孙登]: *\"Generative generosity, when acted upon, becomes a portentous omen.\"* This aligns with the passage.\n\nYì Shùndǐng [易顺鼎] states: *\"‘祥’* [xiáng] is the same as *‘不祥’* [bùxiáng]. The *Shū* [书] *Xù* [序] says: ‘There was an auspicious *xiáng* [祥]—the *sāng* [桑] and *gǔ* [谷] trees grew together in the morning,’ where *xiáng* [祥] shares the same meaning. Wáng Bì’s [王弼] annotation states: ‘Life cannot be augmented; augmenting it leads to decline.’ The character *‘夭’* [yāo] should be *‘妖’* [yāo], interpreting *‘xiáng’* [xiáng] as *‘妖’* [yāo].\"* My note: The *Dàozàng* [道藏] *Zhāng Tàishǒu Huìkè Sìjiā Zhù* [张太守汇刻四家注] cites Wáng Bì [王弼] as writing *\"妖\"* [yāo].\n\nMǎ Xùlún [马叙伦] states: *\"The *Héshàng* [河上] annotation says: ‘If one knows the constant Dao and acts accordingly, one’s understanding will daily grow clearer toward the mysterious.’\"* Thus, *Héshàng* [河上] also writes *\"日明\"* [rìmíng].",

      "translated_text": "Chéng Shū states: *\"Excessive greed for worldly gain and excessive augmentation of life are what give rise to daily proliferation of afflictions and entanglements.\"* He further says: *\"Thus, the karmic causes of birth and death grow ever stronger each day.\"* This confirms that Chéng’s *\"rìxiáng\"* [日祥] should be *\"rìxiáng\"* [曰祥].\n\nMǎ Xùlún argues that *\"rì\"* [日] is a mistaken transcription for *\"yuē\"* [曰], as *\"yuē\"* [曰] and *\"zé\"* [则] are interchangeable. My note: The reading *\"yuē\"* [曰] is correct. The *Húinán Dàoyīng Xiàn* [淮南道应训] and *Wénzǐ Xià Dé Piān* [文子下德篇] both cite it as *\"yuē\"* [曰], and this should be followed. Liú Wéndiǎn’s *Sānyú Zházhì* (卷一) claims *\"yuē\"* [曰] should be *\"rì\"* [日], mistaken due to similar shapes, but this is incorrect, as the *Héshàng* text here proves otherwise.\n\nMǎ Xùlún further states: *\"Qì\"* [气] should be *\"qì\"* [气], and *\"qiáng\"* [强] is borrowed as *\"jiāng\"* [僵]. In the *Zhuāngzǐ Jiéyáng Piān* [庄子则阳篇], *\"tuī ér qiáng zhī\"* [推而强之] is cited in the *Yù Piān* [玉篇] as *\"jiāng\"* [僵], providing the precedent.\n\nIn *Lǎozǐ* and *Zhuāngzǐ*, the term *\"qì\"* [气] often surpasses *\"xīn\"* [心] in meaning, as seen in *Zhuāngzǐ Rénjiānshì Piān* [庄子人间世篇]:\n*\"Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the heart; do not listen with the heart, but listen with the *qì* [气]. The *qì* [气] is the empty vessel that awaits things.\"* In *Yìng Dìwáng* [应帝王], it states: *\"Let your mind dwell in serenity, and harmonize your *qì* [气] with emptiness.\"* In this text, *\"zhuāng qì zhì róu\"* [专气致柔] and *\"chōng qì yǐwéi hé\"* [冲气以为和] all follow this usage. Thus, *\"xīn shǐ qì yuē jiāng\"* [心使气曰僵] is correct.\n\nYú Yì states: *\"Below this passage, the original text originally included the lines: ‘Thus, using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.’ Later commentators omitted them, having already appeared in Chapter 52.\"* The *Húinán Dàoyīng Piān* [淮南道应篇] cites *Lǎozǐ* as saying: *\"Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity; augmenting life is called *xiáng* [祥]; the heart directing *qì* [气] is called *qiáng* [强]. Thus, using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.\"* This confirms that the ancient text originally contained these two lines.\n\nMoreover, *\"Using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity\"* clearly illustrates the idea that things cannot remain perpetually vigorous. Hence, the following passage states: *\"When vigor peaks, decay follows—this is called *bùdào* [不道]; *bùdào* [不道] brings early demise.\"* If these two lines are omitted, the meaning disconnects from what follows.\n\nThe *Wénzǐ Xià Dé Piān* [文子下德篇] states: *\"Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity; augmenting life is called *xiáng* [祥]; the heart directing *qì* [气] is called *qiáng* [强]. This is called *Xuántóng* [玄同]; using its brilliance, it returns to its clarity.\"* It also includes the subsequent two lines: *\"When vigor peaks, decay follows—this is called *bùdào* [不道]; *bùdào* [不道] brings early demise.\"* Yán Kějūn states: *\"This is called *bùdào* [不道]\"* is annotated in the *Yùzhù* [御注] and *Gāoxì* [高翿] as *\"Shìwèi bùdào\"* [是谓不道]. Luó Zhènyù notes that in the *Dūnjiāng* [敦煌] manuscripts, both *\"bù\"* [不] are written as *\"fēi\"* [非]. My note: The reading *\"bù\"* [不] is correct. *\"Zǎoyǐ\"* [早已] should be *\"zǎowáng\"* [早亡], as explained in Chapter 30. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] and *Gù* [顾] editions write *\"fēi\"* [非] for *\"bù\"* [不], while the *Yán* [严] edition writes *\"fēi\"* [非] in the first instance and *\"bù\"* [不] in the second. The *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Péng* [彭], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Zhào* [赵] editions all follow the stone text. Wáng Xīzhī writes *\"shìwèi\"* [是谓] instead of *\"wèi\"* [谓之], while *Héshàng* [河上] writes *\"wù zhuàng zé lǎo\"* [物壮则老] as *\"wù zhuàng jiāng lǎo\"* [物壮将老], and *Guāngmíng* [广明] writes *\"zǎoyǐ\"* [早已] as *\"zǎoyǐ\"* [早以]. The *Tàisū* [太素] Volume 3 also cites these three lines identically.\n\n**[Phonology]** Jiāng Shì’s rhyme reading for this chapter:\n*Shì* [螫], *jù* [据], *bó* [搏], *gù* [固], *zuò* [作], *shà* [嗄] (Fish department, *shì* as *shù*, *bó* as *bù*, *zuò* as *zǔ*, *shà* as *shū* with a falling tone).\n*Cháng* [常], *míng* [明], *xiáng* [祥], *qiáng* [强] (Yang department),\n*Lǎo* [老], *dào* [道], *yǐ* [已] (Zhi and Yu departments, *lǎo* as *lùshòu*, *yǐ* as *yǒuyǔ*).\n\nMy note: *Lǎo* [老] and *dào* [道] belong to the Yu department, while *yǐ* [已] belongs to the Zhi department, thus forming a *zhī-yōu* [之幽] rhyme. Yáo Wéntián and Dèng Tíngzhēn agree, except they write *\"shà\"* [嗄] as *\"yǎ\"* [哑] and omit the rhyme for *\"yǐ\"* [已]. Gāo Běn Hàn states that *\"shì\"* [螫] should be *\"shè\"* [赦], making *shè* [赦], *bó* [搏], *zuò* [作] rhyme with *jù* [据] and *gù* [固].\n\nGǔ Yánwù’s *Tángyùn Zhèng* (Volume 22, *Xī* [昔]): *\"Shì\"* [螫] in the falling tone is pronounced as *shè* [赦]. Volume 19, *Du* [铎]: *\"Bó\"* [搏] in the falling tone is pronounced as *fú* [甫], and in the citation of this *Lǎozǐ* passage, it is pronounced as *jùgù* [故反], while *\"shà\"* [嗄] is pronounced as *hù* [户]. Jiāng Yǒuguò’s *Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng* (Volume 22, *Xī* [昔]) states: *\"Shì\"* [螫], pronounced as *shìzhǐ* [施只].\n\nAccording to ancient usage, the falling and entering tones were interchangeable in rhyme. In *Lǎozǐ*, it states: *\"Fierce beasts do not *jù* [据], grasping birds do not *bó* [搏]; though bones are weak and sinews supple, their grip is firm.\"* Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *\"Shì\"* [螫], *\"jù\"* [据], *\"bó\"* [搏], *\"gù\"* [固], *\"zuò\"* [作], *\"shà\"* [嗄] form a rhyme. I note that *\"tuán\"* [抟] should be *\"bó\"* [搏]. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines *\"bó\"* [搏] as *\"seizing and holding.\"* The *Zhōulǐ Shèrén* [周礼射人] annotation for *\"lífǒu\"* [狸首] states: *\"The weasel is skilled at holding, and ‘holding’ is the same as ‘bó’ [搏].\"* The *Húinánzǐ* [淮南子] says: *\"When birds are cornered, they *bó* [搏]; when beasts are cornered, they *jué* [攫].\"* This is its meaning.

      "translated_text": "「攫」 in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* is defined as *\"the large mother monkey, skilled at seizing and holding others.\"*\n\nThe passage here, in its meaning, speaks of how poisonous insects are skilled at stinging (*shì* [螫]) yet do not sting, fierce beasts are skilled at seizing (*jù* [据]) yet do not seize, birds skilled at *bó* [搏] yet do not *bó*, and thus the sense also aligns.\n\nAgain, the character 「作」 was pronounced in ancient times like *zuò* [阼], *zì* [胙].\n\nThe *Yu* rhyme group’s ancient pronunciation was in the *Gòng* [御] department, though the *Shuōwén Jiězì* has no 「嗄」 character. The *Guǎngyuàn* [广韵] cites 「嗄」 from the *Lǎozǐ* [老子]: *\"终日号而不嗄\"*, annotated as *\"the voice does not change.\"* The *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] says of *Gēngsāng Chǔ* [庚桑楚]: *\"终日嗥而嗌不嗄\"*, matching this text. Thus, the *Lǎozǐ* originally had 「嗄」, rhyming with *shì* [螫], *jù* [据], *bó* [搏], *gù* [固], and 「作」.\n\nFù Yì [傅奕] emended the *Lǎozǐ* to read 「不○」; the *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] cites 「嚘」 in this passage as 「不嚘」, annotated as *\"the qi is obstructed.\"* Both variations stem from not recognizing 「嗄」 as a character belonging to the *Yu* rhyme group, leading to divergent readings.\n\nAdditionally, the *Lǎo* [老] and *Dào* [道] characters form a rhyme, both belonging to the *Yōu* [幽] department’s upper tone. 「老」 in ancient pronunciation was in the *Yōu* [黝] department: it rhymes with 「手」 in the *Shījì* [击鼓], with 「酒」 in *Nǚyuē* [女曰], with 「雠」, 「犹」, and 「丑」 in *Cǎiqí* [采芑], and with 「首」 in *Xiǎobiàn* [小弁]. In *Pànshuǐ* [泮水], it rhymes with 「○」, 「酒」, 「道」, and 「丑」.\n\nThe *Jīngdìng Shìwén* [景龙碑本] has **77 characters**, the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本] **75**, the *Héshàng* [河上] **79**, the *Wáng* [王本] **81**, the *Fù* [傅本] **83**, and the *Fàn* [范本] **82**.\n\nThe *Héshàng* [河上] titles this as *\"Chapter of Mysterious Harmony, the Fifty-Fifth\"* (玄符第五十五), the *Wáng* [王本] as *\"Chapter Fifty-Five\"* (五十五章), and the *Fàn* [范本] as *\"Chapter of the Depth of Virtue, the Fifty-Fifth\"* (含德之厚章第五十五).\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Six**\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù* [傅本] and *Fàn* [范本] both append 「也」 after 「不言」 and 「不知」. The *Héshàng* [河上公], *Wáng* [王弼], and other versions, as well as the annotations in *Lǐhuò Lùn* [理惑论], *Wénxuǎn* [文选]’s *Wèi Dū Fù* [魏都赋], and *Yùnmìng Lùn* [运命论], all omit these two 「也」 characters. *Fǔxíng Jì* [辅行记] also cites the same, but changes 「者」 to 「则」. The *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] in *Tiāndào Piān* [天道篇] states: *\"则知者不言，言者不知.\"* In *Zhīběi Yóu Piān* [知北游篇]: *\"夫知者不言，言者不知.\"* Both passages derive from this text and also lack 「也」.\n\nSeal its *yuè* [兑], close its gate, blunt its sharpness, disperse its wrath, harmonize its brilliance, and blend its dust—this is called *Mystic Uniformity* (玄同).\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: In the *Héshàng* [河上] version, 「解其忿」 is written as 「纷」, while *Wáng* [王弼] renders it as 「分」.\n\n*Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本], *Jǐngfú* [景福本], and *Suì* [遂本] all use 「忿」, likely because 「纷」 is a borrowed character for 「忿」.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Jǐngfú* [景福本], *Yán Zūn* [严遵], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] also use 「忿」, while *Qíng Xuán* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷], *Gù Huān* [顾欢], *Péng* [彭], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Zhào* [赵] render it as 「纷」. The *Lǚlùn* [吕览]’s *Shèn Dà Piān* [慎大篇] annotates 「纷纷分分」 as *\"fear and resentment\"*, likely considering 「分」 a contracted form of 「棼」. The *Shìwén Jiězì* [释文] for *Zuǒyǐn Sìchuán* [左隐四传] defines 「棼」 as *\"chaos\"*. *Wáng* [王本]’s 「解其分」 means to disperse its disorder. The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本], *Jǐngfú* [景福本], and *Suì* [遂本] all use 「忿」. The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅]’s *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines 「忿」 as *\"anger\"*. The *Yì Xiàngtuán* [易象传] states: *\"The virtuous one restrains anger and checks desires.\"* The *Chūcí* [楚辞]’s *Huáishā* [怀沙] uses 「惩改忿兮」, annotated as *\"resentment\"*, where 「改忿」 also means 「解其忿」—both interpretations are consistent.\n\n*Yì Shùndīng* [易顺鼎] says: These six lines have already appeared earlier; likely they are a repetition. The four lines of 「挫其锐」 match the *Shàng Piān* [上篇]’s *Dìsì Piān* [第四章], suggesting this annotation may also belong to the *Shàng Piān*’s *Dìsì Piān*. Both annotations in *Wénxuǎn* [文选]’s *Wèi Dū Fù* [魏都赋] and *Yùnmìng Lùn* [运命论] cite only the *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s line: *\"知者不言，言者不知，是谓玄同\"*, without these six lines, confirming their duplication.\n\n---\nThus, it cannot be approached with excessive familiarity, nor can it be avoided with excessive distance;\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: Before 「不可得而疏」, the *Héshàng* [河上] version adds 「亦」, and the same applies to the following two lines.\n\n*Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jǐngfú* [景福本] lacks the 「而」 character, and the same applies to the next five lines.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌本] and *Suì* [遂本] omit the six 「而」 characters; the *Yán Zūn* [严遵] and *Péng* [彭] versions lack 「故」; the *Fù* [傅本] and *Fàn* [范本] versions include 「亦」, and the same applies below.\n\nIt cannot be exploited for gain, nor can it be harmed;\n\n*Bì Qián* [毕沅] notes: *Wáng* [王弼] omits 「亦」, and the same applies below.\n\nAdditionally, 「害」 is written as 「刿」. *Sū Língzhī* [苏灵芝]’s text renders it as 「秽」. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines 「刿」 as *\"sharp injury\"*, but has no 「秽」 character.\n\nIt cannot be esteemed as noble, nor can it be disdained as lowly.\nThus, it is held in highest honor by the world.\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: All versions lack 「亦」, except the *Héshàng* [河上].\n\n*According to my examination*: In the sentence 「而疏」, *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷] includes 「亦」. In the sentences 「而害」 and 「而贱」, *Nǎi Juàn* [柰卷] and *Gù Huān* [顾欢] both include 「亦」. The sentence 「不可得而贵」 is omitted in *Zhào* [赵].\n\nAdditionally, the *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] in *Xúnwúguǐ Piān* [徐无鬼篇] states: *\"Thus, the true person has none whom he holds in excessive familiarity, nor has he any whom he avoids with excessive distance, embracing virtue and brilliance, to harmonize with the world—this is called the true person.\"*",

In **Chapter 45**, *\"Calmness and tranquility are the Dao/Way for the world\"* [清静为天下正], and in this chapter, *\"I love tranquility, and the people naturally align with rectitude\"* [我好静而民自正], both should use the original character.\n\n*Employing the Dao/Way in warfare*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The *Yù Zhù* [御注] mistakenly reads 「以奇」 as 「以其」.\n*Liú Shīpéi* [刘师培] says: Since 「奇」 is paired with 「正」, its meaning aligns with *yé* (邪, \"deviant\"). The *Guānzǐ Báixīn Piān* [管子白心篇] glosses: *\"A deviant person is one whose name and conduct are ruined\"* [奇身名废], and explains: *\"Deviant means unorthodox and not rectified.\"* Thus, 「奇」 means \"not rectified,\" and *employing the Dao/Way in warfare* refers to \"not relying on orthodox military methods.\"\n\n*Attaining the world through non-action.*\n\nHow do I know this to be so?\n*According to this.*\n\n*According to my examination*: *Attaining the world* refers to *winning the hearts of the people*. In **Chapter 48**, it states: *\"What is called attaining the world is to do so through non-action; when there is action, it is insufficient to attain the world.\"* *Xúnzǐ Wángzhì Piān* [荀子王制篇] corroborates this: *\"Chéng Hóu* [成侯] and *Sì Gōng* [嗣公] were rulers who accumulated wealth and calculated numbers, but they did not win the people’s hearts. *Zǐchǎn* [子产] won the people’s hearts, but he did not implement governance.\"* *Yáng Tà* [杨倞] annotates: *\"Unattained means their abilities were insufficient; winning the people’s hearts refers to gaining the people’s loyalty.\"* Thus, observing that action fails to win the people’s hearts confirms that non-action can gain their loyalty and attain the world.\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The phrase *知其然* [知其然], in the *Héshàng* [河上], *Wáng Rì* [王弼], and *Gāo Qì* [高翿] versions, has an additional 「哉」 at the end.\n*Wǔ Nèi Yì Xióng* [武内义雄] states: The *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] and *Suì* [遂] versions read 「天下之然」 for 「其然」.\n*Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes: The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Yù Zhù* [御注], and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions all lack the 「哉」 character.\n\n*According to my examination*: The *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read 「奚」 instead of 「何」, and have an additional 「天下」 after 「知」.

Ancient texts referred to deviant acts as 「奇物」, so 「奇物」 elucidates the meaning of 「邪事」.\n\nHowever, the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions, though following ancient usage, are more logically sound, and thus should be preferred.\n\n*\"When lawful things flourish, thieves and robbers abound.\"*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: The *Yùzhù* [御注], *Wáng Bì* [王弼], and *Gāo Yè* [高翿] versions read 「法令」 (laws and commands), while the *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] version reads 「法物」 (lawful things). *Héshàng* [河上] states: *\"‘法物’ means desirable things.\"* *Qiánzhī* [谦之] notes: The *Jǐngfú* [景福], *Nǎijuàn* [柰卷], and *Héshàng* [河上] versions all read 「法物」, while the *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Fù* [傅], *Fàn* [范], and *Wáng Xǐzhī* [王羲之] versions read 「法令」. The reading 「法令」 is correct; 「法物」 lacks meaning. *Zhāng Shèng* [章圣]’s *Běncóng* [本成] commentary states: *\"‘法物’ is the same as ‘法令’\"*, confirming that 「法令」 is the superior reading. The *Huánnán* [淮南] *Dàoyìng* [道应训], *Wénzǐ* [文子] *Dàoyuán* [道原篇], *Shǐjì* [史记] *Cūlì Lièchuán* [酷吏列传], and *Hànshū* [后汉书] *Dōngyí Chuán* [东夷传] all quote 「法令」. The character 「物」 likely resulted from confusion with the preceding 「奇物」.\n\n*\"When lawful commands flourish\"* [法令滋彰] aligns with *\"the heavy taxes on the people\"* [上食税之多] and *\"‘佳兵者不祥之器’ (Fine weapons are ominous tools)\"* [夫佳兵者不祥之器], all of which represent *Lǎozǐ* [老子]’s political philosophy—not merely opposition to luxurious objects.\n\nThe *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions read 「章」 instead of 「彰」, and the *Fàn* [范] version includes an unnecessary 「而」 after 「章」, which should be omitted.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet the people become upright;\nI take no action, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\n*Yán Kějūn* [严可均] notes: In most versions, 「人」 is written as 「而民」 in *\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves\"* [我无为，而民自化], and similarly in the following three sentences. The *Yùzhù* [御注] places *\"I take no action, yet the people grow wealthy\"* [我无事，人自富] above *\"I love tranquility\"* [我好静]. *Bì Qián* [毕沅] states: The *Míngdào Cáng* [明道藏] *Héshàng Gōng* [河上公] version includes an additional sentence: *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清], but this is not found in other versions. *Jì Yùn* [纪昀] notes: One version does include this sentence. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions all read 「朴」 (simple/uncorrupted), while the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌] version also includes the sentence *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清].\n\n*Qiánzhī* [谦之] notes: *Yán Zūn* [严遵], *Xíng Xuàn* [邢玄], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Wénzǐ* [文子] *Dàoyuán* [道原篇], *Yùlǎn* [御览] 76, and *Wénxuǎn* [文选] *Dōngjīng Fù* [东京赋注] all place *\"I take no action\"* [我无事] above *\"I love tranquility\"* [我好静], matching the *Yùzhù* [御注]. The *Yàn Tiě Lùn* [盐铁论] *Dàoxīn* [道秦] section quotes *\"I have no desires\"* [我无欲] above *\"I take no action\"* [我无事]. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州] version reads 「政」 (governance) instead of 「正」 (upright), and includes *\"the whole world\"* [天下] before 「自正」. *Bì Qián* [毕沅] states: 「靖」 (tranquil) is read as 「静」 (quiet) in other versions, and *\"the whole world\"* [天下] is also written as *\"the people\"* [民] in other versions. *Zhuāngzǐ* [庄子] reads: *\"Without action, all things transform themselves; profound stillness, and the people settle\"* [无为而万物化，渊静而百姓定]. *Zhào Mèngfǔ* [赵孟俯]’s version also includes the sentence *\"I have no emotions, yet the people become pure\"* [我无情而民自清]. The *Hànshū* [汉书] *Cáo Shēngchuán* [曹参传] *Yán Zhù* [颜注] quotes: *\"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves; I love tranquility, yet the people become upright\"* [我无为，民自化；我好静，民自正], matching this stone text except for 「人」 being written as 「民」. This version reads 「民」 (people) instead of 「人」 (person), as the inscriptions all avoid the Tang dynasty taboo on 「人」.\n\n**[Phonology]** *Jiāng* [江]’s rhyme scheme reads: *贫* [贫], *昏* [昏] (File department); *起* [起], *有* [有] (Zhi department); *为* [为], *化* [化] (Ge department); *静* [静], *正* [正] (Geng department); *事* [事], *富* [富] (Zhi department); *欲* [欲], *朴* [朴] (Hou department). *Yáo Wéntián* [姚文田], *Dèng Tíngzhēn* [邓廷桢], and *Xí Dòng* [奚侗] agree. *Xí* [奚] states: *\"‘无为’ (I take no action), ‘好静’ (I love tranquility), ‘无事’ (I take no action), and ‘无欲’ (I have no desires) differ in wording but share meaning, merely varied for rhyme.\"*\n\n*Gāo Běnhàn* [高本汉], due to the Tang dynasty taboo, reads *器* [器] for *贫* [贫], and *为* [为] for *化* [化], with *贫* [贫] and *昏* [昏] rhyming in alternating lines, while the rest follow the same scheme.\n\n*Yáo Nài* [姚鼐] states: Pure tranquility is the right path for the world, so governance is achieved through uprightness, with no other method. *奇* [奇] means surplus; the Dao of zeroing the surplus is complete yet not applied, and thus can also be used in warfare.

The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅] states: *\"Zhuó\"* [栻], *fú* [梮] (a wooden divination device). This *fú* [梮] embodies Heaven and Earth, used to observe yin and yang, and divine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, made from *fēngzǐ* [枫子] and *zǎoxīn* [枣心] wood. The *Hànshū Wángmào* [汉书王莽传] states: *\"The Heavenly Astronomy Officer examines the *fú* [栻] before him,\"* which is the same, though the character is also written as *\"shì\"* [式]. The *Zhōulǐ* [周礼] states: *\"The Grand Historian holds the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times, riding with the Grand Musician,\"* and Zhèng Sīnóng [郑司农] explains: *\"When the Grand Historian goes out, he holds the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times and divines auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.\"* Thus, *\"shì\"* [式] holds this meaning.\n\nQiánzhī notes: The *Yì* [易] explanation is quite distinct. Since Lǎozǐ was the Grand Historian beneath the *Zhōu* [周] pillar, Zēngzǐ’s question, as cited by Zhèng Xuán, states: *\"Lǎodān\"* [老聃], the Grand Historian of *Zhōu* [周]. Thus, it is likely that he once held the *shì* [式] to know the Heavenly times, which may also have been part of his duties.\n\nHere, it states: *\"To govern people and serve the Dao/Way of Heaven, nothing surpasses the standard dharma/law.\"* In Chapter Twenty-Eight: *\"To be the standard dharma/law for all under Heaven,\"* and Chapter Sixty-Five: *\"These two are also the standard dharma/law; always know the standard dharma/law,\"* the term *\"shì\"* [式] is consistently interpreted as the standard dharma/law, and this concept originates from observing celestial phenomena.\n\nOnly through *jǐn* [啬] is it called *zǎo fú* [早服].\nQiánzhī notes: The *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions render *\"jǐn\"* [啬] as *\"shì\"* [式]. *\"Wèi\"* [谓] is written as *\"wéi\"* [惟] in the *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions, as well as in Yán, Péng, Gù, Fù, and Fàn versions. *\"Zǎo\"* [早] is rendered as *\"zǎo\"* [蚤] in Yán’s version. Both *\"wéi\"* [谓] and *\"zǎo\"* [蚤] align with Hàn Fēi’s interpretation of Lǎozǐ.\n\n*\"Zǎo fú\"* [早服] is written as *\"zǎo fú\"* [早伏] in the *Dūnhuáng* and *Suì* versions, *\"zǎo fù\"* [早复] in Péng and Zhào’s versions, and matches this stone version in Fù and Fàn’s versions.\n\nFàn states: *\"Wáng Bì\"* [王弼], *\"Sūn Dēng\"* [孙登], and the world’s versions all read *\"zǎo fú\"* [早服].\n\nYú Yì states: According to *Kùn Xué Jìwén* [困学纪闻], Volume Ten, the two *\"fú\"* [服] characters are rendered as *\"fù\"* [复], and he also cites *Sīmǎ Gōng* [司马公] and *Zhū Wén Gōng* [朱文公]’s interpretations, stating *\"bùyuǎn ér fù\"* [不远而复].\n\nHe further states: *\"Wáng Bì’s version is ‘zǎo fú’ [早服], but his annotation reads ‘early fú [服] is constant,’ which should also be ‘fù’ [复].\"*\n\nNow, according to Hàn Fēi’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老] essay, it states: *\"He who is able to practice *jǐn* [啬] is one who follows the Dao/Way and submits to *lǐ* [理].

      "translated_text": "The passage above states: *\"From the Way and in accordance with Principle\"* [従于道而服于理], yet it also says *\"not to serve the Way and Principle\"*, and further declares *\"the empty and void serve the Way and Principle\"*—thus elucidating the meaning of Laozi’s *\"early service\"* [蚤服]. The *\"service\"* [服] in *\"service to\"* [服从] should indeed be *\"service\"* [服], leaving no room for doubt. Thus, it is clear that the *Déjīng* [德经] cited by Hàn Fēi reads *\"service\"* [服], not *\"repeat\"* [复].\n\nThe *Kùnxué Jìwén* [困学纪闻] cites Laozi with *\"service\"* [服] as *\"repeat\"* [复], also quoting Sīmǎ Guāng and Zhú Wén Gōng as saying: *\"Not distant and yet returning\"* [不远而复], claiming *\"Wáng Bì’s text reads ‘early service’ [早服], but his annotation states ‘early service is the constant’ [早服常也], which should also be ‘returning’ [复].\"* By this account, Wáng Bì’s text still reads *\"service\"* [服], aligning with this book. The Sòng scholars, relying on the *Shìwén* [释文] for interpretation, failed to verify Hàn Fēi’s text. Líng Shì [凌氏] altered the text based on a corrupted Laozi manuscript, which is incorrect.\n\n**My examination:** *\"Early service\"* [蚤服] is correct. Fàn Běn [范本] cites Wáng’s text as *\"early returning\"* [早复], and the *Dàozàng* [道藏] Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu’s [张太守] compilation of the Four Commentaries quotes Wáng’s annotation: *\"Early returning is the constant\"* [早复常也], *\"Early returning is called the repeated accumulation of virtue\"* [早复谓之重积德者也]. Thus, both Fàn [范] and Zhāng [张] saw that Wáng’s text also had instances of *\"returning\"* [复]. Sīmǎ Guāng said: *\"Not distant and yet returning, not departing from virtue—this can be used to cultivate oneself.\"* Zhú Xī said: *\"If one practices *jǐn* [啬], then one is not distant and yet returns, repeatedly accumulating virtue—first, one has already accumulated [virtue], and later, one nurtures it through *jǐn* [啬], which is yet another layer of accumulation.\"* All of these interpretations apply Confucian reasoning to Laozi, arbitrarily changing *\"early service\"* [早服] to *\"early returning\"* [早复]. The *\"corrupted manuscript\"* [误本] that Wáng Xiānshèn refers to is likely this very alteration.\n\nGāo Hēng conjectures: *\"Perhaps there should be a ‘Way’ [道] after ‘service’ [服], making ‘early service to the Way’ [早服道], which parallels the structure of ‘repeatedly accumulating virtue’ [重积德]. The phrase ‘service to the Way’ [服道] aligns with Chapter 23’s ‘engaging in the Way’ [从事于道].\"* The Hàn Fēi’s citation lacks the ‘Way’ [道], indicating that the omission occurred long ago. This chapter’s rhyme scheme follows: *jǐn* [啬], *dào* [道], *dé* [德], *kè* [克], *jí* [极], *mǔ* [母], *jiǔ* [久], *dào* [道]. The ‘Way’ [道] is also omitted after *\"early service\"* [早服] in the following sentence.\n\n**My examination:** Gāo’s conjecture is correct. Héshàng Gōng’s [河上公] annotation on *\"early service\"* [早服] states: *\"Early means ‘prior’; service means ‘obtaining.’ He who loves the people’s wealth and cherishes *qì* [精气] can first obtain the Way of Heaven.\"* His annotation on *\"repeatedly accumulating virtue\"* [重积德] reads: *\"To first obtain the Way of Heaven is called repeatedly accumulating virtue in oneself.\"* Thus, both of Héshàng Gōng’s sentences originally included ‘Way’ [道], now omitted.\n\n*\"Early service\"* is called *\"repeatedly accumulating virtue.\"* Wáng Xiānshèn notes: *\"Héshàng Gōng’s ‘is called’ [谓之] is written as ‘this is called’ [是谓], matching the text in Hàn Fēi’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老].\"* **My examination:** Yán Zhēn’s [严遵] text lacks this sentence. The characters *\"early service\"* [蚤服] can be verified through Hàn Fēi’s annotation, where *\"service\"* [服] is interpreted as *\"serving the Way and Principle\"* [服从道理].\n\nThe *Yú Shū* [虞书] states: *\"The Five Punishments have their service\"* [五刑有服], with the transmission explaining: *\"Follow\"* [从也]. The *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines *\"service\"* [服] as *\"to attend to\"* [事也]. The *Lǐjì* [礼记] *Kǒngzǐ Xiánjū* [孔子闲居] states: *\"The gentleman’s service to it\"* [君子之服之也], with the annotation: *\"Like habituation\"* [犹习也]. *\"Service\"* [服] carries the meaning of *\"following and habituating\"* [从习], meaning *\"following the Way and habituating to Principle\"* [从于道而习于理].\n\nAdditionally, *\"virtue\"* [德] is borrowed for *\"obtain\"* [得]. The *Guǎngyǎ* [广雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] states: *\"Virtue, to obtain\"* [德，得也]. The *Zuǒzhuàn* [左传] (24th year of Duke Xiāng) says: *\"Virtue is the foundation of the state\"* [德，国家之基也]. The *Jiālǐng* [家语] *Rùguān* [入官] states: *\"Virtue is the beginning of governance\"* [德，政之始也]. The *Lǚshì* [吕览] *Jīngtōng* [精通] declares: *\"Virtue is the sovereign of the people\"* [德也者，万民之宰也]. All these instances borrow *\"virtue\"* [德] for *\"obtain\"* [得].\n\nIt states: *\"Early service to the Way and Principle\"* [早服从道理] *\"accumulates deep and profound virtue\"* [则积得深厚也]. Repeatedly accumulating virtue means nothing is unconquered; nothing unconquered means its limits are unknown. Yán Kějūn [严可均] notes: *\"Then nothing is unconquered\"* [则无不克], with the Imperial annotation and Wáng Bì reading *\"unconquered\"* [不克], as in the following sentence.\n\n**My examination:** The *Jǐngfú* [景福], Yán Zhēn [严遵], Héshàng Gōng [河上公], Shìmáng [室町], and Nǎijuǎn [柰卷] texts all read *\"conquer\"* [克], while the *Dūnhuáng* [敦煌], Fù [傅], and Fàn [范] texts also read *\"conquer\"* [克], whereas the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] text mistakenly reads *\"fill\"* [充]. Yán Zhēn’s text lacks the following *\"nothing is unconquered, its limits are unknown\"* [无不克则莫知其极] sentences.\n\n**Examination:** *\"Conquer\"* [克] and *\"able\"* [能] can be used interchangeably. Both the *Zìlín* [字林] and *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìyán* [释言] define *\"conquer\"* [克] as *\"able\"* [能]. Héshàng Gōng’s annotation states: *\"Conquer, to overcome\"* [克，胜也]. The *Zìlín* [字林] defines *\"conquer\"* [克] as *\"able\"* [能], indicating that the sound and meaning are identical.\n\nThe *Éryá* [尔雅] *Shìgǔ* [释诂] defines *\"extreme\"* [极] as *\"to reach\"* [至也]. The *Lǚshì* [吕览] *Zhìyuè* [制乐] states: *\"How can the musician know its extreme?\"* [乐人焉知其极], with the annotation: *\"Like ‘end’* [犹终也]. The *Lǐjì* [礼记] *Dàxué* [大学] says: *\"The gentleman exhausts all things\"* [君子无所不用其极], with the annotation: *\"Exhaust\"* [尽也]. The *Lí Sāo* [离骚] states: *\"Observing the people’s calculations reach their extreme\"* [观民之计极], with the annotation: *\"Exhaustion\"* [穷也]. Here, *\"its limits are unknown\"* [莫知其极] means *\"its exhaustion is unknown\"* [莫知其所穷尽之义].\n\nIf its limits are unknown, one can establish a state. The foundation of establishing a state can endure long. **My examination:** The *Dūn* [敦] and *Suì* [遂] texts read *\"able\"* [能] instead of *\"unknown\"* [莫], Yán’s [严] text reads *\"can be\"* [为] instead of *\"establish\"* [有], and the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] text reads *\"long enduring\"* [久长] instead of *\"long\"* [长久]. Fàn’s [范] text includes *\"then\"* [则] after *\"extreme\"* [极]. Fàn states: *\"The ‘then’ [则] character appears in Héshàng Gōng’s and Hàn Fēi’s ancient texts.\"*\n\nThis is called the *Dao* of deep roots, firm foundations, longevity, and enduring vision. Yán Kějūn [严可均] notes: *\"Firm foundations\"* [固蒂] is annotated in the Imperial text as *\"old foundations\"* [故蒂] and by Wáng Bì as *\"firm roots\"* [固柢]. Bì Yàn [毕沅] states: *\"Roots\"* [柢], Héshàng Gōng reads as *\"foundations\"* [蒂], and Hàn Fēi reads: *\"Deepen its roots, firm its foundations\"* [深其根，固其柢], without the *\"this is called\"* [是谓] characters.",
      "overlap_context": "ú’* [服] as ‘fù’* [复], with both characters identical in the upper and lower sentences. Wáng Bì’s version reads ‘fù’* [复], and the *Shìwén* [释文] states: ‘*fù* [复] pronounced as *fú* [服].’\"*\n\nGù Guǎngchì states: *\"Fù’s version and the current *Déjīng* [德经] render ‘wèi’* [谓] as ‘wéi’* [惟]. The current *Déjīng* [德经] renders ‘yǐ’* [以] as ‘wèi’* [谓], aligning with Fù’s version.\"*\n\nWáng Xiānshèn states: *\"Líng’s version renders it as ‘fù’* [复], likely due to a miscorrection of the ancient Lǎozǐ text.\"*",

In the *Shī* [诗], *\"Yǒu tù sīshǒu\"* [有兔斯首], the *Jiān* [笺] explains: *\"Sī* [斯] *means ‘white.’\"* Today, *\"sībái\"* [斯白] is written as *\"xiān\"* [鲜], confirming this. *\"Xiǎoxiān\"* [小鲜] is thus *\"xiǎoxiān\"* [小鲜].\n\nQián Zhī [谦之] concludes: Both Hóng [洪] and Yì [易] offer convoluted interpretations, yet it is clear that *\"ruò\"* [若] likely originally read *\"kǔ\"* [苦], and *\"xiān\"* [鲜] may have been *\"xiān\"* [澌] in the strict text.\n\nFurther, *Hánfēizǐ* [韩非子]’s *Jiě Lǎo* [解老] includes *\"guó\"* [国] followed by *\"zhě\"* [者], with *Gù Guǎngqì* [顾广圻] noting: *\"The Fèi* [傅] *text and today’s* Dàodéjīng [道德经] *lack the ‘zhě’* [者] *character.\"* Wáng Xiānshèn [王先慎] states: *\"The* Zhìyào [治要] *includes ‘zhě’* [者].\"*\nUpon review, the *Sān Guó Zhì* [三国志] (Vol. 44, Chén Shǔ’s [陈寿] evaluation) reads: *\"Zhì dàguó zhě ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国者若烹小鲜], the *Hòuhànshū* [后汉书] *Xúnlì Zhuan* [循吏传] annotation cites: *\"Lǐ dàguó ruò hēng xiǎoxiān yě\"* [理大国若亨小鲜也], and the *Shǔ Zhì* [蜀志] *Jiāng Wéi Zhuan* [姜维传] evaluation quotes: *\"Zhì dàguó zhě yóu pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国者犹烹小鲜], all including *\"zhě\"* [者]. Conversely, the *Běitáng Shūchuán* [北堂书钞] (Vol. 27) cites *\"Zhì guó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治国若烹小鲜], the *Hòuhànshū* [后汉书] *Yìmín Zhuan* [逸民传] quotes *\"Lǐ dàguó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [理大国若烹小鲜], the *Lèijú* [类聚] (Vol. 52), *Huáinán Qísú Xuǎn* [淮南齐俗训], and *Wénzǐ Dàodé Piān* [文子道德篇] all read *\"Zhì dàguó ruò pēng xiǎoxiān\"* [治大国若烹小鲜], lacking *\"zhě\"* [者], matching this stele.\n\nAdditionally, *Mǎ Qíchǎng* [马其昶] notes: *\"The* Máo Zhuan [毛传] *of the* Shī [诗] *states: ‘Stirring fish too much breaks it; governing the people too much scatters them.

This aligns with the *Shuōwén*’s citation of Lǎozǐ’s ‘盅’ [盅] character, both being precious ancient script.\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"‘○’ and ‘莅’ share the same meaning. The *Yùpiàn* [玉篇] defines ‘邪’ [邪] (with the pronunciation *lìzhì* [力致]) as in the *Shī* [诗]: ‘Fāngshū yé zhǐ’ [方叔邪止], meaning ‘to oversee.’ The ‘○’ [○] is defined as *lìjì* [力季] and *lìzhì* [力至], meaning ‘to oversee’ or ‘to follow.’ Thus, ‘以道○天下’ means ‘to govern the realm with the Dao,’ identical in meaning to ‘邪’ [邪]. The character ‘邪’ appears in the *Shījīng* [诗经], yet is absent from the *Shuōwén*, proving it was not absent in antiquity.\"*\n\nQiánzhī further notes: *\"The *Lùnhéng Zhīshí Piān* [论衡知实篇] states: ‘Thus, the virtuous and sage are titles for moral excellence and ability; *shén* [神] refers to the intangible, elusive essence.’ Here, ‘贤圣’ [virtuous and sage] is contrasted with ‘神’ [spirit], reflecting Lǎozǐ’s intent.\"*\n\nWang Dào elaborates: *\"The *Zhuàn* [传] says: ‘When a state is about to flourish, it listens to the people; when it is about to decline, it listens to the spirits.’ When the sage governs the realm with the Dao, public virtue shines clearly, and the people’s hearts remain pure. Good and evil, fortune and misfortune, are all determined by the people; yet fabrications and malevolent influences find no place. Thus, its spirits lose their potency—not that they are powerless, but that they no longer harm the people.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn notes: *\"The *Yùzhù* [御注] reads ‘伤民’ [harm the people]; the same applies to the following two sentences.\"*\n\nQiánzhī annotates: *\"The *Qìngyáng* [庆阳], *Pánxī* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Péng* [彭], *Fàn* [范], and *Gāo* [高] editions all read ‘民’ [people], while the Fu edition reads ‘人’ [person]. The *Hánfēizǐ* [韩非子] citation—‘非其鬼不神，其神不伤人也’ [If its spirits are not potent, their potency does not harm people]—includes the ‘也’ [also] character.

Since ‘之’ and ‘亦’ are visually similar, scribes mistakenly wrote ‘亦’; now, ‘之’ is restored. It means that these spirits do not harm things, but when the people govern the realm with the Dao, they can subdue evil influences (the *Gùběn* [顾本] and *Qiángběn Chéngshū* [强本成疏] render ‘耶’ [interrogative] as ‘邪’ [malevolent]), so the spirits no longer harm the people. The power lies in sage governance (the *Gùběn Chéngshū* [顾本成疏] renders ‘治’ [govern] as ‘理’ [principle]), hence ‘the sage does not harm people.’\"*\n\nTáo Hóngqìng argues: *\"The characters ‘非其’ [If its] are likely a textual error, mistakenly inserted from the preceding ‘非其鬼不神’ [If its spirits are not potent].\"*\n\nWáng Zhù [王注] states: *\"When the Dao permeates, the spirits do not harm the people; if the spirits do not harm the people, they are no longer recognized as spirits.

      "original_text": "「治大国若居下流」与上章「治大国若烹小鲜」句法一律，文有讹捝，遂不可读矣。 论语阳货篇：「恶居下流而讪上者。 」子张篇：「君子恶居下流。 」可证「居下流」为古代习用语。 居下流者不敢自满自傲，故老子取焉。 天下之交，天下之牝。 牡常以静胜牝，以静为下。 严可均曰：「天下之牝」，御注作「之交」，高翿作「之交牝」。 「牡常以静胜牝」，各本作「牝常以静胜牡」。 魏稼孙曰：严分「天下之牝」及「牡常以静胜牝」为二条。 按各本作「牝常以静胜牡」，当以六字为句，如此刻则似「天下之牝牡」一句，「常以静胜」一句，「牝以静为下」句。 谦之案：「天下之交」，敦煌辛本及遂州本「交」作「郊」，成玄英曰：「郊，郊外也。 」又「天下之郊」重迭，成曰：「『天下之郊』牒前，又以生后句也，无上『牝』字。 」严遵本作「大国者，天下之所流，天下之所交」，无「常」字，下「以」上有「牝」字。 范本作：「天下之下流，天下之所交也。 天下之牲，牝常以静胜牡，以其静，故为下也。 」傅本末句同范本，「静」作「靖」。 磻溪、楼正、顾欢、高翿作「天下之交牝」，敦、遂二本无「以静为下」句。 诸本纷异，碑本句读从严可均，惟第三句当从诸河上本作「牝常以静胜牡」。 盖「天下之牝」犹言天下之母也。 二十五章「以为天下母」，说文：「母，牧也。 」段注：「牧者，养人者也。 以譬人之乳子，引申之，凡能生以启后者，皆曰母。 」牝，畜母也，雌也，主生养人，故与「母」同义。 下云「大国不过欲兼畜人」，兼畜人者，即善生养人，乃言牝也。 吴澄注：「牝不先动以求牡，牡常先动以求牝。 动求者招损，静俟者受益，故曰『以静胜牡』。 动求者居上，静俟者居下，故曰『以静为下』。 」吴说得之。 又案：「静」字，敦煌辛本作「」，傅本作「靖」。 「静」、「」、「靖」三字可通用。 夏竦古文四声韵卷三出「静」字，引古老子作○。 又出「」字，引古老子作○、○、○，卷四出「净」字，引古老子字与「」字下所引同，引籀韵作○，惟无「靖」字。 盖「靖」即「净」字。 四十五章「清静以为天下正」，敦煌己本「静」作「净」，知「静」、「净」、「靖」三字互通。 又案「交」字，即六十章「故得交归」之「交」。 吴澄曰：「交，会也。 大国者，诸小国之交会，如水之下流，为天下众水之交会也。 」可见遂州本以「交」为「郊」，与磻溪、诸本以「交牝」连文，均误。 故大国以下小国，则取小国； 小国以下大国，则取大国。 严可均曰：「则取大国」，御注作「则聚」。 罗振玉曰：御注本、敦煌辛本均作「聚」，下「而取」同。 谦之案：遂州、顾欢、道藏河上本、赵至坚本亦作「聚」。 成玄英疏：「小国自知卑下，守分雌柔，聚于大国之中，钦风慕义也。 」又曰：「小国用柔，故聚于大国； 大国用下，故取得万国之欢心。 用下则同，聚取斯别，故言或也。 」知成疏下句下「取」亦作「聚」。 又「取」下，傅本皆有「于」字。 劳健曰：「聚」字诸本多误同上句，亦作「取」。 开元本、敦煌唐写本，周氏残片与道藏龙兴碑本、赵至坚本皆作「聚」，是也。",
      "translated_text": "The passage *\"Governing a great state is like residing in the lower reaches\"* aligns in structure with the earlier chapter’s *\"Governing a great state is like simmering a small delicacy\"*—its text contains errors and omissions, rendering it unreadable as is.\n\nIn the *Yánghuò* [阳货] chapter of the *Analects* [论语], it states: *\"The Master abhorred those who dwelled in the lower reaches and slandered above.\"* In the *Zǐzhāng* [子张] chapter: *\"The Master abhorred dwelling in the lower reaches.\"* This confirms that *\"dwell in the lower reaches\"* [居下流] was a common ancient phrase.\n\nThose who dwell in the lower reaches dare not be self-satisfied or arrogant, hence the *Lǎozi* [老子] adopts it. *\"The junction of all under heaven is the female of all under heaven.\"* The male is always victorious over the female through stillness, and stillness is the lower.\n\n**Evidence One:** *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] reads *\"the female of all under heaven\"* [天下之牝], while the *Imperial Commentary* [御注] inserts *\"the junction\"* [之交], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] reads *\"the junction, the female\"* [之交牝]. The various texts all render *\"the female is always victorious over the male through stillness\"* [牝常以静胜牝], but the correct reading should be six characters: *\"the junction of all under heaven\"* [天下之交], *\"the female\"* [牝], *\"is always victorious over the male\"* [常以静胜牡], *\"and stillness is the lower\"* [以静为下]. Thus, it reads: *\"The junction of all under heaven is the female of all under heaven. The female is always victorious over the male through stillness, and stillness is the lower.\"*\n\n**Evidence Two:** *Yán Zūn* [严遵]’s version reads: *\"Great states are where all under heaven flows to, where all under heaven converges\"* [大国者，天下之所流，天下之所交], omitting the *\"always\"* [常] character and placing *\"the female\"* [牝] above *\"with\"* [以].\n\n**Evidence Three:** *Fàn* [范]’s version states: *\"The lower reaches of all under heaven are where all under heaven converges. The beast of all under heaven—the female is always victorious over the male through stillness, and with its stillness, it is the lower.\"* *Fù* [傅]’s version ends similarly to *Fàn*’s, but renders *\"stillness\"* [静] as *\"tranquility\"* [靖].\n\n**Evidence Four:** The *Bànqí* [磻溪], *Lóuzhèng* [楼正], *Gǔhuān* [顾欢], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] versions read *\"the junction, the female\"* [天下之交牝], while the *Dūng* [敦煌] and *Suì* [遂州] versions omit *\"and stillness is the lower\"* [以静为下].\n\nAll versions differ; the *Stele Edition* [碑本] follows *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] except for the third sentence, where it adopts the *Shù* [诸] *Héshàng* [河上] versions’ *\"the female is always victorious over the male through stillness\"* [牝常以静胜牡].\n\n*\"The female of all under heaven\"* is akin to saying *\"the mother of all under heaven.\"* In Chapter Twenty-Five: *\"It is the mother of all under heaven.\"* The *Shuōwén Jiězì* [说文解字] defines *\"mother\"* [母] as *\"nurturer\"* [牧]. *Duàn’s* annotation [段注] states: *\"Nurturer refers to one who nourishes others. By analogy, anything that can generate and give rise to what follows is called ‘mother.’\"* The female is the nurturing beast, the receptive one, and thus shares meaning with *\"mother\"* [母]. Later it states: *\"Great states merely desire to shelter and nourish all under heaven\"*—to shelter and nourish all under heaven is to speak of the female.\n\n*Wú Chéng* [吴澄]’s annotation reads: *\"The female does not move first to seek the male; the male always moves first to seek the female. The one who moves to seek invites harm, while the one who waits in stillness receives benefit, hence ‘the female is always victorious over the male through stillness.’ The one who moves to seek is above, while the one who waits in stillness is below, hence ‘stillness is the lower.’\"* *Wú’s* explanation is correct.\n\nFurther, *\"stillness\"* [静] appears as *\"\"* [净] in the *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] *Xīnběn* [辛本] and *\"tranquility\"* [靖] in *Fù*’s [傅] version. *\"Stillness\"* [静], *\"\"* [净], and *\"tranquility\"* [靖] are interchangeable. In *Xià Sǒng*’s [夏竦] *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn* [古文四声韵], Volume Three, *\"stillness\"* [静] is cited from ancient *Lǎozi* [老子] texts. Volume Four also cites *\"\"* [净] from ancient *Lǎozi* [老子] texts, matching the usage under *\"\"* [净] in *Zhǔyǔn* [籀韵], though *\"tranquility\"* [靖] is absent. Thus, *\"tranquility\"* [靖] is the same as *\"\"* [净].\n\nAgain, regarding *\"junction\"* [交], it is the same as *\"交\"* in Chapter Sixty: *\"Hence, they can return and join.\"* *Wú Chéng* [吴澄] states: *\"‘Junction’ means ‘convergence.’ Great states are the convergence point of all small states, like the lower reaches of water, which are the convergence point of all waters under heaven.\"* Thus, the *Suìzhōu* [遂州] and *Gǔhuān* [顾欢] versions, along with the *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上] and *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] versions, are incorrect in rendering *\"junction\"* [交] as *\"outskirts\"* [郊] or *\"junction, the female\"* [交牝] together.\n\nTherefore, when great states are below small states, they take from the small states; when small states are below great states, they take from the great states. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] reads *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚], following the *Imperial Commentary* [御注]. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Imperial Commentary* [御注] and the *Dūngxiāng Xīnběn* [敦煌辛本] both render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚], with *\"and take\"* [而取] following.\n\n**Evidence Five:** The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gǔhuān* [顾欢], *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上], and *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] versions also render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚]. *Chéng Xuānyīng*’s [成玄英] commentary states: *\"Small states know their own inferiority, guard their boundaries in meekness, and gather under the great state, revering its winds and admiring its virtues.\"* He also states: *\"Small states use softness, hence they gather under great states; great states use humility, hence they win the affection of all states. Softness and humility are the same, but gathering and taking differ, hence it is said ‘or.’\"* Thus, *\"take\"* [取] in the latter part of *Chéng’s* commentary is also rendered *\"gather\"* [聚].\n\n**Evidence Six:** Below *\"take\"* [取], *Fù’s* [傅] version includes *\"at\"* [于]. *Láo Jiàn* [劳健] states: *\"The character ‘gather’ [聚] is often mistakenly rendered as ‘take’ [取] in the same sentence by various versions.\"* The *Kāiyuán* [开元] version, the *Dūngxiāng Tángxiě* [敦煌唐写] version, *Zhōu’s* [周] fragments, the *Dàozàng Lóngxīng Bēiběn* [道藏龙兴碑本], and the *Zhào Zhìběn* [赵至本] version all correctly render *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚].",
      "overlap_context": "\"if\"* [若] and *\"residing\"* [居], with *\"residing low\"* [處下] elucidating *\"residing\"* [居]. This proves the *Wáng* version originally had *\"if\"* [若] and *\"residing\"* [居], without the erroneous *\"[great]\"* [者]. This is **Evidence Two**.\n\nThe *Shìwén* [释文] inserts the character *\"governing\"* [治] between *\"evil\"* [邪] and *\"female\"* [牝], noting: *\"Read as *Zhíliào* [直吏].\"* This confirms that Lù’s [陆] source—Wáng’s version—originally contained the *\"governing\"* [治] character.

      "translated_text": "「*Gather* [聚] is akin to *attach and seek protection*—the same meaning as in the following chapter’s *\"The wicked are shunned by all\"* [不善，人所保]. All versions rendering it as *\"take\"* [取] must be errors for the character *ji* [积, ]. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: *\"Ji [积, ], to accumulate.\"* Xu Shí [徐锴] notes: *\"Ancient texts used *ji* [积, ] for the same meaning as *jù* [聚, gather].\"* Since the Han dynasty, this character has been mistakenly used as *\"most\"* [最], as seen in Cài Zhàn’s [蔡湛] inscription *\"Three years of supreme merit\"* [三载勋最]. This must be due to scribes not recognizing *ji* [积, ]’s original meaning, arbitrarily removing the radical and writing *\"take\"* [取]. Commentators then forced interpretations, which do not hold.\n\n**Qián Zhì’s [谦之] note:** The character *\"take\"* [取] here carries the same meaning as *\"gather\"* [聚]. The first *\"take\"* [取] is a phonetic loan for *\"gather\"* [聚]. In the *Zuǒ Zhuan* [左传], *\"Taking people from the reeds and rushes\"* [取人于萑苻之泽] and in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *\"Heavenly Pivot\"* [天运], *\"Taking disciples to dwell beneath\"* [取弟子游居寝卧其下] both imply *\"gather.\"* The *Yìjīng* [易经] *Cuì* [萃] hexagram commentary states: *\"Gather to rectify\"* [聚以正也], with the *Shìwén* [释文] noting: *\"Xún [荀] renders it as *take* [取].\"* Thus, *\"take\"* [取] and *\"gather\"* [聚] are interchangeable; no character change is needed.\n\nThe second *\"take\"* [取] carries the meaning *\"gather at\"* [聚于], equivalent to *\"seek\"* [趣]. The *Shìmíng* [释名] explains: *\"Take [取], to seek [趣].\"* The *Hànshū* [汉书] *Wáng Jí* [王吉] commentary states: *\"Take [取], to advance and seek [进趣].\"* *\"Seek\"* [趣] means *\"to turn toward.\"* The *Huáinán Zǐ* [淮南子] *Yuándào* [原道] states: *\"Holding its essentials and returning to its natural tendency\"* [秉其要归之趣], meaning *\"to turn toward.\"* When a small state submits to a great state, it seeks [趣] the great state. Hence, *\"or submits to take\"* [或下以取] and *\"or submits as if taking\"* [或下而取].\n\nYán Kějūn [严可均] notes: The *Yùzhù* [御注] below renders it *\"or submits and gathers\"* [或下而聚], while *Héshàng* [河上], *Wáng Bì* [王弼], and *Gāo Yì* [高翿] render it *\"or submits and takes\"* [而取]. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] version renders *\"with\"* [以] as *\"and\"* [而].\n\nBelow, the *Jìnglóng* [景龙], *Jìngfú* [景福], and *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] versions all render it as *\"as if\"* [如], while the *Xīn* [辛] version renders it as *\"and\"* [而]. **Qián Zhì’s note:** The *Fù* [傅] version lacks the *\"thus\"* [故] character. The *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gǔ Huān* [顾欢], *Dàozàng Héshàng* [道藏河上], and *Zhào Zhì* [赵至] versions render the second *\"take\"* [取] as *\"gather\"* [聚]. *Yán Zūn* [严遵]’s version reads: *\"Thus, or submits and takes, or submits and takes from others\"* [故或下而取，或下而取于人].\n\nYú Yì [俞樾] notes: In ancient texts, *\"with\"* [以] and *\"and\"* [而] were interchangeable.

The *Xìcí Zhuàn* [系辞传] states: *\"The virtue of the stalks is round and divine, the virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing\"* [蓍之德圆而神，卦之德方以知]. The *Zuǒ Zhuan* [左传], *Zhāo* [昭] Eleventh Year, states: *\"Jie amassed wealth and lost his state, Zhou amassed the Eastern Yi and perished\"* [桀克有缗以丧其国，纣克东夷而陨其身]. *Mèngzǐ*’s *Gàozǐ* [告子] states: *\"The kings of Qin and Chu delighted in profit and dismissed their armies\"* [秦、楚之王悦于利，以罢三军之师]; *\"The kings of Qin and Chu delighted in virtue and dismissed their armies\"* [秦、楚之王悦于仁义，而罢三军之师]. All examples show *\"with\"* [以] and *\"and\"* [而] used interchangeably.\n\n*\"Great states submit to small states and take small states; small states submit to great states and take great states\"* is equivalent to *\"Great states, submitting to small states, take small states; small states, submitting to great states, take great states.\"* Thus, *\"or submits to take, or submits and takes\"* [或下以取，或下而取] carries identical meaning, suggesting textual corruption.\n\nGreat states merely seek to encompass others; small states merely seek to serve others. These two desires, when fulfilled, make submission fitting. **Yán Kějūn** notes: *Héshàng* [河上] and *Wáng Bì* [王弼] render *\"these two\"* [此两者] as *\"these\"* [夫], while *Gāo Yì* [高翿] omits *\"these\"* entirely. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] states: The *Jìngfú* [景福] and *Dūngxiāng* [敦煌] versions lack *\"these two\"* [夫两者].

      "original_text": "道为万物之藏，无所不容也。 」 彭耜释文曰：「『奥』，李乌报切。 言道体无外而万物资给于奥中。 」隋书经籍志曰「道者，盖为万物之奥」，即本此。 合此二义，则道为万物之奥，即为万物之温暖处也。 高亨说：「○，藏谷也，从，奉米内穴中。 」此则非是。 案字鉴曰：「奥，于到切，深也，从从采。 音辨从，音拱，今作大，俗。 中从米粟字，误。 」 善，人之宝； 不善，人之所不保。 严可均曰：「不善，人之所不保」，各本作「所保」。 罗振玉曰：敦煌辛本「所」下有「不」字。 武内义雄曰：敦、景、遂三本作「所不保」，「不」字恐衍。 谦之案：严遵亦作「所不保」，赵志坚同，但「保」作「宝」。 尹文子大道篇引「不善人之所宝」，傅、范本有「所」字，无「不」字。 今案此文当以「善」「不善」断句，道既含有万物庇荫之义，则「善」「不善」均在奥中。 惟人则不能无所选择，善为人之宝，故「宝而持之」，持之犹固执之也。 「不善，人之所不保」，以不善则为人所不附，庄子列御寇篇「人将保汝矣」，司马云：「保，附也。 」不保犹言人将不亲附之也。 美言可以市尊，行可以加人。 谦之案：傅本作「美言可以于市，尊言可以加于人」，范同，惟「言」作「行」，注云：「『于市』上疑脱一字。 」盖此文传写多误，傅、范本亦然。 淮南子人间训、道应训引并作「美言可以市尊，美行可以加人」，可据改正。 俞樾曰：按淮南子道应训、人间训引此文，是今本脱一「美」字是也。 惟人间训引「君子曰」，王念孙云：「『君子』本作『老子』，此浅学人改之也。 」今老子作「美言可以市，尊行可以加人」，无下「美」字，而以「市」字绝句，「尊」字下属为句。 道应篇引老子亦有下「美」字，则所见本异也。 谦之案：此文以「美言」与「美行」对文，又「尊」「人」二字，尊，文部，人，真部，此文、真通韵，宜从淮南。 人之不善，何弃之有？ 罗振玉曰：敦煌辛本「何」作「奚」。 「弃」，景龙本、敦煌庚本均作「弃」。 谦之案：遂州、顾欢、赵志坚本均作「奚」，顾本成疏：「奚，何也。 」意林诸本引并作「何」。 美言美行既见重于人，则不善者可以善者为师，而进至于善，故曰「何弃之有」。 故立天子，置三公，虽有拱○以先驷马，不如坐进此道。 武内义雄曰：「拱璧」，敦本作「供之璧」，「之」字恐衍。 又「驷马」作「四马」。 谦之案：左传襄十九年正义引老子曰：「虽有拱抱之璧以先驷马。 」「拱抱之璧」即王注所云「拱抱宝璧」也。 易顺鼎非之，谓：「左传襄三十一年『叔仲带窃其拱璧』，杜注：『拱璧，公大璧。 』玉篇：『珙，大璧也。 』『拱璧』即『珙璧』。 」今案：范本正作「珙璧」。 古之所以贵此道者何？ 不曰求以得，有罪以勉，故为天下贵。 严可均曰：「不日求以得」，河上、王弼「求」字在「以」字下，高翿「日」作「曰」。 「有罪以勉」，诸本作「以免邪」，高翿作「不免邪」。 罗振玉曰：敦煌庚本无「何」字，辛、壬本有之。 景龙、御注、敦煌庚、辛本均作「求以得」，王本、景福本作「以求得」。 庚本「得」下有「之」字。 又景龙本、敦煌辛本均无「也」字。",
      "translated_text": "「The Dao/Way is the repository [藏] of all things, containing nothing it does not embrace [無所不容也].」 *Péng Zhì* [彭耜]’s *Shìwén* [释文] states: *«\"Profound [奥],\"* from the pronunciation *Lǐ Wū-bào* [李乌报]. It says the Dao/Way’s essence has no external limit, while all things draw sustenance from within its profound depths [奧中].»* The *Sù Shū Jìjié Zhì* [隋书经籍志] states *«The Dao/Way is indeed the profound depths [奧] of all things»*, echoing this passage. Combining these two meanings, the Dao/Way is the profound depths [奧] of all things—that is, the source of their warmth and shelter.\n\n*Gāo Hēng* [高亨] explains: *«○, a hidden valley [藏谷], from [谷], bearing grains within its hollows [穴中].»* This is incorrect.\n\nThe *Zìjiàn* [字鉴] states: *«Profound [奥], pronounced *Yú-Dào* [于到], meaning \"deep\" [深], from [采] and [从]. Its sound is *gǒng* [拱], now written as 大 [大], a vulgar form. The middle component of the character is mistakenly from [米粟] (grain).»* The correct pronunciation is *gǒng* [拱], and the character should be understood as \"deep.\"\n\nGoodness [善] is the treasure [宝] of humankind; wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [人之所不保]. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] states: *«Wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [所不保]»*, though other versions read *«所保»*. *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Xīběn* [敦煌辛本] has *«不»* beneath *«所»*. *Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] argues that the *Dūn* [敦], *Jǐng* [景], and *Suì* [遂] versions all read *«所不保»*, and *«不»* may be a duplication. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] and *Zhào Zhìjiān* [赵志坚] also render it *«所不保»*, but with *«保»* as *«宝»*. *Yǐn Wénzǐ Dàdào Piān* [尹文子大道篇] cites *«wickedness [不善] is what humankind treasures [所宝]»*, where the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions have *«所»* but lack *«不»*. Today’s analysis: This passage should be punctuated as *«Goodness [善] / Wickedness [不善]»*, for the Dao/Way encompasses the sheltering [庇荫] of all things—both goodness and wickedness reside within its depths. Yet humans cannot remain indifferent; goodness is what humankind treasures, hence *«treasure it and uphold it»* [宝而持之], meaning to cling steadfastly to it. *«Wickedness [不善] is what humankind does not hold as treasure [所不保]»*—wickedness, then, is what humankind rejects and does not embrace. In *Zhuāngzǐ Liè Yùlǘu Piān* [庄子列御寇篇], *«人将保汝矣»*, *Sīmǎ* [司马] notes: *«保 [保], to attach oneself [附].»* Thus, *«不保»* means humankind will not attach itself to wickedness.\n\nFine words can be used to purchase honor [市尊], and virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [加人]. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: The *Fù* [傅] version reads *«Fine words can be used in the marketplace [美言可以于市], honorable words can enhance one’s standing [尊言可以加于人]»*, while the *Fàn* [范] version agrees, except *«言»* is replaced by *«行»*, with the note: *«Perhaps a character is missing above \"市 [marketplace]\".»*» This passage has been frequently miscopied, as seen in the *Fù* [傅] and *Fàn* [范] versions. The *Huáinánzǐ Rénjiān Xuàn* [淮南子人间训] and *Dàoyìng Xuàn* [道应训] both cite it correctly as *«Fine words can be used to purchase honor [美言可以市尊], virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [美行可以加人].»* Thus, the current version can be corrected accordingly. *Yú Tàoshuò* [俞樾] states: *«According to the *Huáinánzǐ Dàoyìng Xuàn* [淮南子道应训] and *Rénjiān Xuàn* [人间训], the current version is missing a \"美 [fine]\" character.»* However, the *Rénjiān Xuàn* [人间训] cites *«君子曰»*, and *Wáng Niǎnsūn* [王念孙] argues: *«君子 [Noble One] originally read \"老子 [Lǎozǐ],\" a superficial scholar’s alteration.»* Now, *Lǎozǐ* [老子] reads *«Fine words can be used to purchase honor [美言可以市], virtuous deeds can enhance one’s standing [尊行可以加人],»* without the *«美»* beneath *«行»*, and the sentence ends with *«市»*, with *«尊»* beginning the next. The *Dàoyìng Piān* [道应篇] also cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] with *«美»* beneath *«行»*, indicating the versions seen differ. *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: This passage pairs *«Fine words [美言]»* with *«Virtuous deeds [美行]»*, and *«尊 [honor]»* and *«人 [one’s standing]»* rhyme in *Zhēn* [真] and *Wén* [文] tones, aligning with the *Huáinánzǐ* [淮南子]’s poetic structure.\n\nWhy then is wickedness [不善] ever discarded? *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Xīběn* [敦煌辛本] reads *«奚 [deliberate]»* instead of *«何 [why]»*. *«弃 [discard]»* is rendered *«奚»* in the *Suìzhōu* [遂州], *Gùhuān* [顾欢], and *Zhào Zhìjiān* [赵志坚] versions, while the *Gù* [顾] version’s *Chéngshū* [成疏] states: *«奚 [deliberate], why [何].»* Other versions cite *«何 [why]»*. Since fine words and virtuous deeds are valued by humankind, wickedness can be transformed by learning from goodness, thus progressing toward virtue. Hence, it is said *«Why then is wickedness ever discarded [奚弃之有]?»*\n\nTherefore, even when establishing the Son of Heaven [立天子] and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers [置三公], though one may offer a *gǒngbì* [拱璧] (a ceremonial jade tablet) before four steeds [先驷马], it is not as valuable as advancing this Dao/Way. *Wǔnèi Yìxióng* [武内义雄] argues: *«拱璧 [gǒngbì]* is rendered as *«供之璧 [offer it as a jade tablet]»* in the *Dūn* [敦] version, and *«之»* may be a duplication. *«驷马 [four steeds]»* is also written as *«四马 [four steeds]».»* *Qiān Zhī* [谦之]’s analysis: The *Zuǒzhuan Xiāngshíjiǔnián Zhèngyì* [左传襄十九年正义] cites *Lǎozǐ* [老子] as *«Though one may offer a jade tablet held in both hands [拱抱之璧] to precede four steeds [以先驷马].»* *«拱抱之璧 [gǒngbì]* aligns with *Wáng Zhǔ* [王注]’s *«拱抱宝璧 [ceremonial jade tablet]».»* *Yì Shùndīng* [易顺鼎] rejects this, stating: *«In *Zuǒzhuan Xiāngsānshíyīnián* [左传襄三十一年], *\"Chú Zhòng Dài* [叔仲带] stole the ceremonial jade tablet [窃其拱璧],\"* and *Dù Zhù* [杜注] explains: *«拱璧 [gǒngbì], a grand jade tablet [公大璧].»* The *Yùpiān* [玉篇] states: *«珙 [gǒng], a grand jade tablet [大璧].»* Thus, *«拱璧 [gǒngbì]* is *«珙璧 [gǒngbì]».»* The *Fàn* [范] version correctly reads *«珙璧 [gǒngbì]».*\n\nWhy was the Dao/Way held in such esteem in antiquity? Not because it is sought and obtained [不曰求以得], nor because it wards off evil through effort [有罪以勉], but because it is thereby esteemed throughout the world [故为天下贵]. *Yán Kějūn* [严可均] states: *«不日求以得 [Not because it is sought and obtained]»*, where the *Héshàng* [河上] and *Wáng Bì* [王弼] versions place *«求 [seek]»* beneath *«以 [and]»*, and *Gāo Xiè* [高翿] renders *«日 [say]»* as *«曰 [say]»*. *«有罪以勉 [Wards off evil through effort]»* is written as *«以免邪 [to ward off evil]»* in other versions, while *Gāo Xiè* [高翿] renders it *«不免邪 [does not ward off evil]».* *Luó Zhènyù* [罗振玉] notes that the *Dūnhuáng Gēngběn* [敦煌庚本] lacks *«何 [why]»*, while the *Xīn* [辛] and *Rén* [壬] versions include it. The *Jǐnglóng* [景龙], *Yùzhù* [御注], *Dūnhuáng Gēng* [敦煌庚], and *Xīn* [辛] versions all read *«求以得 [seek and obtain]»*, while the *Wáng* [王] and *Jǐngfú* [景福] versions read *«以求得 [to seek and obtain]».* The *Gēng* [庚] version has *«之 [it]»* beneath *«得 [obtain]»*. Additionally, the *Jǐnglóng* [景龙] and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* [敦煌辛] versions lack *«也 [also]»*.",

Both terms speak of the realm of the world—simply put, it is only because one does not dare to lead the world that one can become its leader.\n\nLiu Shīpèi (刘师培) notes: The ancient texts have *\"wéichéngqìzhǎng\"* (为成器长) with the *\"wéi\"* (为) preserved. *\"Chéngqìzhǎng\"* (成器长) refers to a great official; *\"wéi\"* (为) means \"to reside.\" In antiquity, *\"gōng\"* (工) and *\"guān\"* (官) were interchangeable, so a great official was also called *\"chéngqìzhǎng.\"* The current text omits *\"wéi\"* (为), making it ungrammatical.\n\nYang Chūn (杨椿) says: The *Kūn* (坤) hexagram of the *Yì* (易) states: *\"Kūn, though supremely yielding, yet in action is strong.\"* Thus, the saying *\"obtain virtue and have courage\"* (得乎仁者有勇之说) arises, hence: *\"Palatial, thus able to be courageous.\"* The *Jiè* (节) hexagram states: *\"Moderation in institutions—no waste of resources, no harm to the people.\"* Thus, the saying *\"frugality suffices\"* (俭以足用之说) arises, hence: *\"Frugal, thus able to be broad.\"* The *Qiān* (谦) hexagram states: *\"Modest and yet illustrious, lowly yet uncrossable.\"* Thus, the saying *\"one virtue yields four benefits\"* (一谦而四益具之说) arises, hence: *\"Not daring to lead the world, thus able to become its great leader.\"* The *Yì* and the *Lǎozǐ* align like matching seals.\n\nIf one abandons *cí* (慈) for *yǒng* (勇), *jiǎn* (俭) for *guǎng* (广), and *hòu* (后) for *xiān* (先), then one is doomed.\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: In the *Yìzhù* (御注) and *Gāoxì* (高翿) versions, *\"shě\"* (舍) is followed by *\"qí\"* (其) in all three sentences. *\"Qiéxiān\"* (且先) is mistakenly reversed in the *Yìzhù*. Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Yìzhù* version and the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) text all have *\"qí\"* (其) after *\"shě\"* (舍). The *Yìzhù* version reverses *\"qiéxiān\"* (且先). According to Jiānzhī (谦之), the *Yán Zhūn* (严遵) text and the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) text both render the first *\"shě\"* (舍) as *\"shì\"* (释). The *Guǎngyáng* (广阳), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), *Zhào* (赵), *Gāoxì* (高翿), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), and *Héshàng* (河上) versions all use *\"shě\"* (舍), while the *Wáng Bì* (王弼) and *Fàn Yìngyuán* (范应元) versions also use *\"shě\"* (舍). *\"Sǐyǐ\"* (死矣), in the *Yán Zhūn* (严) text, is *\"zé sǐyǐ\"* (则死矣); in the *Yìzhù*, it is *\"qiě sǐyǐ\"* (且死矣); in the *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions, it is *\"shì wèi rù sǐmén\"* (是谓入死门).\n\nPalatiality: in war, it conquers; in defense, it holds firm. When Heaven is about to save it, it does so with palatiality as its shield.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes: The *Wáng* (王) text uses *\"zhàn\"* (战), matching the *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yìzhù* (御注), *Jǐngfú* (景福), and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions. The *Shìwén* (释文) omits *\"yǐ chén\"* (以陈), indicating the *Wáng* (王) text originally had *\"chén\"* (陈). The *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions also use *\"chén\"* (陈). *\"Tiān jiāng jiù zhī\"* (天将救之), in the *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions, has *\"yǐ shàn\"* (以善) after *\"zhī\"* (之). Wǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) states: The *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) versions read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则政). Jiānzhī (谦之) notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州) text reads *\"yǐ chén zé zhǐ\"* (以陈则止), where *\"zhǐ\"* (止) is a mistake for *\"zhèng\"* (正). The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) versions read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则正). Bì Yàn (毕沅) says: *\"Héshànggōng* (河上公) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) render it *\"cí yǐ zhàn zé shèng\"* (慈以战则胜), while *Hán Fēi* (韩非) renders it *\"cí yú zhàn zé shèng\"* (慈于战则胜). By meaning, it should be *\"chén\"* (陈). Additionally, in *Wáng Bì*’s (王弼) annotation: *\"Palatial in battle, thus victorious; in defense, thus steadfast—hence able to be courageous.\"* And again: *\"Confronting danger without retreat, thus victorious.\"* The *\"shèng\"* (胜) in the *Dàozàng Wáng* (道藏王) text is *\"zhèng\"* (正), proving the original *Wáng* (王) text also read *\"yǐ chén zé zhèng\"* (以陈则正).\n\n**Phonology:** Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme reading for this chapter: *yǒng* (勇), *guǎng* (广), *zhǎng* (长) (under *yáng* and *dōng* rhyme groups, with *yǒng* in *wǎng* sound). *Yǒng* (勇) belongs to the *dōng* department, while *guǎng* (广) and *zhǎng* (长) belong to the *yáng* department, thus *yáng* and *dōng* are harmonized. Xī Dòng (奚侗) agrees. Yáo Wéntián (姚文田) and Dèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) classify *guǎng* (广) and *zhǎng* (长) under the same rhyme. *\"Jiǔyǐ qí xì\"* (久矣其细), in the *Yán* (严) text, has *\"xiǎo\"* (小), with *xiào* (肖), *xiào* (肖), *xiào* (肖), *xiǎo* (小) rhyming. Wú Chē (吴棫) supplements the *Sānlìùshíliùyǎng* (三十六养): *\"Yǒng\"* (勇), pronounced *yùliǎng* (羽两切), meaning \"vigorous.\"\n\nThe *Lǎozǐ* states:\n*\"Palatial, thus able to be courageous;\nFrugal, thus able to be broad;\nNot daring to lead the world, thus able to become its great leader.\"*\n\n*Zhǎng* (长) is pronounced in the *shǎngshēng* (上声).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains 95 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version 97, the *Héshàng* (河上) version matches the *Jǐnglóng*, the *Wáng* (王) version has 99, the *Fù* (傅) version 105, and the *Fàn* (范) version 106. The *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *\"Sānbǎo Dìliùshíqī\"* (三宝第六十七), the *Wáng* (王) version *\"Liùshíqījiē\"* (六十七章), and the *Fàn* (范) version *\"Tiānxiàjiējué Dìliùshíqī\"* (天下皆谓章第六十七).\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight:**\n*\"The ancients who were skilled in being a gentleman did not rely on force.\"*\n\nYán Kějūn (严可均) notes: The phrase *\"gǔ zhī shàn wéi shì zhě\"* (古之善为士者) is absent in all versions. Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) versions both have *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之) at the sentence’s beginning. Wǔnèi Yìxióng (武内义雄) says: The *Dūn* (敦), *Suì* (遂), and *Jǐng* (景) versions all have *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之) at the start, as does the *Wáng Bì* (王弼) version. Jiānzhī (谦之) notes: All *Wáng* (王) versions lack *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之), except the *Mínghé* (明和) edition of *Lǎozǐ Wángzhù* (老子王注), which in its *kǎoyì* (考异) states: *\"The ancient text reads: 'Gǔ zhī shàn wéi shì zhě bù wǔ yě' (古之善为士者不武也).\"* This refers to the *Fù Yì* (傅奕) ancient text. Wǔnèi (武内) erred in his collation. Additionally, the *Gù* (顾) and *Fàn* (范) versions also include *\"gǔ zhī\"* (古之).",

According to this, *\"zhēng\"* (争) corresponds with *\"bù zhēng zhī dé\"* (不争之德) below, so it should indeed be *\"zhēng\"* (争).\n\nJiānzhī notes: Xíng Xuán (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gù* (顾), *Péng* (彭), *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Zhào* (赵), and *Gāo* (高) versions all read *\"bù zhēng\"* (不争). The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), *Xíng Xuán* (邢玄), *Gù* (顾), and *Zhào* (赵) versions, as well as the *Héshàng* (河上) version, lack *\"zhī\"* (之). Moreover, the *Pánxī* (磻溪) version renders *\"nù\"* (怒) as *\"shù\"* (恕), and the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) version substitutes *\"zhī\"* (之) with *\"tiān\"* (天), both errors.\n\nLiú Shīpéi states: *Wáng Bì* (王弼) renders *\"bù yǔ zhēng yě\"* (不与争也), but *\"yǔ\"* (与) should be *\"jǔ\"* (举), where *\"jǔ\"* (举) means to raise arms, akin to the abbreviated *\"bīng\"* (兵) in ancient texts like *\"dà jǔ\"* (大举).\n\nTáo Hóngqìng says: *Wáng Bì* (王弼) renders *\"bù yǔ zhēng\"* (不与争), yet only states *\"bù yǔ\"* (不与), omitting the crucial word entirely. *\"Yǔ\"* (与) is the same as *\"zhēng\"* (争). In the *Mòzǐ Fēi Rú Xià Piān* (墨子非儒下篇), it says: *\"If all were **virtuous** (rén) people, then they would vie without words\"* (若皆仁人也，则无说而相与), which aligns with the later *\"If they clash like torrents\"* (若雨暴交争) in meaning—here *\"xiāng yǔ\"* (相与) is the same as *\"xiāng zhēng\"* (相争). *Wáng Shì* (王氏) cites the *Jīngyì Shùwén* (经义述闻) to say: *\"In ancient times, 'correspond' (dāng) and 'oppose' (dí), were both called 'yǔ' (与).\"* The annotation and verification are most thorough. *\"Dāng\"* (当) and *\"dí\"* (敌) both share meaning with *\"zhēng\"* (争). It is likely the original annotation read *\"yǔ zhēng yě\"* (与争也). Later generations, failing to grasp its meaning, presumptuously added the *\"bù\"* (不) character.\n\nJiānzhī notes: Táo’s (陶) explanation is correct. The *Jīngyì Shùwén* (经义述闻) cites the *Hànshū Gāodì Jì* (汉书高帝纪): *\"I know how to oppose him\"* (吾知与之矣), where *\"yǔ\"* (与) means the same as *\"dí\"* (敌). Again, the *Shǐjì Yàn Shìjiā* (史记燕世家) says: *\"Páng Nuǎn is easy to oppose\"* (庞暖易与耳). The *Báiqǔ Jiàn* (白起传) says: *\"Lián Pó is easy to oppose\"* (廉颇易与). The *Huái'Yīn Hóu Zhuàn* (淮阴侯传) says: *\"I have always known that Hàn Xīn is easy to oppose\"* (吾生平知韩信为人易与耳). In ancient times, *\"yǔ\"* (与) meant to face an enemy. In the *Zuǒzhuàn Xiānggōng Èrshíwǔ Nián* (左传襄公二十五年), it says: *\"One against one, who could oppose me?\"* (一与一，谁能惧我？) Here, *\"yǔ\"* (与) is the same as *\"zhēng\"* (争). Láo Jiàn (劳健) and Gāo Hēng (高亨) also cite similar evidence. The current *Dàozàng Héshàng* (道藏河上) version reads *\"bù yǔ zhēng\"* (不与争), which carries greater meaning. *\"Yǔ\"* (与) rhymes with *\"wǔ\"* (武), *\"nù\"* (怒), and *\"xià\"* (下), whereas *\"zhēng\"* (争) does not. This is called the **virtue** (virtue) of non-vying, hence the power of employing people, and this is termed the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī).\n\nLuó Zhènyù states: The *Jǐngfú* (景福), *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚), and *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌壬) versions all have *\"jī\"* (极) followed by *\"yě\"* (也).\n\nWǔnèi Yìxióng says: *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天古之极), the *\"gǔ\"* (古) character is a redundant addition; Yú Yè (俞樾) in *Lǎozǐ Píngyì* (老子平议) has provided evidence for this.\n\nJiānzhī notes: The first sentence *\"This is called\"* (是谓), *Gù* (顾) renders as *\"This is why\"* (是以). The second sentence *\"This is why\"* (是以), the *Yán* (严) version lacks it entirely, while all other versions render it as *\"This is called\"* (是谓). Additionally, *Fù* (傅), *Fàn* (范), *Nǎi Juàn* (柰卷), and *Gù* (顾) versions all have *\"jī\"* (极) followed by *\"yě\"* (也). Yú Yè (俞樾) says: Each sentence in this chapter carries a rhyme. The first four sentences rhyme with *\"wǔ\"* (武), *\"nù\"* (怒), *\"yǔ\"* (与), and *\"xià\"* (下); the last three rhyme with *\"dé\"* (德), *\"lì\"* (力), and *\"jī\"* (极). If *\"This is called the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (是谓配天) is taken as a sentence, it lacks rhyme, so *\"gǔ\"* (古) is likely a redundant addition. *\"This is called the **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (是谓配天之极) as a six-character sentence aligns with the structure of *\"This is called the **virtue** (virtue) of non-vying\"* (是谓不争之德) and *\"This is called the power of employing people\"* (是谓用人之力). The redundant *\"gǔ\"* (古) character, being synonymous with *\"tiān\"* (天), is an error. The *Zhōushū Zhōu Zhù Piān* (周书周祝篇) says: *\"**Heaven** (Tiān) is the ancient\"* (天为古). The *Shàngshū Yáo Diǎn* (尚书尧典) says *\"If one examines the ancient **Heaven** (Tiān) of Emperor Yáo\"* (若稽古帝尧), and the *Zhèng Zhù* (郑注) states: *\"Ancient, meaning **Heaven** (Tiān).\"* Thus *\"gǔ\"* (古) and *\"tiān\"* (天) share the same meaning. In this **sutra** (sutra), *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in antiquity’s ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天之极) may appear in other versions as *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching the ancient in ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配古之极), but later scribes mistakenly merged them. Jiānzhī notes: Yú’s (俞) explanation also appears in *Gǔshū Yíyì Lì* (古书疑义举例五) under *\"Two characters with the same meaning and redundant addition,\"* and his reasoning is sound. The *Ěryǎ Shìgǔ* (尔雅释诂) defines *\"jī\"* (极) as *\"reaching its utmost\"* (至也). The *Shījìng Sōnggāo* (诗嵩高) says *\"Swiftly reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (骏极于天), and the *Zhuàn* (传) explains: *\"Reaching its utmost\"* (至也). The *Lǐjì Lèjì* (礼记乐记) says *\"Reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān) and curling around the earth\"* (极乎天而蟠于地), and the *Zhù* (注) states: *\"Reaching its utmost\"* (至也). *\"The **Dao** (Way) of matching **Heaven** (Tiān) in ultimate **extreme** (jī)\"* (配天之极) shares a similar meaning with *\"Swiftly reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (骏极于天) and *\"Reaching the utmost of **Heaven** (Tiān)\"* (极乎天). *\"Pèi\"* (配) means *\"to harmonize\"* (合也). In the *Zhuāngzǐ Tiāndì Piān* (庄子天地篇), it says: *\"Emperor Yáo asked Xǔyóu: 'Can **Nǐèmiè** (啮缺) harmonize with **Heaven** (Tiān)?’\"* (尧问于许由曰：「啮缺可以配天乎？」）, and the *Chéngshū* (成疏) explains: *\"Harmonize, meaning to match.

However, it reads *\"**‘kàng bīng xiāng rú’**\"* (抗兵相如), where *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如) is the correct character, and *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) likely arose from a shape-based error with *\"**‘rú’**\"*.

Wáng Bì’s (王弼) annotation states: *\"**‘Kàng’**\"* (抗) means **‘to confront or raise’** (举), and *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) means **‘to meet or clash’** (当). Referring to the *Zhàn Guó Cé* (战国策): *\"**‘Fú Sòng zhī bù rú Liáng yě’**\"* (夫宋之不如梁也), Gāo Zhù (高注) explains: *\"**‘Rú’**\"* (如) means **‘to meet or clash’** (当).

Thus, these two characters have long been subject to mutual scribal errors.\n\nThe origin of the erroneous *\"**‘jiā’**\"* (加) lies in its being mistaken for *\"**‘rú’**\"* (如). Today’s annotators mostly follow the erroneous text, interpreting it as *\"**‘clashing armies’**\"*, thereby missing its true intent.\n\nYú Yì (俞樾) argues: *\"**‘Āi’**\"* (哀) lacks meaning and is likely a miswriting for *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄). The *Shǐjì* (史记) states: *\"Liáng Huì zú, Xiāng Wáng lì, Xiāng Wáng zú, Āi Wáng lì\"* (梁惠卒，襄王立，襄王卒，哀王立). According to the *Zhúshū Jìnián* (竹书纪年), there was no *\"**‘Āi Wáng’**\"* (哀王), and Gù Shì’s (顾氏) *Rì Zhī Lù* (日知录) notes that *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) and *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) are visually similar, with the *Shǐjì* mistakenly splitting them into two individuals. Additionally, the *Qín Āi Gōng* (秦哀公) and *Chén Āi Gōng* (陈哀公) in the *Shǐjì*’s *\"Shíèr Zhūhòu Niánbiǎo\"* (十二诸侯年表) are all recorded as *\"**‘Xiāng Gōng’**\"* (襄公), proving that these two characters have long been confused. *\"**‘Xiāng’**\"* (襄) is a substitute for *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让). The *Zhōu Guān Bǎoshì Zhí* (周官保氏职) *Zhèng Shū* (郑注) on *\"**‘xiāng chǐ’**\"* (襄尺) has the *Shìwén* (释文) stating: *\"**‘Xiāng yīn ràng, běnzuò ràng’**\"* (襄音让，本作让), meaning *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) and *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让) were interchangeable in antiquity. The earlier passage states: *\"**‘Wú bù gǎn wéi zhǔ ér wéi kè, wú bù gǎn jìn cùn ér tuì chǐ’**\"* (吾不敢为主而为客，吾不敢进寸而退尺), which embodies *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让). Thus, it is said: *\"**‘Kàng bīng xiāng jiā, ràng zhě shèng yǐ’**\"* (抗兵相加，让者胜矣). The character *\"**‘xiāng’**\"* (襄) was used as a substitute for *\"**‘ràng’**\"* (让), then mistakenly written as *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀), causing scholars to lose the correct interpretation.\n\nYú’s (俞) explanation is convoluted, and though Wǔnèi Yìyǒng (武内义雄) follows it, it alters the text to interpret the scripture. Yì Shùndìng (易顺鼎) argues: *\"**‘Āi’**\"* (哀) is the same as *\"**‘ài’**\"* (爱), as ancient characters were interchangeable. The *\"Shī Xù\"* (诗序) states: *\"**‘Āi yǎotiǎo ér bù yín qí sè’**\"* (哀窈窕而不淫其色), where *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) should be read as *\"**‘ài’**\"* (爱). Thus, *\"**‘Kàng bīng xiāng jiā, āi zhě shèng’**\"* (抗兵相加，哀者胜) aligns with the earlier chapter’s *\"**‘cí, yǐ zhàn zé shèng yě’**\"* (慈，以战则胜也).\n\nJiǎng Xīchāng (蒋锡昌) states: The *\"Shuōwén Jiězì\"* (说文解字) defines *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) as *\"**‘mǐn’**\"* (闵), which corresponds to *\"**‘cí’**\"* (慈) in Chapter 67. This passage speaks of two sides confronting each other in battle, with the result that the compassionate side will prevail—just as Chapter 67 states: *\"**‘Cí, yǐ zhàn zé shèng’**\"* (慈，以战则胜). Both interpretations are plausible.\n\nFurther evidence comes from Chapter 31: *\"**‘Shā rén duō, yǐ bēi’āi lì zhī, zhàn shèng, yǐ āi lǐ chǔ zhī’**\"* (杀人多，以悲哀莅之，战胜，以哀礼处之), all of which are precise ancient military teachings. Thus, the character *\"**‘āi’**\"* (哀) is not erroneous.\n\n---\n**[Phonology]**\nJiāng Shì’s (江氏) rhyme reading for this chapter follows the *\"Kè, chǐ\"* (客、尺) rhyme (Yú department, *chǐ* and *chǔ* as entering tones), *\"xíng, bīng\"* (行、兵) rhyme (Yáng department), and *\"bì, dí\"* (臂、敌) rhyme (Zhī department). He rearranges the *\"**‘zhí wú bīng’**\"* (执无兵) clause above *\"**‘réng wú dí’**\"* (仍无敌). This is correct.\n\nHowever, the *Dūn* (敦) and *Suì* (遂) manuscripts read *\"**‘zhí wú bīng, réng wú dí’**\"* (执无兵，仍无敌), as does the *Yán* (严) manuscript. Here, *\"**‘xíng, bīng, bì, dí’**\"* (行、兵、臂、敌) alternate as rhymes. Jiāng’s (江) rearrangement—*\"**‘xíng wú xíng, zhí wú bīng, rǎng wú bì, rēng wú dí’**\"* (行无行，执无兵，攘无臂，扔无敌)—though closer, still fails to capture the alternating rhyme’s elegance. Yáo Wéntián (姚文田), adhering to the original, takes *\"**‘xíng, bīng’**\"* (行、兵) as rhyming and argues that *\"**‘bì, dí’**\"* (臂、敌) naturally harmonize, which is still inferior to Jiāng’s (江) approach.\n\nAdditionally, *\"**‘xíng’**\"* (行) is pronounced *\"**‘háng’**\"* (杭) in the lower clause. Dèng Tíngzhēn (邓廷桢) notes that *\"**‘kè, chǐ’**\"* (客、尺) form a rhyme in the *Yú* and *Yú* departments as entering tones. *\"**‘Kè’**\"* (客), with the *\"gè\"* (各) tone, belonged to the ancient *Yù* department, rhyming with *\"**‘mò, shù, dù, cuò’**\"* (莫、庶、度、错) in the *\"Chǔ Cí\"* (楚茨). *\"**‘Chǐ’**\"* (尺), in ancient pronunciation, also belonged to the *Yù* department, rhyming with *\"**‘bó, dù’**\"* (柏、度) in the *\"Mǐn Gōng\"* (閟宫). Jiāng Yǒuguì (江有诰) in *\"Táng Yùn Sìshēng Zhèng Èrshísān Xí\"* (唐韵四声正二十四锡) states: *\"**‘Dí’**\"* (敌) is pronounced *\"**‘tú lì qiè’**\"* (徒历切). According to ancient usage, it had a departing tone, aligning with the *Zhì* department. In *Lǎozǐ Xuányòng Piān* (老子玄用篇), *\"**‘réng’**\"* (仍) rhymes with *\"**‘dí’**\"* (敌) and *\"**‘bì’**\"* (臂).\n\nThe *Yòujīnglóng Bēi* (右景龙碑本) contains 54 characters, the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) manuscript 55, the *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng* (王) manuscripts 54, the *Fù* (傅) manuscript 57, and the *Fàn* (范) manuscript 58. The *Héshàng* (河上) manuscript is titled *\"Xuányòng dì liùshíjiǔ\"* (玄用第六十九), the *Wáng* (王) manuscript *\"Liùshíjiǔ\"* (六十九章), and the *Fàn* (范) manuscript *\"Yòngbīng zhě yǒu yán zhāng dì liùshíjiǔ\"* (用兵者有言章第六十九).\n\n---\n**Chapter 70**\n*\"Wú yán shèn yì zhī, shèn yì xíng.\"* (吾言甚易知，甚易行)",

Gu Yanwu’s *Tangyun Zheng* (唐韵正, Vol. 43, *Ying* 映): *“Bìng”* (病) in ancient times had the *ping* (平) tone, *yang* (阳) rhyme, citing this chapter from *Lǎozǐ*.

According to ancient usage, *shàng* (上) had a *ping* (平) tone and should be grouped with the *yang* (阳) rhyme. This character appears only in the *Zhōu Shū* (周书) proverb *“Mín wù qí shàng”* (民恶其上, “The people detest their ruler”), where it rhymes with *“wǎng”* (网, “net”) in the *shàngshēng* (上声) tone. In *Lǎozǐ*’s *“Xuányòng Piān”* (玄用篇—*Jiànzhī’àn* [谦之案]: likely a misattribution to *“Zhībìng Piān”* [知病篇]), *“zhī bùzhī shàng”* (知不知上) rhymes with *bìng* (病) in the *qùshēng* (去声) tone; no other instances read *shàng* (上) or *bìng* (病) in *shàngshēng* or *qùshēng*.\n\nThe **Jìnglóng Shìbēn** (景龙碑本) and **Dūnhuáng Běn** (敦煌本) contain **22 characters**; the **Héshàng Běn** (河上本) and **Wáng Běn** (王本) contain **28 characters**; the **Fù Běn** (傅本) and **Fàn Běn** (范本) contain **32 characters**.

The **Héshàng Běn** omits *“zé”* but adds *“yǐ”* (矣) at the end. **Wèi Jiàosūn** (魏稼孙) states that the *Yùzhù* reads *“rén”* (人) instead of *“mín”* (民). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes that the **Dūnhuáng Gēngběn** (敦煌庚本) reads *“dà wèi zhì yǐ”* (大畏至矣), while the **Rénběn** (壬本) and **Jǐngfú Běn** (景福本) read *“dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (大威至矣). **Takuchi Kaichō** (武内义雄) observes that the **Dūn** (敦) and **Suì** (遂) manuscripts place *“zé”* (则) at the start of the second clause but omit *“yǐ”* (矣) at the end. **Jiànzhī’àn** (谦之案): The **Guāngmíng Běn** (广明本) reads *“zé dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (则大威至矣), matching **Péng**, **Fù**, and **Fàn** versions. The **Nǎi Juàn** (柰卷) reads *“dà wēi zhì yǐ”* (大威至矣), while the **Luó Juàn** (罗卷) reads *“bù wèi wēi, mín bù wèi wēi”* (不畏威，民不畏威). Anciently, *“wèi”* (畏) and *“wēi”* (威) were interchangeable. **Gāo Hēng** (高亨) explains *“zhì”* (至) as *“obstructed”* (碍止): *“If the people do not fear authority, then the ruler’s power is obstructed and cannot prevail”—a warning to those who would wield authority. The next lines *“wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng”* (无狭其所居，无厌其所生) explicitly forbid the use of coercive power.\n\n---\n**Wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng.**\n(Yán Kějūn notes: **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders *“wú xiá”* (无狭) as *“wú xiá”* (无狎). **Luó Zhènyù** states that the **Jìnglóng**, *Yùzhù*, **Jǐngfú**, **Dūnhuáng Gēng**, **Xīn**, and **Rén** manuscripts all read *“xiá”* (狭) instead of *“xiá”* (狎). **Jiànzhī’àn**: **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Guāngmíng**, **Qìngyáng**, **Pánxī**, **Lóuzhèng**, **Nǎi Juàn**, **Héshàng**, **Gāo Yì**, **Yán**, **Gù**, **Péng**, and **Zhào** versions all read *“xiá”* (狭)—(Jiǎng Xíchāng’s annotated **Yán** version reads *“jiá”* (挟), but the **Yílán Táng** edition of **Yán** also reads *“xiá”* (狭)). The **Fù** and **Fàn** versions read *“xiá”* (狎); *“xiá”* (狭) is correct. The **Dàozàng**’s **Sòng Zhāng Tàishǒu** (宋张太守) collated **Sìjiā Zhù** (四家注) cites **Wáng Bì**’s annotation: *“Wú xiá qí suǒ jū, wú yàn qí suǒ shēng—speaking of how coercive power should not be wielded.”* Again, under *“zì ài bù zì guì”* (自爱不自贵), it cites **Wáng Bì**’s annotation: *“If one esteems oneself, others will feel constrained in their dwellings and livelihoods.”* It is likely that **Wáng Bì**’s original also read *“xiá”* (狭). **Bì Yùn** (毕沅) doubted the existence of *“xiá”* (狭) in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字). **Xí Dòng** states: *“Xiá”* (狭) is the *“shǎn”* (陕) character in the *Shuōwén*—meaning *“narrow”* (隘), with connotations of *“oppression”* (迫). *“Yàn”* (厌) in the *Shuōwén*: *“A basket”* (笮). This passage warns rulers: *“Do not oppress the people’s dwellings, lest they find no comfort; do not exhaust their livelihoods, lest they find no ease.”*\n\n---\n**Fú wéi bù yàn, shìyǐ bù yàn.**\n(**Jiànzhī’àn**: The two *“bù”* (不) characters in the **Fù** and **Fàn** versions are rendered *“wú”* (无). The *“yàn”* (厌) character appears as *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Yùzhù*, **Fàn**, and **Xià Cōng**’s *Gǔwén Sìshēng Yùn*—the first two *“yàn”* (厌) are incorrect, while the latter is correct. Anciently, *“yàn”* (厌) in *“yàn yù”* (厌饫) and *“yàn zēng”* (厌憎) was written *“yàn”* (厌), while *“yàn”* (厌) in *“pò bī”* (迫逼) was written *“yàn”* (厌)—(see **Dèng Tíngzhēn**’s *Shuāngyàn Zhāi Bǐjì* [双砚斋笔记], Vol. 4). In this chapter, the latter *“yàn”* (厌) is correct, while the first two are both *“yàn”* (厌). In **Chapter 53**, *“yàn yǐnshí”* (厌饮食), and **Chapter 66**, *“shìyǐ tiānxià lè tuī ér bù yàn”* (是以天下乐推而不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is also used. **Wú Chéng**’s version renders the first *“yàn”* (厌) as *“xiá”* (狎), which is incorrect. **Wú** states: *“‘Bù xiá’* (不狎), the old text reads *“bù yàn”* (不厌). **Lúlíng Liú Shì** (庐陵刘氏) says: *“The first *“bù yàn”* (不厌) should be *“bù xiá”* (不狎).”* I follow this. *“Fú wéi bù xiá qí suǒ jū ér wèi suǒ wèi, shìyǐ bù yàn qí suǒ shēng, ér dà kě wèi zhě bù zhì yǐ.”* His reasoning fails to distinguish the two meanings of *“yàn”* (厌), arbitrarily altering the text. The first *“yàn”* (厌) and the latter *“yàn”* (厌), though now homophonous, originally differed in pronunciation and meaning. The first *“yàn”* (厌) means *“to press down”* (压); the latter *“yàn”* (厌) means *“to detest”* (恶). The four-tone evolution of *“yàn”* (厌) is clearly documented—(see **Gù Yánwù**’s *Tangyun Zheng* [唐韵正], Vol. 29, *Yè* 叶). *“Fú wéi bù yàn”* (夫唯不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is *“yì yàn”* (益涉切), an *rùshēng* (入声) tone. *“Shìyǐ bù yàn”* (是以不厌), *“yàn”* (厌) is *“yú yàn”* (于艳切), a *qùshēng* (去声) tone. The *Shìwén Jiě* (释文) records *“yàn”* (厌) as *“yú yàn”* (于艳反). Thus, it recognizes only the latter *“yàn”* (厌) but fails to acknowledge the two preceding *“yàn”* (厌) characters, obscuring the *Lǎozǐ*’s original intent.",

Thus, *“Fú wéi bù yàn”* (夫唯不厌) should be read as *“Fú wéi bù yā”* (夫唯不压)—“**Pressing down** is not done.”\n\nThe latter *“yàn”* (厌), pronounced *“yú yàn”* (于艳切), aligns with the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Lúnyǔ* (论语) *“Xué ér bù yàn”* (学而不厌)—“**learning without disdain**”—as well as the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Dà Sītú* (大司徒) commentary of the *Zhōulǐ* (周礼) *“yǒu yàn”* (有嫌厌)—“**disdainful**”—and the *“yàn”* (厌) in the *Huáinán Zǔ* (淮南子) *“Zhǔshù Piān”* (主术篇): *“Thus, the ruler and subjects, though long together, do not **disdain** (厌) each other.”*\nThe meaning here is that the **Dao/Way** of the **sage** (圣人) is one of **virtue/power** (德) without **pressing down** (压) or **restraining** (笮) governance, and thus the people do not **disdain** (恶) it either. Therefore, the **sage** (圣人) **knows himself** (自知) without **self-display** (不自见), **loves himself** (自爱) without **self-exalting** (不自贵). Hence, the text shifts from *“yàn”* (厌) as **press down/restrain** to *“yàn”* (厌) as **disdain**.\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) notes: *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) is written as *“gù”* (故) in the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Xīn* (辛) manuscript. **My examination** (谦之案) confirms that the *Shuòzhōu* (遂州) version also uses *“gù”* (故). The *Fù* (傅) and *Fàn* (范) manuscripts both insert *“ér”* (而) before *“bù”* (不). The phrase *“Qù bǐ qǔ cǐ”* (去彼取此) also appears in **Chapter 13** and **Chapter 38**, as well as in the *Huáinán Zǔ*’s *Dàoyìng Xuàn* (道应训) citation.\n\n**[Phonology]** This chapter lacks rhyme in Jiāng Shì’s (江氏) readings. **Gāo Běn Hàn** (高本汉) classifies it under the *Wēi* (威) and *Zhì* (至) rhymes. **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) assigns it to *Zēngzhī* (增知), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) rhymes. **My examination** (谦之案) aligns with *Yán Kějūn*’s (严可均) *Shuōwén Shēnglèi* (说文声类), which places *“yàn”* (厌) under the *Zhì* (至) and *Wēi* (威) rhymes in the *Zhǐ* (脂) category. *Wáng Niànsūn*’s (王念孙) *Gǔyùn Pǔ* (古韵谱) groups *Wēi* (威), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) under *Zhǐ* (脂), while *Zhì* (至) is merged into *Zhǐ* (脂) and *Zhì* (至) categories. *“Zhī”* (知), an *rùshēng* (入声) word in the *Zhī* (支) category, means that not only *Wēi* (威) and *Zhì* (至) form a rhyme, but *Wēi* (威), *Zhì* (至), *Zhī* (知), *Ài* (爱), and *Guì* (贵) actually constitute a **merged rhyme** (支、脂合韵) of *Zhī* (支) and *Zhǐ* (脂).\n\nThe *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) stele version contains **44 characters**; the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) version matches it.

The *Héshàng* (河上) version is titled *“Ài jǐ dì qīshíèr”* (爱己第七十二), the *Wáng* (王) version as *“Qīshíèr zhāng”* (七十二章), and the *Fàn* (范) version as *“Mín bù wèi wēi zhāng dì qīshíèr”* (民不畏威章第七十二).\n\n---\n**Chapter 73**\nThe **Dao/Way** of **courage** (勇) in daring is to **kill** (杀), while the **Dao/Way** of **courage** (勇) in not daring is to **sustain life** (活). **Knowing** (知) these two—whether they bring **benefit** (利) or **harm** (害)—is essential.\nWhat the **Heavenly** (天) **Dao/Way** **disdains** (恶), who can **fathom its reason** (故)?\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *“Zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (知此两者) lacks *“zhī”* (知) in the *Héshàng* (河上) and *Wáng Bì* (王弼) versions. Below the sentence *“Shú zhī qí gù”* (孰知其故), all other manuscripts include *“Shìyǐ shèngrén yóu nán zhī”* (是以圣人犹难之)—“Therefore, even the **sage** (圣人) finds it difficult.”\n\nLuó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Yùzhù* (御注), and *Jǐngfú* (景福) versions all read *“Zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (知此两者), while the *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Gēng* (庚) and *Rén* (壬) manuscripts render it *“Cháng zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (常知此两者)—“**constantly knowing** these two.”\n\n**My examination** (谦之案) confirms that the *Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Shuòzhōu* (遂州) versions also omit *“Shìyǐ shèngrén yóu nán zhī”* (是以圣人犹难之). The *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Rén* (壬) versions write *“shā”* (杀) as *“○”* (空). The *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gāo Yè* (高翿), and *Nǎi* (柰) volumes read *“Zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (知此两者), while *Yán Zūn* (严遵) and *Jǐngfú* (景福) render it *“Cháng zhī cǐ liǎng zhě”* (常知此两者). The *Huáinán Zǔ*’s *Dàoyìng Xuàn* (道应训) citation matches the second sentence, and the *Rénjiān Xuàn* (人间训) states: *“One may be **courageous** (勇) in daring, yet still fail to be **courageous** (勇) in not daring.”* The *Lièzǐ* (列子) *“Lìmìng Piān”* (力命篇) also quotes this chapter: *“Lǎo Dān (老聃) spoke to Guān Yǐn (关尹): ‘What the **Heavenly** (天) **Dao/Way** **disdains** (恶), who can **fathom its reason** (故)?’ He meant that **aligning with** (迎) **Heaven’s intent** (天意) and **gauging** (揣) **benefit/harm** (利害) is not as good as **letting it be** (不如其已).” All these passages derive from this chapter.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) appears in other versions but should be deleted, following the stele version. **Mǎ Xùlún** (马叙伦) asserts: *“Shìyǐ”* (是以) is an **erroneous repetition** (错简复出) from **Chapter 63**; the *Yìzhōu* (易州) version lacks it, confirming this.\n\n---\nThe **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** (天) does not **strive** (争) yet **conquers through virtue** (善胜), does not **speak** (言) yet **responds harmoniously** (善应), does not **summon** (召) yet **comes of its own accord** (自来), and **spontaneously** (繟) **plans with virtue** (善谋).\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) notes: *“Bù zhào ér lái, rán ér shàn móu”* (不召而来，然而善谋) has *“lái”* (来) followed by an **uninscribed character** (未刻). The *Yùzhù* (御注), *Wáng Bì* (王弼), and *Gāo Yè* (高翿) versions write *“繟”* (繟), while the *Shìwén* (释文) cites *Liáng Wáng Shàng* (梁王尚), *Zhōng Huì* (锺会), *Sūn Dēng* (孙登), and *Zhāng Sì* (张嗣) as rendering *“繟tán”* (繟坦) and *Héshàng* (河上) as *“墠”* (墠). Luó Zhènyù (罗振玉) states: *“Shìwén”* (释文) records: *“墠 (墠), ‘Tán’ (坦) is the reading of Liáng Wáng Shàng (梁王尚), Zhōng Huì (锺会), Sūn Dēng (孙登), and Zhāng Sì (张嗣).”* The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) *Gēng* (庚) version also uses *“tán”* (坦), while the *Xīn* (辛) and *Rén* (壬) versions read *“bùyán”* (不言)—“does not speak.”\n\n**My examination** (谦之案) finds that both *“繟”* (繟) and *“坦”* (坦) appear in the text; the stele version leaves a **blank space** (空一格) for an **unclear character** (何字不明). The *Yán* (严), *Péng* (彭), and *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之) versions use *“tán”* (坦), while the *Nǎi* (柰) volume renders *“繟”* (繟). **Fāng Yǐzhì** (方以智) states: *“繟tán”* (繟坦) and *“tánrán”* (坦然) and *“dànrán”* (啴然) are **interchangeable** (互通). **Jiāo Shì Yì** (焦氏翼) notes: *“繟tán”* (繟坦) is pronounced *“jiǎn”* (阐); *Wáng* (王) reads *“tán”* (坦), *Yán* (严) reads *“mò”* (默), but *“bùrú”* (不如) with *“繟”* (繟) is the **longer reading** (为长).” **My examination** (智按) finds that *Wáng Fǔsì*’s (王辅嗣) annotation also uses *“tánrán”* (坦然) and is acceptable. *“Dān”* (单) and *“dàn”* (亶) were **anciently interchangeable** (古通), just as *“zhuǎn”* (嬗) and *“chán”* (禅) or *“niáng”* (儃) and *“dàn”* (啴). *“Dàn”* (啴) shares the pronunciation of *“dān”* (单) and *“shàn”* (善), meaning **gentle** (缓); its sound *“dàn”* (啴) conveys **gentleness** (缓), hence the Tang usage of *“dànrán”* (啴然)—“**spontaneously gentle**.” (from *Tōngyǎ* (通雅) Vol. 8) **Lú Wénpián** (卢文弨) remarks: *“繟”* (繟), *“tán”* (坦), and *“wán”* (墠) share **similar pronunciations** (音相近) and may be **interchangeably used** (得通用).",

The *Shīmíng* (释名) states: *“Hài* (害), to cut—like cutting or carving things.” It also corresponds to *“hé”* (曷), as in *Mèngzǐ* (孟子): *“Shí rì hài sàng?”* (时日害丧?). The *“hài”* (害) in Chapter Thirty-Five of the *Jīng* (经) is pronounced with a departing tone, rhyming with *tài* (太). Here, *“hài”* (害) is an entering tone, rhyming with *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活). Jiāng Yǒuhuì’s *Tángyùn Sìshēng Zhèng* (唐韵四声正) states *“hài”* (害) is *“húgài”* (胡盖切). Anciently, there was an entering tone for *“hài”* (害), which should be grouped with the *Hé* (曷) department. In *Lǎozǐ* (老子) *Rènwéi* (任为篇): *“Cǐ liǎng zhě huò lì huò hài”* (此两者或利或害), *“hài”* (害) rhymes with *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活). Dèng Tíngzhēn states: *“Shā* (杀), *huó* (活), and *hài* (害) form a rhyme. *“Hài”* (害) belongs to the *Jì* (祭) Department, while *shā* (杀) and *huó* (活) are its entering-tone variants.

Examining *«qín»* (芹), which bears the radical *«jǐn»* (斤) and the phonetic *«○»* (○), the current text omits the *«shēng»* (声) character—this must have been deleted by *Xú Dǐngchén* (徐鼎臣).\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) states: *«○»* (○), a vessel for wine, its form resembling that of a wine vessel. This is the *«dǒu»* (斗) in the *Máo Shī* (毛诗) *«zhào yǐ dà dǒu»* (酌以大斗). *«Dǒu»* (斗) is a borrowed character; *«○»* (○) is the proper one.

The *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life, the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱者生之徒，坚强者死之徒). The *Yùlǎn Mùbù* (御览木部) reads *«The soft and frail are destined for life, the strong and rigid are destined for death»* (柔弱生之徒，刚强死之徒). All place *«the strong and rigid»* (坚强) sentence below *«the soft and frail»* (柔弱) sentence, suggesting that the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text may have followed this order. Thus, *«strong armies perish, rigid trees are felled»* (兵强则不胜，木强则折).\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** case notes: *«Rigid trees are felled»* (木则折) is rendered *«trees are felled»* (木则共) in the *Imperial Commentary* (御注), *Jǐnglóng* (景龙), *Xíngshàng* (邢玄), *Pánxī* (磻溪), *Lóuzhèng* (楼正), *Gāo Yì* (高翿), *Nǎi Juàn* (柰卷), *Héshàng* (河上), *Wáng Xīzhī* (王羲之), *Gǔ* (顾), *Fàn* (范), *Péng* (彭), *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚), and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions. The *Zhūwáng* (诸王) editions render *«armies»* (兵), while the *Dàozàng Wáng* (道藏王) edition renders *«are felled»* (折). The *Jīngxùn Táng Fù* (经训堂傅) edition renders *«armies»* (兵), while the *Dàozàng Fù* (道藏傅) edition renders *«are felled»* (共). The meaning of *«共»* (共) remains unclear.\n\nThe *Běnchéng Shū* (本成疏) states: *«Like trees that split apart when divided, their branches and twigs press down upon them; or like grand beams and pillars, where rafters and tiles press down upon them»* (譬树木分，故枝条共压其上； 亦犹梁栋宏壮，故椽瓦共压其上也). Thus, it is known that the edition *Běnchéng* (本成) saw also renders *«are felled»* (共).\n\n**Dīng Zhòngyòu** (丁仲佑) said: *«共»* (共) is a contracted form of *«拱»* (gōng, \"to arch or embrace\"), as seen in the *Jíyùn* (集韵). The *Gǔliáng* (谷梁) commentary on *Lǐsānshí Sānnián* (僖三十三年) states: *«拱,合抱也»* (\"*Gōng*, to embrace with both arms.\"), and the *Gōngyáng* (公羊) commentary also notes: *«拱,可以手对抱»* (\"*Gōng*, to embrace with hands clasped.\"). Though this explanation can be understood, *«trees are felled»* (木则兵) still aligns better with the saying *«the straight tree is felled first»* (直木先伐), making the latter meaning more plausible.\n\n**Huáng Màocái** (黄茂材) said: *«Lièzǐ* (列子) records the words of *Lǎodān* (老聃): *«Strong armies perish, rigid trees are felled»* (兵则灭，木则折). The *Lièzǐ* (列子) text largely follows the teachings of *Lǎozǐ* (老子), and its era is not distant from his. *«Rigid trees are felled»* (木则折) is a natural phrasing. Now, *«共»* (共) is rendered as *«拱»* (gōng), which does not make sense—*Lièzǐ* (列子) should be considered authoritative.»\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** case notes: **Huáng**’s (黄) explanation is correct. *«灭»* (miè, \"perish\") and *«折»* (zhé, \"fell\") form a rhyme. *«折»* (zhé) in seal script is written as ○, and appears under the *Cǎo* (艹) radical in the *Shuōwén* (说文). **Chén Zhù** (陈柱) said: *«In ancient texts, 『折』 (zhé) may sometimes be written as ○, as its seal form is extremely close to that of 『兵』 (bīng).」*\n\n**Gāo Hēng** (高亨) also stated: *«Ancient 『折』 (zhé) was sometimes written as ○, with 『斤』 (jīn) above and 『艹』 (cǎo) below, resembling 『兵』 (bīng) in form, hence the confusion.»*\n\n**Yú Yì** (俞樾) noted: *«木则兵»* (木则兵) is difficult to interpret, and the *Héshàng* (河上) edition’s *«木则共»* (木则共) is even more so. The original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text likely read *«木则折»* (木则折), but the *«折»* (zhé) character was damaged, leaving only its right radical *«斤»* (jīn), which, combined with the preceding *«兵则不胜»* (兵则不胜), led to its misinterpretation as *«兵»* (bīng). *«共»* (共) is further confusion from *«兵»* (bīng). The *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) cites *Lǎodān* (老聃) as saying *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), which can be used to correct this passage.\n\n**Yì Shùndǐng** (易顺鼎) added: **Yú**’s (俞) balanced analysis, citing *Lièzǐ* (列子) and the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text as *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), is correct. **Dǐng** (鼎) further notes that the *Wénzǐ Dàoyuán Piān* (文子道原篇) reads *«兵即灭，木即折»* (兵即灭，木即折), and the *Huáinán Yuándào Xuàn* (淮南原道训) also reads *«兵则灭，木则折»* (兵则灭，木则折), all consistent with *Lièzǐ* (列子). **Wáng**’s (王) annotation of *«木则兵»* (木则兵) states *«物所加也»* (\"*What is imposed by things*\"), which likely is not the original text. **Xí Zhòng** (奚侗) said: *«折»* (zhé) was mistakenly read as *«兵»* (bīng) due to damage, and then further confused as *«共»* (共) because of similar shapes. Now, we correct it based on the *Lièzǐ Huángdì Piān* (列子黄帝篇) and *Wénzǐ Dàoyuán Piān* (文子道原篇).\n\nHowever, in *Wénzǐ* (文子) and *Huáinán* (淮南), below *«rigid trees are felled»* (木强则折), there are additional rhyming phrases: *«strong leather cracks, firm teeth on the tongue wear out first»* (革强则裂，齿坚于舌而先敝). These may have been part of the original *Lǎozǐ* (老子) text but are now omitted. Thus, the strong and rigid are placed below, while the soft and frail are placed above.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) noted: Other editions render *«strong and rigid are placed below»* (强大处下) without *«thus»* (故). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) remarked: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition reads *«thus the strong and rigid are below»* (故坚强居下), while the *Dūnhuáng Rén* (敦煌庚) edition reads *«thus the strong and rigid are placed below»* (故强大处下).\n\n**Yán Kějūn’s** (严可均) case notes: The *Suìzhōu* (遂州), **Péng** (彭), and **Fù** (傅) editions render *«处»* (chǔ) as *«居»* (jū). The *Gāo* (高) edition in *Hàn* (汉) renders both *«处»* (chǔ) as *«居»* (jū). **Yán** (严) renders *«柔»* (soft) as *«小»* (xiǎo, \"small\"). The phrase *«strong and rigid are placed below»* (坚强处下) is consistent in **Péng** (彭), **Fù** (傅), and **Zhào** (赵) editions.\n\nThis is likely an analogy using grass and trees to illustrate that the rigid roots and trunks are placed below, while the soft branches and leaves are above.\n\n**【Phonology & Rhyme】** This chapter, as read by **Jiāng Shì** (江氏), lacks rhyme. **Yáo Wéntián** (姚文田) and **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) concur.",

The **Yán** (严) and **Péng** (彭) editions also use *«diminish»* (损), with **Péng** (彭) including the *«deficient under»* (不足于) phrase. **Lǐ Dàochún** (李道纯) states: *«Who can serve all under Heaven with excess»* (孰能以有余奉天下), adding *«deficient»* (不足) is incorrect.\n\n**Yán** (严) **Kějūn** (可均) notes: *«Acts without claiming credit»* (为而不恃), the *Suìzhōu* (遂州) edition lacks the *«and»* (而) character. *«When virtue/power is achieved, does not claim it»* (功成不处), the *Héshàng* (河上) and **Wáng** (王) editions have *«when»* (而) under *«achieved»* (成). *«This is why the sage is not seen»* (斯不见贤), all editions render *«This is why he does not wish to be seen»* (其不欲见贤), with **Gāo Qì** (高亨) adding *«is it not so?»* (邪) at the sentence's end.\n\n**Luò Zhènyù** (罗振玉) states: *«When virtue/power is achieved and does not claim it»* (功成而不处), the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions render *«achieved»* (成) as *«success»* (成功). *«This is why he does not wish to be seen»* (斯不见贤), the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) edition adds *«also»* (也) under *«sage»* (贤), while the *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition renders *«This is why he wishes to retire the sage»* (则其欲退贤). **Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) states: The *Dūnhuáng* (敦煌) edition renders *«seen»* (见) as *«show»* (示).\n\n**Yán** (严) **Qiānzhī** (谦之) case notes: The *Héshàng* (河上) annotation reads: *«He does not wish to show others his own virtue/power.»* Thus, *«seen»* (见) in the *Héshàng* (河上) edition is also rendered as *«show»* (示), as in **Gù Huān** (顾欢)'s version.

      "translated_text": "「Moreover, the sentence *«while attacking the hard»* (而攻坚) aligns in meaning with the forty-second chapter’s *«The utmost gentleness under Heaven overcomes the utmost hardness»* (天下之至柔，驰骋天下之至坚). The characters *«hard»* (坚) and *«overcomes»* (先) harmonize. Water can embrace mountains and level hills, grind iron and melt copper—thus it is said to *«attack the hard»* (攻坚). The old interpretation linking *«hard»* (坚) and *«strong»* (强) as a single term leaves no rhyme. Additionally, various editions append the character *«者»* after *«strong»* (强).\n\nThe character *«overcomes»* (先) is uniformly rendered as such in the editions of **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之), **Péng Yǔ** (彭裕), **Fù Yì** (傅奕), and **Fàn Zhì** (范注). There is no better alternative to it. **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) edition reads *«无易之»* (no alternative to it), while the *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition renders it as *«以其无能易之»* (for it has no ability to alter it). **Jiāo Qióng** (焦竑) states: *«以其无以易之也»* (for there is nothing with which to replace it), omitting one *«以»* (also).\n\n**Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The **Yán** (严) edition appends the character *«矣»* (particle of completion), while the **Fù** (傅) and **Fàn** (范) editions append *«也»* (particle of emphasis). Thus, the weak *«overcome»* (胜) the strong, the soft *«overcome»* (胜) the hard, and none under Heaven can know or practice it.\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: The *Guānzhù* (御注) and **Gāo Yì** (高翿) editions read *«故柔胜刚，弱胜强»* (Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong), while **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) omit the *«故»* (thus). **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Jǐngfú* (景福) edition renders *«柔之胜刚»* (the soft overcomes the hard) with *«胜»* (overcomes) as *«能»* (can), while the *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) and *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) editions omit *«故»* (thus) and follow the same pattern. The *Guānzhù* (御注) and *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) editions read *«故柔胜刚，弱胜强»* (Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong). The character *«不»* (not) is uniformly rendered as *«能»* (can).\n\n**Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The *Huáinán Dàoyìng Xuàn* (淮南道应训) cites **Lǎozǐ** (老子) as saying: *«柔之胜刚也，弱之胜强也，天下莫不知，而莫之能行»* (The soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong; none under Heaven fail to know it, yet none can practice it). This matches the **Fù** (傅) edition, except the **Fù** (傅) edition lacks the two *«也»* (particles of emphasis).\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: The *Guānzhù* (御注) edition reads *«是以圣人言»* (Therefore, the Sage says), while **Wáng Bì** (王弼) renders it as *«是以圣人云»*. **Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The *Dūnhuáng Xīn* (敦煌辛) edition omits *«云»* (says), while the *Guānzhù* (御注) edition uses *«言»* (says) instead. The *Jǐnglóng* (景龙) edition reads *«故圣人云»* (Therefore, the Sage says), and the *Jǐngfú* (景福) and *Dūnhuáng Gēng* (敦煌庚) editions render it as *«故圣人言云»*. **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: The **Nài** (柰) edition and **Héshàng** (河上) edition use *«云»* (says), while **Xíng Xuán** (邢玄), **Qìngyáng** (庆阳), **Pánxī** (磻溪), **Lóuzhèng** (楼正), **Gāo** (高), **Gǔ** (顾), **Péng** (彭), **Fàn** (范), and **Zhào** (赵) editions all use *«言»* (says). The **Fù** (傅) edition appends *«之言»* (of the Sage) after *«人»* (Sage). The correct rendering is *«言»* (says). The characters *«言»* (says) and *«云»* (says) share overlapping meanings, and *«云»* (says) is a redundant addition.\n\n*«To bear a state’s filth is called the master of the soil and grain; to bear a state’s misfortunes is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.»*\n\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: *«受国不祥»* (to bear a state’s misfortunes), the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Gāo Yì** (高翿) editions append *«之»* (of) after *«国»* (state). **Sūn Kuàng** (孙矿) in his *Kǎozhèng* (考正) notes: *«受国不祥»* (to bear a state’s misfortunes), modern editions often append *«之»* (of) after *«受国»* (to bear a state). **Liú Shīpèi** (刘师培) states: Referring to the *Huáinán Dàoyìng Xuàn* (淮南道应训) citation of **Lǎozǐ** (老子), *«受国»* (to bear a state) is preceded by *«能»* (can) in all editions, and *«不祥»* (misfortunes) is also preceded by *«之»* (of)—this should be the ancient original. **Yán Qiānzhī** (严谦之) case notes: *«垢»* (filth) carries the meaning of defilement and shame. According to the *Zhuāngzǐ Tiānxià Piān* (庄子天下篇) citation of **Lǎodān** (老聃): *«知其雄，守其雌，为天下溪；知其白，守其辱，为天下谷。人皆取先，己独取后，曰受天下之垢。」* **Guō Xiàng** (郭象) annotates: *«雌、辱、后、下之类»* (feminine, humiliation, later, lower—these are all what is termed as *«垢»* (filth) in things). In the *Zuǎnzhùán* (宣十五年左传), **Bó Zōng** (伯宗) says: *«川泽纳污，山薮藏疾，瑾瑜匿瑕，国君含垢，天之道也»* (Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor diseases, fine jade hides its flaws, and rulers bear the shame of their states—this is the Dao of Heaven). **Dù** (杜) annotates: *«忍垢耻»* (enduring filth and shame). Indeed, stepping back and placing oneself last, yielding to others first, and enduring what people abhor—this is nearly the Dao, the original meaning of *«垢»* (filth).\n\nThe character *«王»* (sovereign) is defined in the *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字): *«The place where all under Heaven turn toward»* (天下所归往也). The *Gǔliáng Zhuāngsān Zhuàn* (谷梁庄三传) states: *«Its saying ‘sovereign’ (王者), is the place where the people turn toward»* (其曰王者，民之所归往也). *«王»* (sovereign) is explained as *«往»* (toward), the place where people converge—this is the original meaning of *«王»* (sovereign).

This chapter does the same.\n\nMoreover, the characters *«反»* (contrary), *«怨»* (grudge), and *«善»* (good) rhyme together, thus confirming that this sentence should serve as the **opening statement** (起语).\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) concurs: **Wú Chéng’s** (吴澄) interpretation is correct. *«Correct speech seems contrary»* (正言若反) appears in the **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙碑本) and **Yán’s edition** (严本) without chapter division, further validating this.\n\n**[Rhymes and Tones]** In this chapter, **Jiāng’s pronunciation** (江氏韵读) reads:\n- *«强»* (strong), *«刚»* (rigid), *«行»* (overcome) in the **Yáng rhyme category** (阳部)\n- *«垢»* (filth), *«主»* (sovereign) in the **Hóu rhyme category** (侯部, where *«主»* is pronounced as *«朱掫反»* [Zhǔ, rhyming with *chǔ*])\n- *«祥»* (auspicious), *«王»* (sovereign) in the **Yáng rhyme category** (阳部)\n- *«言»* (speaking), *«反»* (contrary) in the **Yuán rhyme category** (元部, where *«反»* is pronounced with a **level tone** [平声])\n\n**Yáo Wéndiàn** (姚文田) and **Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) agree, though they overlooked *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary).\n**Gāohàn Yǐng** (高本汉) notes: *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary) rhyme.\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) mistakenly claims: *«祥»* (auspicious), *«王»* (sovereign), *«反»* (contrary) rhyme.\n\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) clarifies: *«言»* (speaking) and *«反»* (contrary) belong to the next chapter. The rhyme of *«反»* (contrary), *«怨»* (grudge), and *«善»* (good) aligns with the **Jiāngjìn Third Decade rhyme** (江晋三廿一部谐声表入元部声), while **Yáo Wéndiàn** (姚文田) follows the **ancient pronunciation** (古音), harmonizing them under the **ninth *Hán* rhyme** (九寒去声). Thus, the three characters rhyme together.\n\nAdditionally, *«而攻坚»* (and assail the rigid) is a complete sentence, with *«坚»* (rigid) rhyming with *«先»* (first). This is as previously explained.\n\n**Gù Yànwú** (顾炎武) in his *Tángyùn Zhèngjuǎn* (唐韵正卷) under the **shòu rhyme** (厚) states: *«垢»* (filth) is pronounced **gū** (古) in ancient times.\nThe **Laozi** (老子) says: *«To endure a nation’s filth, one becomes its sovereign of soil and grain»* (受国之垢，是为社稷主).\n**Dèng Tíngzhēn** (邓廷桢) states: *«主»* (sovereign) in ancient pronunciation belongs to the **Hóu rhyme category** (侯部). In the *Yì* (易) *Fēng* (丰) hexagram, *«六二»* (sixth line, second) and *«九四»* (ninth line, fourth) rhyme with *«蔀»* (bamboo blind) and *«斗»* (dipper), while in the *Shījìng* (诗经) *Xíng* (行) ode, *«苇»* (reed) rhymes with *«醹»* (fermented rice wine), *«斗»* (dipper), and *«厚»* (thick). This confirms its ancient pronunciation.\n\nIn **Laozi’s** (老子) *«To endure a nation’s filth, one becomes its sovereign of soil and grain»* (受国之垢，是谓社稷主), *«垢»* (filth) and *«主»* (sovereign) rhyme.\n\nThe **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙碑本) does not divide chapters, containing **62 characters**. The **Héshàng edition** (河上本) has **65 characters**, **Wáng’s edition** (王本) **64 characters**, **Fù’s edition** (傅本) **73 characters**, and **Fàn’s edition** (范本) **71 characters**. The **Héshàng edition** (河上本) titles it *«The Chapter of Tasking Speech»* (任言第七十八), **Wáng’s edition** (王本) titles it *«The Seventy-Eighth Chapter»* (七十八章), and **Fàn’s edition** (范本) titles it *«The Chapter Where No One Under Heaven is Yielding and Weak Like Water»* (一天下莫柔弱于水章第七十八).\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine** (七十九章):\n*«Harmonizing with great grudges, one must inevitably have excess grudges—how can this be considered good?»* (和大怨，必有余怨，安可以为善？)\n**Qiánzhì** (谦之) notes: The **Guāngmíng edition** (广明本) reads *«知»* (know) instead of *«和»* (harmonize), and **Péng’s edition** (彭本) has *«者»* (one) after *«怨»* (grudge).\n\n**Yè Mèngdé’s edition** (叶梦得本) omits the *«必»* (inevitably) character.\nThe **Wénzǐ** (文子) in the *Wēimíng* (微明) passage cites the first two sentences identically, with the third sentence reading *«奈何其为不善也»* (how can it be considered not good?), maintaining the same meaning.\n\nThus, the sage holds onto the **left tablet** (左契) and does not demand accountability from others.\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: *«Does not demand accountability from others»* (不责于人) is annotated in the **Yùzhù** (御注) as *«while not demanding accountability from the people»* (而不责于民). The **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) editions include the *«而»* (while) character.\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙本) and the **Dūnhuáng Xīn edition** (敦煌辛本) lack the *«而»* (while) character.\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) adds: The **Suìzhōu edition** (遂州本) and **Yán’s edition** (严本) also lack *«而»*, but **Yán’s edition** (严本) includes *«以»* (by/with) instead.\n**Mǎ Xùlún** (马叙伦) states: *«契»* (tablet) should be read as *«契»* (same character).\n\nThe *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) defines it: *«Carving on wood»* (刻木也).\nToday, *«契»* (tablet) is commonly used in this sense.\n**Zhū Qióushēng** (朱骏声) says: The *Shuōwén Jiězì* (说文解字) also defines *«契»* (tablet) as *«an agreement»* (大约也).\nNowadays, *«契»* (tablet) refers to mutual agreements.\n\nThe *Yì Shìyì* (易系辞) states: *«Later sages replaced this with written tablets»* (后世圣人易之以书契).\n**Zhèng’s annotation** (郑注) explains: *«They wrote words on the edges of wooden tablets to record matters, and carving on wood was called ‘book tablet’ (书契).»*\nThe *Zhōulǐ* (周礼) *Zhìrén* (质人) passage says: *«He is in charge of the written tablets for market transactions»* (掌稽市之书契).\nThe annotation clarifies: *«The tablets are used as receipts for buying and selling. Their design resembles two wooden strips, with inscriptions on their sides.»*\nThe *Lǐjì* (礼记) *Qūlǐ* (曲礼) passage states: *«Those presenting millet hold the right tablet»* (献粟者执右契).\nThe **commentary** (疏) explains: *«Two tablets are written on one side, identical but distinguished.»*\nAdditionally, the **Hán’s annotation** (韩注) on *«operating the right tablet»* (操右契) states: *«The left tablet is kept for verification, while the right tablet is used for demanding or taking payment.»*\n**Zhāng Bǐnglín** (章炳麟) notes: *«Life and death agreements»* (死生契阔) is also written as *«挈»* (same character).\nThe **Hán’s annotation on the Shījìng** (韩诗说) states: *«契阔 (or 挈阔) means ‘binding agreement’ (约束也).»*\nThus, *«契»* (tablet) refers to temporary agreements made according to circumstances.\n\n**Laozi** (老子) says: *«The sage holds onto the left tablet and does not demand accountability from others»* (圣人执左契，而不责于人). (小答问)\n\nTherefore, those with **virtue/power** (有德) oversee the tablets, while those without oversee the **penetrating/withdrawing** (彻).\n**Yán Kějūn** (严可均) states: *«Therefore»* (故) is omitted in the **Héshàng** (河上) and **Wáng Bì** (王弼) editions.\n**Luó Zhènyù** (罗振玉) notes: The **Jìnglóng Stele edition** (景龙本), **Yùzhù** (御注), and **Dūnhuáng Xīn edition** (敦煌辛本) all include *«故»* (therefore) at the beginning of the sentence.\n**Wǔnèi Yìxióng** (武内义雄) adds: The **Dūn** (敦), **Suì** (遂), and **Jìng** (景) editions all include *«故»* (therefore) at the start of the sentence.\n*«彻»* (penetrating) is written as *«撤»* (withdraw) in the **Dūn edition** (敦本), *«辙»* (tracks) in the **Suì edition** (遂本).\n**Qiánzhī** (谦之) notes: The **Yán’s edition** (严本) also reads *«辙»* (tracks).\nThough *«彻»* (penetrating) and *«辙»* (tracks) were interchangeably used in ancient times, *«彻»* (penetrating) is more appropriate here.\n**Yú Yì** (俞樾) states: *«As for ancient characters, 『彻』 (chè) and 『辙』 (zhé) were used interchangeably.

Additionally, *Fù* and *Fàn*, along with *Péng*, write *\"居\"* (*jū*, \"dwellings\") as *\"俗\"* (*sú*, \"customs\"), *\"俗\"* (*sú*) as *\"业\"* (*yè*, \"livelihood\"), and insert *\"使\"* (*shǐ*, \"to make\") before *\"民\"* (*mín*). The *Yán* version places *\"安其居\"* (*ān qí jū*) after *\"乐其俗\"* (*lè qí sú*). The *Heshang Gong* and *Gù* versions omit *\"death\"* (*sǐ*), while *Fù* and *Péng* add *\"与\"* (*yǔ*, \"with\") after *\"相\"* (*xiāng*). The *Zhìyào* citation renders *\"美其服\"* (*měi qí fú*) as *\"美其衣\"* (*měi qí yī*).\n\n**Qiānzhī** commentary: The character *\"邻\"* (*lín*), in the *Guāngmíng*, *Luó Juǎn*, and *Gù* versions, is consistent. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* notes: *\"Five families form a neighborhood, from *邑* (*yì*), phonetic.\"* Anciently written as *○*. The *Jiǔ Jīng Zìyàng* states: *\"The versions writing '邻' (*lín*) are erroneous; it should be written as '邻' (*lín*).\"*\n\n**Qiānzhī** commentary: The *Zhuangzi* in *\"Tú Gē\"* (*Túgē*, \"Opening the Coffers\") discusses *\"至德之世\"* (*zhìdé zhī shì*, \"the age of utmost virtue\"), and in *\"Mǎtí\"* (*Mǎtí*, \"Horses’ Hooves\") states *\"民有常性，织而衣，耕而食\"* (*mín yǒu chángxìng, zhī ér yī, gēng ér shí*, \"the people have inherent nature, they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves\"), both passages drawing from this chapter. The nine sentences cited in *\"Tú Gē\"* differ only in that *\"安其居，乐其俗\"* (*ān qí jū, lè qí sú*, \"secure their dwellings, joy in their customs\") are inverted.\n\nFurther, the *Huáinán Zǐ* in *\"Qí Sú\"* (*Qísú*, \"On the Customs of Equality\") states: *\"Thus neighboring states are visible to one another, the sounds of roosters and dogs are heard, yet their footprints do not cross the borders of the lords, and their wheel tracks do not join at a thousand *lǐ* (miles) away—all find their proper place.\"* The *Lùnliáng* in *\"Shuō Rì\"* (*Shuōrì*, \"Discussing the Sun\") states: *\"In ancient times, simplicity prevailed, neighboring states bordered each other, the sounds of roosters and dogs were heard, yet they did not visit one another throughout their lives.\"* Both passages derive from this chapter of *Laozi*. The *Shǐjì* in *\"Huòshī\"* (*Huòshī*, \"On the Monopolies of Commerce\") also contains *\"至治之极\"* (*zhìdào zhī jí*, \"at the utmost limit of good governance\"). Though the stele versions lack this sentence, it may be supplemented based on the *Fù* and *Fàn* versions and the citations in *Zhuangzi* and *Shǐjì*.\n\n---\n**【Rhymes】** This chapter, as per *Jiāng Shì*’s rhyming readings, lacks rhyme. *Yáo Wéntián* and *Dèng Tíngzhēn* agree. *Gāo Běn Hàn* renders it as *\"至治之极，民各甘其食，美其服，安其俗，乐其业\"* (*zhìdào zhī jí, mín gè gān qí shí, měi qí fú, ān qí sú, lè qí yè*), with *\"极\"* (*jí*), *\"食\"* (*shí*), *\"服\"* (*fú*), *\"俗\"* (*sú*), and *\"业\"* (*yè*) rhyming—though *\"俗\"* (*sú*) does not actually rhyme. Further, *\"邻国相望\"* (*lín guó xiāng wàng*) to *\"老死不相往来\"* (*lǎo sǐ bù xiāng wànglái*)—*Gāo Běn Hàn* incorrectly changes *\"往来\"* (*wànglái*) to *\"来往\"* (*láiwàng*), to harmonize with *\"望\"* (*wàng*), which is a grave error.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\n*\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise do not amass knowledge; those who amass knowledge are not wise.\"*\n\n**Luó Zhènyù** commentary: The *Dunhuang Xīn* version renders *\"知\"* (*zhī*) as *\"智\"* (*zhì*).\n\n**Takeshi Uchida** commentary: The *\"The virtuous do not argue\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn*) and *\"those who argue are not virtuous\"* (*biànzhě bù shàn*) passages appear after *\"The wise do not amass knowledge\"* (*zhìzhě bù bó*) and *\"those who amass knowledge are not wise\"* (*bózhě bù zhì*) in the *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* versions. **Qiānzhī** commentary: The *Yán* and *Gù* versions align with the *Dunhuang* and *Suizhou* versions.\n\nThe *Fù* and *Fàn* versions render *\"善者不辩\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn*) and *\"辩者不善\"* (*biànzhě bù shàn*) as *\"善言不辩\"* (*shàn yán bù biàn*) and *\"辩言不善\"* (*biàn yán bù shàn*), respectively.\n\n**Yú Zǎo** commentary: This should be read as *\"信者不美，美者不信\"* (*xìnzhě bù měi, měizhě bù xìn*, \"true words are not beautiful, beautiful words are not true\"), matching the parallel structure of the following *\"善者不辩，辩者不善；知者不博，博者不知\"* (*shànzhě bù biàn, biànzhě bù shàn; zhìzhě bù bó, bózhě bù zhì*).\n\n*Heshang Gong*’s commentary on *\"信者不美\"* (*xìnzhě bù měi*) states: *\"True words, as they are in reality.

      "translated_text": "「」This confirms that the ancient text should indeed read *\"xìnzhě bù měi\"* (信者不美), without the *\"yán\"* (言) character.\n\n**Táo Hóngqìng** remarked: *\"According to Yú Shì’s reliance on Heshang Gong’s annotation, the original text’s two instances of '言' should both be '者', aligning with the parallel structure below. Now, referring to Wáng Bì’s annotation, which states: 'Real and unadorned, rooted in simplicity,' he elucidates the meanings of '信' and '美' without addressing '言', implying his source text also used '者'.*\n\n**Qiānzhī** counters: *\"Yú and Táo’s argument is incorrect. In *Wénxīn Diāolóng*’s *Qíngcǎi* chapter, it states: 'Lǎozǐ detests falsity, thus declaring 『méi yán bù xìn』 (美言不信).' This proves Liú Xiè’s *Lǎozǐ* text included the '言' character. Heshang Gong’s annotation here reads: 'Excessively ornate speech, laboring over flowery words—untrue, embellished with deceit and emptiness.' Moreover, in *Chéng Xuànyīng’s* *Kāití Jùyì Yìshū*, this chapter is titled the 'Shìyán' (信言) chapter. The *shū* states: 'Shì (信) means reality; měi (美) means superficial brilliance. The speech of the virtuous—real yet unadorned... Superficial brilliance in speech... contradicts ultimate truth, hence untrue. Thus Zhuangzi says, 『Dogs are not good barkers for being virtuous; people are not virtuous for speaking well.』' This confirms Heshang Gong’s text and the stele edition are identical. Wáng Bì’s annotation on Chapter 62, *\"méi yán kěyǐ shì\"* (美言可以市), states: 'Ornate speech can deceive merchants, hence \"ornate speech can trade.\"' In this chapter, his annotation reads: 'Real and unadorned, rooted in simplicity.' The meaning is consistent. Though he does not mention '言', its implication is inherent—how can one assert his source text *must* have used '者'?\n\nAs for the *\"shànzhě bù biàn\"* (善者不辩) passage, **Jiāo Jùn** in *Kǎoyì* notes: 'The ancient text reads *\"shàn yán bù biàn, biàn yán bù shàn\"* (善言不辩，辩言不善).' Similarly, in *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Qíwùlùn*, it states *\"dà biàn bù yán\"* (大辩不言), echoing the same sentiment. The *\"bù zhī shēn yǐ, zhī zhī qiǎn yǐ\"* (不知深矣，知之浅矣) in *Běiyóu Piān* also parallels the *\"zhìzhě bù bó\"* (知者不博) passage in meaning.\n\n*'Shèngrén bù jī'* (圣人不积): *Yán Kějūn* notes that the *Yùzhù* renders this as *\"wú jī\"* (无积), while **Luó Zhènyù** observes that the *Yùzhù*, *Jǐngfú*, and other versions use *\"yǔ\"* (与) instead of *\"wéi\"* (为). **Qiānzhī** confirms that *Xíng Xuán*, *Qìngyáng*, *Pánxī*, and *Lóuzhèng* all use *\"yǔ\"* (与). The two *\"yù\"* (愈) characters are rendered as *\"yú\"* (逾) by *Xíng Xuán*, while *Fàn* uses *\"yú\"* (俞)—an ancient character mistakenly written as *\"yú\"* (逾). The stele edition’s Chapter 5 also uses *\"yú\"* (俞). Additionally, *\"shèngrén bù jī\"* (圣人不积) is rendered as *\"wú jī\"* (无积) in *Yán*, *Péng*, *Fù*, *Zhào*, and *Gāo* versions, while *Heshang Gong* and *Wáng Bì* use *\"bù jī\"* (不积). The correct form is *\"wú jī\"* (无积). The *Zhàn guó cè*’s *Wèi cè* quotes Lǎozǐ as saying: *\"Shèngrén wú jī, jìn wéi rén jǐ yù yǒu, jì yǐ yǔ rén jǐ yù duō\"* (圣人无积，尽以为人己愈有，既以与人己愈多), where *\"bù jī\"* (不积) is also rendered as *\"wú jī\"* (无积). The *\"jì yǐ yǔ rén\"* (既以与人) sentence is identical to *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Tiánzǐfāng Piān*. The *\"jìn wéi rén\"* (尽以为人) sentence’s *\"jìn\"* (尽) can be emended to *\"jì\"* (既) based on *Wèicè*, forming a parallel structure.\n\nMoreover, *\"jī\"* (积) carries the meaning of 'to hoard.' In *Chǔyǔ*, *\"wú yīrì zhī jī\"* (无一日之积) is annotated as *\"jī\"* (积) meaning 'to store.' In *Zhuāngzǐ’s* *Tiāndào*, *\"yùn ér wú suǒ jī\"* (运而无所积) is annotated in the *Shìwén*: 'Referring to stagnation and blockage.' In *Tiānxià Piān*, it states of Lǎodān: *\"yǐ yǒu jī wéi bùzú... wú cáng yě gù yǒuyú\"* (以有积为不足... 无藏也故有余), meaning 'not hoarding thus having abundance.'

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, Kong Guangsen composed *Poetic Sound Categories*, stating:\n\n*\"Nowadays, poetry prioritizes literary elegance, whereas ancient poetry prioritized song. Song has rhythms of haste and slowness, harmonies of clarity and turbidity—sometimes unfolding in lengthy recitation, sighing and chanting across multiple lines without strict rhyme; sometimes binding sound to tight rhythms, where each sentence rhymes, each character rhymes, yet never tiring of it.\"*\n\nI hold that the *Five Thousand Words* of *Dao/Way and Virtue/Power* is ancient philosophical poetry. Since it is poetry, it must be singable, recitable—its rhythms of haste and slowness, its harmonies of clarity and turbidity, though not necessarily identical to the *Three Hundred Poems*, yet whether or not it rhymes, it surely adheres to poetic conventions without doubt.\n\nHowever, in the Song dynasty’s *Wu Qi’s Rhyme Supplement*, it was already lamented that *\"Laozi’s Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic, composed by Old Master Laozi beneath the Zhou dynasty’s ancestral hall, contains many rhymed passages, yet today they are often mispronounced.\"* Thus, establishing principles and examples—how can they be neglected? I now compose *Laozi’s Rhyme Patterns*.\n\n**(1)** Times change, sounds diverge—each era has its own phonetic system. Ancient rhymes cannot align with Tang, nor Tang rhymes with today. As Yan Bai’s poem states, *\"The sounds of past and present are bound to their times\"*—how true this is! Reading the *Five Thousand Words* with modern pronunciation feels discordant, yet applying ancient pronunciation reveals many alignments, with discrepancies often arising from scribal errors. In the past, Deng Tingzhen examined the rhymes in the *Five Thousand Words*, aligning them with the *Book of Changes* and *Book of Poetry*. For instance, in the chapter *\"Discerning Virtue/Power\"*, *fù (富)*, *zhì (志)*, and *jiǔ (久)* form a single rhyme—*jiǔ* rhyming with *fù* and *zhì* matches the *Book of Poetry*, while the following sentence rhymes with *shòu (寿)*, aligning with the *Book of Changes*. In truth, the *Five Thousand Words* sometimes aligns with the *Book of Poetry*, sometimes diverges, yet with the *Book of Changes*, it is nearly identical. Moreover, since Chu people wrote in Chu dialect with Chu pronunciation, this also marks the beginning of *Sao* rhyme. Let me cite examples where it aligns with the *Book of Changes*:\n\n**(1)** Chapter 5: *\"Excessive speech leads to exhaustion; better to guard the center.\"* *Qióng (穷)* and *zhōng (中)* rhyme.\n   - *Book of Changes*’ *Need* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)* rhyme.\n   - *Obstruction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *gōng (功)*, *bāng (邦)* rhyme.\n   - *Misfortune* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Well* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)*, *xiōng (凶)* rhyme.\n   - *Progress* commentary: *gōng (功)*, *bāng (邦)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Dispersion* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *tóng (同)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)* rhyme.\n   - *Restriction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Completion* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Earth* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (终)* rhyme.\n   - *Following* commentary: *xiōng (凶)*, *gōng (功)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Great Strength* commentary: *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)* rhyme.\n   - *Restriction* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)* rhyme.\n   - *Wind* commentary: *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *zhōng (中)*, *gōng (功)*, *zhōng (中)*, *qióng (穷)*, *xiōng (凶)* rhyme.\n\n**(2)** Chapter 24: *\"The ambitious falter soon;

Knowing the **Dao/Way of Sound** (声音之道), it shifts with the times yet aligns with *Book of Changes* and *Chu Ci*, and upon examination, all are not far from **Laozi** (老子). The *Five Thousand Words* (五千言) is indeed one of the two great **philosophical poems** (哲学诗) of ancient China alongside *Book of Changes* (易经); **Laozi** being a native of Chu (楚人), it also harmonizes with the **Chu melodies** (楚声). Though **Laozi** is traditionally placed after **Qu Yuan** (屈) in historical order, the frequency of the particle **\"xiē\"** (兮) in the text suggests a close affinity with *Chu Ci*’s rhymes—could the *Five Thousand Words* be the **progenitor of Chu melodies** (楚声之元祖)?\n\n**(Part II)** Research on **Laozi**’s ancient rhymes began with **Song dynasty Wu Ji** (宋吴棫). Following **Metaphorical Firewood** (顾炎武) and **Jiang Shenxiu** (江慎修) in the **Qing dynasty**, the most notable works are **Jiang Jinsan**’s (江晋三) *Laozi* rhyme readings, **Yao Wentian**’s (姚文田) *Harmony of Ancient Sounds*, and **Deng Tingzhen**’s (邓廷桢) *Notes from the Double Inkstone Studio* (双砚斋笔记). **Deng**’s work uniquely clarifies the boundaries between the **Yu** (虞) and **Hou** (侯) tonal categories, and the classification of **entering tones** (入声) under various departments, yet it does not delve into a comprehensive study of ancient rhymes.\n\n**Jiang Jinsan** (江晋三) presents a **twenty-department harmony** (廿一部谐声), while **Yao Wentian** (姚文田) organizes **twenty-eight ancient rhyme departments** (古韵廿八部), meticulously cross-referencing each line and word in the *Five Thousand Words* (五千言) to elucidate rhyme principles. Though some omissions exist, their deviations are few. Particularly, **Jiang Jinsan**’s rhyme readings align with **Wang Renxun**’s (王念孙) *Ancient Rhyme Chart* (古韵谱), providing scholars with valuable resources. The following is an attempt to compare and arrange them (with the numbers in the table corresponding to **Laozi**’s chapter sequence):",

      "translated_text": "**(Section III)** A meticulous examination of Jiang Shi’s *Laozi* rhyme readings reveals his most significant divergence from Yao Wenti’s approach: Jiang takes the *Five Thousand Words* as a rhymed text and elucidates the principles of **through-rhymes (通韵)** and **combined rhymes (合韵)**. For instance, in Chapter 41, where *gǔ* (谷), *rǔ* (辱), *zú* (足), *tōu* (偷), *yú* (渝), and *yú* (隅) all belong to the *Hóu* (侯) rhyme category, Yao Wenti and Deng Tingzhen split them into two—*gǔ, rǔ, zú* in one (sixth *Wū* entering-tone), and *tōu, yú* in another (thirteenth *Hóu* level-tone). Jiang, however, rejects this erroneous entering-tone division, treating all six as a single rhyme.\n\nThis is but one example of harmonizing within the same rhyme class; yet when it comes to **cross-rhyme transformations (通转)** between different classes, only those with exquisite phonetic discernment dare speak of it. For example, in Chapter 67, *yǒng* (勇), *guǎng* (广), and *zhǎng* (长) form a **Yang-Dong through-rhyme**, yet Yao Wenti and Deng Tingzhen only acknowledge *guǎng* and *zhǎng*. In Chapter 2, *shì* (事), *jiào* (教), *cí* (辞), *yǒu* (有), and *shì* (恃) belong to the **Zhī-Xiāo combined rhyme**, but Yao and Deng only recognize *cí, yǒu, shì*. Even more complex are cases like Chapter 64, where *sǎn* (散), *luàn* (乱), and *mò* (末) form a **Zhì-Yuán through-rhyme**, or Chapter 35, where *wèi* (味), *jiàn* (见), and *jì* (既) form a **Zhī-Yuán combined rhyme**—these require mastery of **yin-yang opposing transformations (阴阳对转)** to comprehend.\n\nWhen examining *Laozi*’s through-rhymes and combined rhymes, Jiang’s discoveries reveal the following patterns:\n\n**Through-Rhymes (通韵):**\n1. **Zhī-Yōu** (之、幽) (Chapters 9, 16, 25, 52, 33, 50, 59)\n2. **Yōu-Xiāo** (幽、宵) (Chapter 41)\n3. **Hóu-Yú** (侯、鱼) (Chapters 26, 30, 34)\n4. **Gē-Zhī** (歌、支) (Chapters 10, 28)\n5. **Zhī-Zhì** (脂、祭) (Chapter 45)\n6. **Zhì-Yuán** (祭、元) (Chapter 64)\n7. **Yuán-Zhēn** (元、真) (Chapter 30)\n8. **Wén-Zhēn** (文、真) (Chapters 1, 15, 26)\n9. **Zhēn-Gēng** (真、耕) (Chapters 22, 32)\n10. **Yáng-Dōng** (阳、东) (Chapters 12, 16, 22, 25, 26, 67)\n\n**Combined Rhymes (合韵):**\n1. **Zhī-Xiāo** (之、宵) (Chapter 2)\n2. **Yōu-Hóu** (幽、侯) (Chapter 17)\n3. **Zhī-Yuán** (脂、元) (Chapter 35)\n\nAmong these, **\"Zhī-Yōu,\" \"Hóu-Yú,\" \"Zhī-Zhì,\" \"Zhēn-Gēng,\" and \"Wén-Zhēn\"** are instances of **adjacent-class transformations (近旁通转)**. Specifically:\n- **\"Zhī-Yōu,\" \"Hóu-Yú,\" \"Zhī-Zhì\"** are **yin-tone adjacent transformations (阴声近旁转)**.\n- **\"Zhēn-Gēng,\" \"Wén-Zhēn,\" \"Yáng-Dōng\"** are **yang-tone adjacent transformations (阳声近旁转)**.\n- **\"Zhī-Xiāo,\" \"Yōu-Hóu\"** are **yin-tone adjacent combined rhymes (阴声近旁合)**.\n\nNext, **\"Yuán-Zhēn\" and \"Yōu-Xiāo\"** are **secondary adjacent transformations (次旁通转)**—**\"Yuán-Zhēn\"** being **yang-tone secondary (阳声次旁转)**, and **\"Yōu-Xiāo\"** being **yin-tone secondary (阴声次旁转)**.\n**\"Gē-Zhī\"** is a **further secondary yin-tone transformation (阴声又次旁转)**, while **\"Zhì-Yuán\"** is a **yin-yang opposing secondary through-rhyme (阴阳相对之次通转)**, and **\"Zhī-Yuán\"** is a **yin-yang opposing secondary combined rhyme (阴阳相对之又次对合)**.\n\nIf we were to illustrate these patterns following Kong Guangsen’s and Zhang Binglin’s theories, a diagram as described above would clarify them.\n\n**(Section IV)** The *Five Thousand Words* of *Laozi* exhibits varied pacing, length, and rhyme structures: some passages employ rhyme throughout; others rhyme only at the chapter’s beginning, while the middle or end remains unrestricted; still others insert interjections or rhetorical phrases that do not conform to rhyme schemes. This reflects what may be called **\"free-rhyming\"**—a hallmark of **philosophical poetry**.\n\nIn terms of rhyme structure, some verses mirror the *Shijing*’s strictness. For example, Chapter 28:\n*\"Know its masculine, hold to its feminine—*\n*Thus you become the valley of the world.*\n*Be the valley of the world,*\n*Constant virtue never departs,*\n*And returns to the infant state.\"* **(Gē-Zhī through-rhyme)**\n\n*\"Know its bright, hold to its dark—*\n*Thus you become the model of the world.*\n*Be the model of the world,*\n*Constant virtue never errs,*\n*And returns to the boundless.\"* **(Zhī rhyme)**\n\n*\"Know its honor, hold to its disgrace—*\n*Thus you become the valley of the world.*\n*Be the valley of the world,*\n*Constant virtue attains sufficiency,*\n*And returns to the Primordial.\"* **(Hóu rhyme)**\n\nOr Chapter 10:\n*\"Nurture the vital essence, embrace the One—*\n*How could it ever stray?*\n*Concentrate the *qi*, attain softness—*\n*How could it ever be infantile?*\n*Purify the mystic vision—*\n*How could it ever be flawed?*\n*Love the people, govern the state—*\n*How could it ever act?*\n*The Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—*\n*How could it ever be feminine?*\n*Illuminated, four-way—*\n*How could it ever know?\"* **(Gē-Zhī through-rhyme)**\n\nHere, the **one-stanza-three-refrains (一唱三叹)** technique—where sound echoes sound—would not seem out of place in the *Three Hundred Poems*. Yet the distinction remains: while the *Shijing* sings of human emotions, *Laozi* competes in **rational exposition**. The defining feature of **philosophical poetry** lies in its **content**; differing substance demands differing form. Thus, while *Laozi*’s rhyme schemes share similarities with poetry, they also diverge—and unlike the *Yijing*, they bear no fundamental difference.",

For instance, in rhyming through repetition, the *Laozi* provides many examples, and there are corroborations found in poetry and the *Yijing*. In poetry, the *Jiangqi* (Ch. 195) follows the *Zong* (Zong rhyme) in each stanza; the *Geqi* (Ch. 202) follows the *Qing* (Qing rhyme) in the first two stanzas; the *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Dian* (Dian rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Shengmin* (Ch. 203) follows the *Lin* (Lin rhyme) in its three stanzas; the *Zai* (Ch. 204) follows the *Shen* (Shen rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Qian* (Ch. 205) follows the *Kuang* (Kuang rhyme) in its first two stanzas; the *Heren* (Ch. 197) follows the *Xing* (Xing rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Qiaoyan* (Ch. 206) follows the *Sheng* (Sheng rhyme) in its two stanzas; the *Hongyan* (Ch. 207), *Yi* (Ch. 196), and *Sangrou* (Ch. 208) all follow the *Ren* (Ren rhyme); the *Mian* (Ch. 198) follows the *Men* (Men rhyme) in its seven stanzas; the *Dang* (Ch. 209) follows the *Shang* (Shang rhyme) in its stanzas beginning from the second, using the character \"商\" (Shang); the *Dongshan* (Ch. 210) follows the *Shan* (Shan rhyme) in each stanza, using the character \"山\" (Shan); the *Yu* (Ch. 199) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Qiaoyan* (Ch. 206) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Binzhi* (Ch. 211) follows the *Yan* (Yan rhyme) in its first stanza; the *Cawei* (Ch. 212) follows the *He* (He rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Han* (Ch. 213) follows the *He* (He rhyme) in its three stanzas; the *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its ten stanzas; the *Chuche* (Ch. 214) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its five stanzas; the *Xiangbo* (Ch. 215) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its seven stanzas; the *Nanshan* (Ch. 216) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its first, second, fourth, and fifth stanzas.\n\nOther examples include *Lai* (Ch. 217) with *lai* (Lai rhyme), *Guo* (Ch. 218) with *guo* (Guo rhyme), *Shu* (Ch. 219) with *shu* (Shu rhyme), *Nü* (Ch. 220) with *nü* (Nü rhyme), *Di* (Ch. 221) with *di* (Di rhyme), *Zui* (Ch. 222) with *zui* (Zui rhyme), *You* (Ch. 223) with *you* (You rhyme), *Le* (Ch. 224) with *le* (Le rhyme)—repetitive rhymes that are countless in number.\n\nAgain, taking the *Yijing* as an example, the *Yi* (Ch. 225) follows the *Yang* (Yang rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Da* (Ch. 226) follows the *Zhang* (Zhang rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Guan* (Ch. 227) follows the *Sheng* (Sheng rhyme) in its sixth line, ninth line, and upper ninth line; the *Jie* (Ch. 228) follows the *Ting* (Ting rhyme) in its initial ninth line and second line; the *Ding* (Ch. 229) follows the *Yuan* (Yuan rhyme) in its sixth line and upper ninth line; the *Bi* (Ch. 230) follows the *Wen* (Wen rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Xun* (Ch. 231) follows the *Rui* (Rui rhyme) in its fifth line; the *Sun* (Ch. 232) follows the *Shi* (Shi rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Xiao* (Ch. 233) follows the *Shi* (Shi rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Lun* (Ch. 234) follows the *Zi* (Zi rhyme) in its sixth line; the *Yi* (Ch. 235) follows the *Hui* (Hui rhyme) in its sixth line and *Kun* (Ch. 236) follows the *Hui* (Hui rhyme) in its upper sixth line; the *Meng* (Ch. 237) follows the *Kou* (Kou rhyme) in its upper ninth line; the *Cui* (Ch. 238) follows the *Ju* (Ju rhyme) in its *Tuan* (Tuan rhyme) passage; the *Lü* (Ch. 239) follows the *Pu* (Pu rhyme) in its second and ninth lines; the *Dayu* (Ch. 240) follows the *Jiu* (Jiu rhyme) in its initial ninth line.\n\nThus, it is known that within the *Wuyingyan* (Five Thousand Words), rhymes like *Dao* (Dao rhyme), *Ming* (Ming rhyme), *Ren* (Ren rhyme), and even *Gou* (Gou rhyme) are hardly exceptional. Further, in the case of auxiliary rhymes, the *Yi* (Ch. 225) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Yu* (Yu rhyme) in its *Xiang* (Xiang rhyme) passage; the *Ding* (Ch. 229) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *You* (You rhyme) in its *Xiang* (Xiang rhyme) passage.\n\nEven if one claims the *Shijing* does not conform to auxiliary rhymes, this is not true. The *Yi* (Ch. 196) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its ten stanzas; the *Zai* (Ch. 204) follows the *You* (You rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its four stanzas; the *Xiaozhong* (Ch. 241) follows the *Qi* (Qi rhyme) and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its two stanzas; the *Yuan* (Ch. 242) follows the *Zai* (Zai rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme), *Zai* (Zai rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Si* (Si rhyme) in its one and two stanzas.\n\nAgain, in the *Chuci*, the *Lisha* (Ch. 243) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its \"心犹豫而狐疑，怀椒糈而要之\" (The heart is hesitant and dubious, holding fragrant rice and seeking it); \"命灵氛为余占之，孰信修而慕之\" (The spirit of the departed commands the ghost to divine for me, who would believe in virtue and emulate it); the *Tianwen* (Ch. 244) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Mou* (Mou rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *You* (You rhyme), *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), and *Qi* (Qi rhyme); the *Jiuchapter* (Ch. 245) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *You* (You rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Aiying* (Ch. 246) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), the *Chi* (Ch. 247) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) and *Qiou* (Qiu rhyme), the *Simeiren* (Ch. 248) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Qi* (Qi rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Xiwangri* (Ch. 249) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme), *Yi* (Yi rhyme), *Ci* (Ci rhyme), and *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme); the *Jiubian* (Ch. 250) follows the *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) in its two and four instances.\n\nThus, it is known that within the *Wuyingyan*, examples of rhymes with two *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 74), three *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 23, 66, 80), four *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 17), and five *Zhi* (Zhi rhyme) characters (Chapter 49) are hardly exceptional.\n\nSince *Laozi* is a Daoist poetic philosophy, its use of rhyme is more free than that of the *Shijing*. Yet even so, it truly conforms to rhyme. If one were to argue that his writing diverges or does not adhere to rhyme, not only would this fail to capture the resonant beauty of the *Wuyingyan*, but it would also be insufficient to discuss the texts of the other masters.",

      "translated_text": "**(1)** In terms of textual selection, this book primarily relies on the *Laozi* stele from the Tang dynasty’s Longxing Guan in Eizhou, supplemented by Dunhuang manuscripts and the Suizhou stele for cross-verification. For the stone editions, beyond the Imperial Commentary, *Guangming*, and *Jingfu* versions, it also draws on the editions of Lou Zheng, Xing Xuan, Qingyang, Panqi, Gao Yi, and Zhao Mengfu. For the manuscript copies, it references the *Nai* scroll and Sōtō-era manuscripts. For the printed *Wang* edition, besides the *Meiwa* edition by Ue no E, it also consults the Daoist Canon’s *Wang* edition, Fan Yingyuan’s citation of the *Wang* text, and the Song-era *Zhang Taishou* collated edition of the Four Commentaries. For the *He Shang* edition, in addition to the Song-printed version, it incorporates references from Li Daochun’s *Daode Jing Huiyuan*, which uses the plain-text chapter-and-commentary format. Additionally, ancient texts such as the *Fu-Fan* editions, the *Laozi* cited in Xia Jun’s *Guben Sishengyun*, and the falsely attributed Wang Xizhi calligraphic manuscripts are critically evaluated for inclusion.\n\n**(2)** In textual collation, this book primarily follows the 349 variant readings recorded in Yan Kejun’s *Tieqiao Jinshi Po* annotations of the Tang *Laozi*. Wei Jiaosun’s *Jiyutang* stele records either correct Yan’s errors or supplement his omissions, contributing 43 additional readings. Beyond these, it exhaustively gathers the collations of *Laozi* by Ji Yun, Bi Yan, Wang Chang, Wu Yun, as well as Luo Zhenyu’s *Daode Jing Kaoyi* and He Shiji’s *Guben Daode Jing Jiaokan*, ensuring all relevant stele-based corrections are scrutinized to distinguish authenticity from forgery, striving to restore the *Daode Jing* to its original form.\n\n**(3)** In exegesis, this book adopts the interpretations of Wang Renxun, Sun Yiran, Yu Ezhi, Hong Yixian, Liu Shipei, Yi Shunding, Ma Xulun, Tao Hongqing, Xi Dong, Jiang Xichang, Lao Jian, Gao Heng, and Yu Shengwu. It also occasionally incorporates the views of Japanese scholars Ōta Seikan and Takeuchi Yoshio. Marginal annotations are interspersed within the text, sometimes reflecting the author’s own insights, particularly emphasizing phonetic and tonal analysis, drawing on Zhu Jun’s *Shengwen Tongxun Ding Sheng*.\n\n**(4)** In phonology and rhyme, this book primarily follows Jiang Jin’s *Laozi* tonal readings. Where gaps exist, it supplements with Yao Wenti’s *Guyin Xie*, Deng Tingzhen’s *Shuangyan Zhai Biji*, and Li Qianyun’s *Bingzhu Bian*. Liu Shipei’s *Laozi Yunbiao*, Gao Benhan’s *Laozi Yunkao*, as well as Xi Dong and Chen Zhu’s reconstructions of *Laozi*’s ancient pronunciations are largely speculative; only plausible readings are retained, while untenable ones are discarded.\n\n**(5)** This book places particular emphasis on the relationship between Chu dialect and *Laozi*. For instance, in Chapter 45, *“zao sheng han”* (躁勝寒), it cites the *Shiji Fu* annotation that Chu people called fire *“zao”* (燥). In Chapter 55, *“zhong ri hao er bu sha”* (終日號而不嗄), it references Sima Biao’s note in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Gengsang Chu* chapter that Chu people termed extreme exhaustion without sound *“sha”* (嗄). In Chapter 70, *“pi he huai yu”* (披褐懷玉), it draws on the *Huainanzi*’s *Qisú* training annotation that Chu people called a short, coarse robe *“he”* (褐). Such examples are detailed in their respective chapters for the reader’s reference.\n\n**(6)** Upon completion of the initial manuscript, the author benefited greatly from multiple rounds of corrections by Yang Shuda and Ren Jiyu, as well as partial reviews by Liang Qichao and Wang Weicheng.",

Yet even so, it truly conforms to rhyme. If one were to argue that his writing diverges or does not adhere to rhyme, not only would this fail to capture the resonant beauty of the *Wuyingyan*, but it would also be insufficient to discuss the texts of the other masters.",
