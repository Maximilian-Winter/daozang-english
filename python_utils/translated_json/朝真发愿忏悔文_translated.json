Source text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mouth-Karma**\nMay frivolous deceit, flattery, and slander—\ntongues that twist and words that wound—cease.\nLet speech align with the Dao and virtue, amending past transgressions,\nso that words accord with Heaven’s heart and the mouth becomes sacred.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Body-Karma**\nMay killing, theft, lust, and perverse acts be absolved;\ncompassion, integrity, and uprightness open the way to the divine.\nThus is the body made pure and naturally pristine,\nforever shielded by the Four Beasts and the hundred spirits.\n\n**Incantation for Purifying the Mind-Karma**\nThe realm of the Dao is clear and bright, free of defilement;\ngreed, wrath, and delusion are called demonic and perverse.\nStill the mind, extinguish thoughts, and equal the void—\nthis is the Great Luo’s formless realm.\n\n**Prayer for the Incense**\nThe divine transforms without limit, and sincerity reaches it;\nwith earnest heart, prayers are conveyed through the incense.\nFragrant clouds form a canopy over the Great Luo Heaven,\nwhile immortal banners drift in the void, responding to devotion.\n\n**Prayer to the Merit Officers**\nWe invoke the Merit Officers and Direct Talisman Envoys,\nand the local earth gods, most numinous.\nAscending to Heaven, descending to Earth, traversing the hidden and manifest,\nthey transmit offerings and incense, making our pleas heard by sages and worthies.\n\n**Invocation of the Sacred**\nWith one heart, we prostrate and pay homage:\nto the Heavenly Numinous Treasure, the Great Compassionate Honored One,\nthe Nine Luminaries of the Dark Vault and all Imperial Perfected,\nthe Golden Mother and Wooden Lord, the ministers and aides,\nthe sun, moon, and stars who govern destiny,\nthe talismans, scriptures, and Dao—all true writings,\nthe Five Venerables, the Three Officials, and the Great Lords,\nthe Four Saints, the Four Ministers, and the Great Dharma Masters,\nthose who transmit the Dao, the Dharma, and the scriptures and registers,\nthe illustrious patriarchs who propagated the lineages,\nthe true spirits who govern all ritual divisions,\nthe thunder deities, the officials of Mount Feng and the Dark Capital,\nthe infinite immortals and perfected of the ten directions—\nmay all deign to respond and descend to this sacred precinct.\nWith compassion, guide those who study immortality,\nthat they may fulfill their vows and attain the supreme Dao.\n\n**Recitation and Dedication**\nThe merit of the scripture’s power is inconceivable;\nwe dedicate it to the sagely hosts of the ten directions.\nMay they witness our sincerity in seeking repentance,\nand may the river-sands of karmic obstacles be wholly dissolved.\n\n**Repentance and Vows**\nWe repent for ourselves—\nfrom countless kalpas past to this present life—\nhaving taken form from the union of fire, wind, earth, and water,\nyet clinging to fragrance, taste, form, and sound, thus touching the dharmas.\nGreed, wrath, delusion, and jealousy;\nharsh speech and reckless words;\nkilling, theft, perverse lust, and wanton indulgence;\ndisrespect toward parents, betrayal of lords and teachers;\ndisregard for Heaven and Earth’s spirits, cursing wind and rain;\ndenial of karmic cause and effect, deceiving others and oneself against reason—\nall have led to retribution, rising and falling in the wheel of rebirth,\nenduring unceasing suffering in endless cycles.\nAll stems from a single misguided thought, deluding our true nature,\nmistaking the illusions of the six senses and drowning in the river of desire.\n\nNow, having attained a human body and encountered the true teaching,\nis this not a thousand lifetimes’ fortune, a once-in-an-age encounter?\nWe ought to reflect deeply and seek liberation early.\nIf we drift as before, we will forever lose our original nature,\nplunging into the dark paths and transforming into other beings.\n\nThus, contemplating the suffering of sinking, we arouse a pure mind,\ntake refuge in the sagely and perfected, and earnestly seek repentance,\nbegging for mercy on our ignorance, forgiveness for our transgressions,\nthe dissolution of karmic ties, and the dispelling of demonic snares.\nWe pray that our lives meet with prosperous fortune,\nour names be inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace,\nthat we encounter true teachers and personally hear the supreme Dao,\ncultivate wondrous practices, nurture the seed of goodness,\ndevote ourselves to the Mystery Gate, and delight in the true realm.\n\nWhen the time comes for our destined end,\nmay our true nature avoid confusion and be reborn in a family of the ten virtues.\nMay we recover past-life memories and reattain the supreme vehicle,\nserving the August Void Emperor.\nWe further vow for the nation’s peace and the people’s prosperity,\nfor seasons harmonious and harvests abundant.\nMay the true wind flourish and the Dao’s transformation prevail;\nmay the wicked be reformed and demons return to rectitude.\nMay weapons and punishments be set aside, prisons stand empty;\nmay the lowly be raised and enmities reconciled.\nMay those who study the mysteries enter the Dao and attain perfection;\nmay all karmically connected kin be equally delivered.\nMay past-life teachers and friends together realize the true and constant;\nmay all conditions bring increased blessings and wisdom.\nMay all harmed beings swiftly ascend to human or heavenly realms;\nmay we abstain from meat, wine, and killing.\nMay we maintain bodily integrity, avoiding lust and perversity;\nmay we shatter stinginess and greed, removing all obstacles.\nMay our words be free of deceit, our conduct prizing sincerity;\nmay we yield to others, silently enduring anger.\nMay we cultivate a compassionate heart, humble our breath,\nand revere all beings.\nMay we not fall among barbarians nor follow perverse views;\nmay we befriend immortals and dwell in purity and emptiness.\nMay wisdom and insight awaken, spiritual powers expand;\nmay we widely practice expedient means, universally saving all beings.\nMay we forever sever delusion and all return to the supreme Dao.\nThough kalpas may end, our vows are boundless.\nWe earnestly beseech the Imperial Perfected to graciously grant deliverance.\nWe prostrate, pay homage, and give thanks to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.\n\n**Prayer of Gratitude**\nAll the merits of our recitations and rites\nrely entirely on compassion as their foundation.\nGazing upward, we see the immortal banners vanish into the void,\nwhile the true spirits of the Dharma divisions forever guard and protect.\nWe bow our heads and take refuge in the Boundless Wondrous Dao.\n\n*Morning Audience with the Perfected: Vows and Repentance Text*",
