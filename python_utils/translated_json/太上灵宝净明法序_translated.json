  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Method**\n\nThe *Pure Brightness Method* is a concealed scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Capital and Jade Capital. In ancient times, the True Lord of Grand Yang, the Luminous King of Filial Dao, attained the supreme Dao through the radiance of filial virtue, illuminating the earth below. Thereupon, the Supreme Emperor of Supreme Clarity descended into the Hall of the Divine of Fusang Grotto, summoned the Luminous King, and expounded the Dharma to verify him, appointing him as the foremost disciple. He was titled the Great Perfected of the Numinous Treasure, the Jade Clarity’s Decreed Envoy, to deliver salvation in that era. Thus, the Perfected One vowed a great oath, pledging to dwell in the Eastern Limit to rescue all beings. This is known as the Numinous Treasure Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy—such was the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of the Red Brightness era.\n\nIt is called *Pure Brightness*: \"pure\" means no darkness remains unilluminated, no speck of dust defiles; \"bright\" means all, from the foolish to the wise, look up to it. It is the gateway to liberation, the path to transcendence. Filial piety and fraternal duty serve as its standard; cultivation and refinement, its methods; and the secret essentials of practice, its core. Through accumulation and mutual enhancement, wisdom is honed, and only then does the Dao-qi become firm and complete, spirits and humans submit to service. In a single breath, one may grasp the profound principle.\n\nI once admired the winds of the Dao, seeking the teachings of masters far and wide, storing them in heart and mind with unwavering resolve. After receiving the full transmission of the method, I studied diligently, and my merit and practice reached fruition. Later, I encountered a supreme sage who transmitted this scripture to me, and thus its art was perfected. As for the wondrous traces of divine favor and transcendence bestowed upon me, they cannot be fully recounted.\n\nThose who obtain this book must not neglect themselves, for all are heirs to ten generations of accumulation, gradually ascending toward transcendence. I once composed a modest work, the *Scripture of the Dao* in thirty-five chapters, which circulated among the world, yet few attained it. How much more so this pivotal mechanism, the sacred register of the supreme sages—how could one dare treat it lightly?\n\nRespectfully inscribed.",
