  "full_translation": "**The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle**\n\n**Title:** *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle*. Author unknown. Three scrolls. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***\n\nAt first, my temple was nourished by the descent upon Sword Ridge, its transmission flowing through the Clear River. With brush in hand, I inscribed twin pines, and all who prayed received responses in dreams. Yet I never disseminated these oracles in the world. Now, the temple officials of the Main Hall and the Family Celebration Tower borrow other oracles as a makeshift measure—such as the *Oracle of the Twelve Perfected Lords*, which is merely the *Oracle of the Venerable Elder of Mount Qingcheng*, or the *Yi* hexagrams used in the Family Celebration Tower, which lack any true verification. Moreover, in the temples of Shu, they employ only the inner and outer oracles of the Vermilion Perfected Lord.\n\nThus, I personally examined and refined their wondrous applications, encompassing the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, as well as the fortunes and adversities of destiny and the unions and separations of human affairs. I entrusted this task to my seven heirs, who, with skillful analogies and clear explanations, composed one hundred and twenty oracles each for the upper, middle, and lower grades. These are arranged by the twelve earthly branches, with thirty oracles for each, and further aligned with the five phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—to form three hundred and sixty-five oracles, corresponding to the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial sphere. May those who seek faith find fulfillment according to their aspirations.\n\n**Preface by the Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens, the Spirit-Responsive August Lord**\n\n---\n\n**Precious Declaration of the August Lord of Literary Destiny, Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens**\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and pay homage to the Jade True Celebration Palace in the Imperial Realm of the Unyielding, where ninety-eight transformations manifest in concealment and revelation, and myriad forms of divine marvels unfold. Through the flight of the phoenix, transformation is revealed in every place; with boundless compassion, calamities are averted and life is preserved across generations. Utmost filial piety and benevolence, your merit spans the Dao, Confucianism, and Buddhism. Neither arrogant nor indulgent, your office fulfills the duties of the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic officials. Your merit and virtue are immeasurable, your majesty and numinosity unfathomable.\n\n**Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Benevolence, Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens, True Lord of Official Rank and Imperial Examinations, August Lord of the Sevenfold Curve, Protector of Virtue and Vast Benevolence, Heavenly Worthy of Eternal Life Who Expounds the Scriptures, Teaches the Dharma, Dispels Calamities, Enacts Transformations, and Renews Existence.**\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***\n\n**First Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Auspicious Gathering of Wind and Cloud – Supreme Fortune**\nA day of ascending peace arrives,\nWith titles and decrees bestowed.\nThe future holds boundless promise,\nAs immortal maidens ride flying dragons.\n\nA golden terrace is built to welcome scholars and summon worthies,\nA cinnabar decree confers honors and rewards merit with noble rank.\nClinging to the dragon and phoenix, one ascends steadily into the azure heavens,\nWhere wind gathers and clouds arise in joyous assembly upon the purple empyrean.\n\n**Second Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Prospects of Success – Supreme Fortune**\nA youth of fine character,\nWisdom surpassing Xiao He.\nPlans unfold as desired,\nBrows relaxed with joy.\n\nCarriages and documents unite under one script, literature and ritual flourish together,\nVirtue knows no peer, benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust are all complete.\nA mere foot and a half from heaven, one kneels to receive the cinnabar decree upon the golden steps,\nAn extraordinary promotion grants imperial favor at the jade throne.\n\n**Third Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Guard Carefully, Lest It Be Lost – Moderate Fortune**\nThough hawks and falcons are sent in pursuit,\nBeware the tigers and leopards’ might.\nDwell simply in the way of the noble,\nWhere can one find idle wrongdoing?\n\nHawks and falcons chase the cunning hare, which hides in the mountains and forests,\nThe might of tigers and leopards deters travelers on the road.\nThe noble one remains tranquil in guarding the Dao, and myriad misfortunes do not encroach,\nThe petty man, restless and self-serving, finds even a single scheme unfulfilled.\n\n**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Success Comes in Due Time – Moderate Fortune**\nA general of a thousand *li*,\nWhose brilliant strategies remain concealed.\nWhere waves surge and clouds roll,\nBlood stains the battle robes anew.\n\nA general of heroic strategy, when his plans are realized, will surely triumph in attack and prevail in battle,\nA person of talent and ambition, when the time is right, will find the Dao flourishing and fame achieved.\nWith strategy in place, victory is not difficult,\nWith the right moment, renown is easily surpassed.\n\n**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes for Success Are Dim – Inferior Fortune**\nA gourd’s laughter echoes,\nSeeking fame through distant schemes.\nLike duckweed adrift on waves,\nWhen will one reach the celestial thoroughfare?\n\nClaiming the nonexistent as real, one exhausts spirit in vain,\nPointing to reality as illusion, one wearies the mind with empty dreams.\nSeeking one matter is like calling for geese amidst floating clouds,\nHoping for another is like drifting duckweed in rushing currents.\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Harmony Between Kin and Friends – Supreme Fortune**\nThe refined households of Wang and Xie,\nThe states of Qin and Jin vie in splendor.\nA guest who plays the flute,\nAdorns himself with phoenix blossoms.\n\nIn the halls of the refined Wang and Xie, purple swallows vie in flight,\nIn the pond of harmonious Qin and Jin, colorful mandarin ducks pair.\nRiding the phoenix and playing the flute, one roams the moonlit heavens,\nDiscussing kinship and striking the zither, one delights in floral adornments among mortals.\n\n**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Repeated Joys – Supreme Fortune**\nThe lotus curtain has just parted,\nAscending once more to the brocade terrace.\nCelebrating the dragon-tiger gathering,\nExceptional talents emerge.\n\nJoy as boundless as the blooming lotus in the azure pond,\nDelight as vivid as the scenery of the brocade hall.\nThe dragon-tiger gathering refines the elixir, and the immortal’s nature is perfected,\nExceptional talents arise to pacify the people and assist the state.\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Change Brings Auspiciousness – Moderate Fortune**\nWhy persist in cramped quarters?\nHarmony and joy arrive in due time.\nEntrusting to fate, all is well,\nWhether high or low, proceed steadily.\n\nA cramped heart finds no ease, and the mind is not at peace,\nWhen the scene changes to harmony, movement brings stability.\nFor destiny has its allotted share—advance and plans will succeed,\nIn all undertakings, there is no doubt: above harmonizes, below follows.\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Affairs Fraught with Deceit – Inferior Fortune**\nA woman already encountered,\nHow can a second be tolerated?\nOnly because obstacles arise everywhere,\nShould one stir winds recklessly.\n\nAffairs are hindered by the meeting of three women,\nCircumstances go awry due to discordant sentiments.\nStill waters rise in waves when wind blows—tranquility is disturbed,\nA peaceful dwelling stirs into misfortune—deception lurks unseen.\n\n**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Internal and External Harmony – Supreme Fortune**\nAffinal kin are already connected,\nFriends share the same tastes.\nFish-shaped letters on silk,\nPreserve the customs of many households.\n\n**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Holding to Adversity Before Prosperity – Moderate Fortune**\nHarmony in affinal bonds—goodwill meets and sentiments flow,\nUnity in shared tastes—joyful plans bring affairs to fruition.\nFish and wild geese bear glad tidings, delighting within and harmonizing without,\nThe household preserves its blessings, sweeping away misfortune—above follows, below obeys.\n\n**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Holding to Adversity Before Prosperity – Moderate Fortune**\nStripped bare, renewal begins; when the time is right, the path opens.\nGuard your conduct to avoid loss,\nRecklessness must not be repeated.\nSix yin reach their extreme—at the darkest hour, yang qi stirs to life,\nThe Dao, when exhausted, transforms: adversity turns to prosperity.\nThe principle of closure and openness cycles—there is flourishing, there is decline,\nThe mechanism of yin and yang—there is growth, there is decay.\n\n**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes Blocked and Obstructed – Inferior Fortune**\nA long sojourner finds no road home,\nFerries and bridges miss their time.\nStanding on the terrace gazing toward home,\nWhat is seen but rugged peaks?\nThe traveler’s longing stretches to the ends of the earth,\nHopes for success meet rivers too distant, mountains too high.\nClimbing perilous heights brings hardship—paths are treacherous, roads are dangerous,\nYearning for word brings only silence—no raven’s cry, no fish’s trace.\n\n**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Great Auspices Ahead – Supreme Fortune**\nClouds disperse, the moon shines anew,\nWind stills, waves do not rise.\nThe bank is high, the boat crosses of itself,\nClapping hands, the whole household prospers.\nDark clouds suddenly scatter—a full moon reveals its radiance,\nMisfortune vanishes in an instant—a thousand miles lie smooth and level ahead.\nAdvance in one matter, advance without hindrance—wind and waves are calm,\nPlan one thing, plan with success—joyful songs and clapping hands.\n\n**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Auspicious News Expected – Supreme Fortune**\nThe lamp forms layered blossoms,\nThe pond’s lotuses bloom with rare flowers.\nOnly because harmonious qi overflows,\nGlad tidings arrive from afar.\nThe lamp’s blossoms herald distant joy,\nThe pond’s lotuses bring delight to human affairs.\nThe misty harmony of qi rises, blessing all things with abundance,\nAuspicious clouds and propitious mists shelter the household with well-being.\n\n**Fifteenth Oracle

arrives late with laughter.\nThe courtyard’s dead tree suddenly puts forth flourishing boughs,\nThe garden’s fading flowers happily bear peach and plum.\nHoped-for matters come unexpectedly to fruition—success is assured,\nAnxieties dissolve by chance—harm is averted.\n\n**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Greatly Favorable for Advancement – Supreme Fortune**\nOsmanthus seeds are richly fragrant,\nJade and jasper gleam in the jade hall.\nWith the wind’s aid,\nClimb and soar.\nJade and jasper reflect the pure light of heaven and earth,\nRock osmanthus blooms, filling the cosmos with its golden fragrance.\nThe wind’s power carries one straight to the heavens—soaring for ten thousand miles,\nDivine favor assists the journey—prosperity and peace attend the whole person.\n\n**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Aspirations Fulfilled – Supreme Fortune**\nWind drives upward to the azure sky,\nThe roc beats its six wings in autumn.\nA letter arrives from beyond the clouds,\nIn one stroke, one seizes the turtle’s head.\nAspirations for fame soar like the osprey taking flight in autumn,\nPlans for gain prosper like orioles and swallows singing in spring gardens.\nOne gust of wind scatters the clouds—a thousand miles of carefree ease,\nOne endeavor, with divine aid—all things proceed smoothly to fulfillment.\n\n**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Delayed Success – Moderate Fortune**\nLaughter follows tears,\nYet not a hair is lost.\nCrossing the boat will bring success,\nThe river is calm, free of wind and waves.\nFirst wailing, then laughter—sorrow gives way to joy,\nBeginning with obstruction, ending in success—loss brings gain.\nWhen the river is calm, waves are stilled, wind is quiet—affairs are peaceful, the heart is at ease,\nWhen there is deliverance, the time has come, fortune arrives—escaping disaster, emerging from stagnation.\n\n**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Abundant Blessings – Supreme Fortune**\nA sharp sword cuts like a breath,\nClouds rise high, mountains rise higher.\nThis body knows no obstruction,\nWhy shirk labor in food and rest?\nThe Dao’s virtue spreads wide, high as the sacred peaks,\nAffairs proceed swiftly, sharp as a sword that severs hair.\nWith blessings and strength, with plans—persevere without ceasing,\nNo obstructions, nothing fails to pass—naturally, all is accomplished.\n\n**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Peril and No Success – Inferior Fortune**\nThe ox’s tail splits,\nHow can the chicken’s beak bear sorrow?\nHoping for someone, no one is seen,\nTurning back, affairs will be delayed.\nThe ox, creature of plowing—when its tail splits, fields lie fallow,\nThe chicken, herald of dawn—when its beak grieves, the household faces calamity.\nWhat is hoped for is delayed, obstructed,\nWhat is pursued is pressed, unfulfilled.\n\n**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes and News Both Lost – Inferior Fortune**\nHeartless, resenting broken promises,\nWind and peril, yet no boat,\nThe sun darkens, the road is lost,\nMist and clouds veil the azure sky.\nFacing late spring, heartless and resentful—flowers fall, waters flow,\nGazing at the Yangtze, waves rise, no boat—spirit fades, soul scatters.\nThe red sun sets, the way home is lost—sorrow weighs on the heart,\nAzure clouds obscure, still separating—parting thoughts sink deep.\n\n**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Advancing Toward Success – Supreme Fortune**\nThe autumn moon is perfectly round,\nClouds part, light fills the river.\nEvery household knows no hindrance,\nThe river mirrors a single blue sky.\nClouds part, the sky clears—the moon’s brilliance shines like a flawless mirror,\nDisaster retreats, blessings arise—the household

– Laborious Success – Moderate Fortune**\nOre exhausted, true gold appears,\nShoots grow, the soil’s depth is known.\nThe path to blue clouds will open,\nDo not sigh over toilsome labor.\nGold emerges from ore—without refining, it cannot become treasure,\nTrue immortals are born of mortal flesh—without merit and practice, they cannot attain the Dao.\nTimely cultivation brings bountiful harvests,\nDiligent labor brings no fear—plans come to fruition.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – No Deception, Hopes Fulfilled – Moderate Fortune**\nThe moon is veiled by drifting

ever-increasing without end,\nFortune and rank rise together, bringing timely aid.\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Success in Affairs – Supreme Fortune**\nYears of nurturing build the foundation,\nWind and cloud await their moment to stir.\nTogether they open the Dragon-Tiger path—\nWhat day will not bring a marquis’s seal?\nA tree of great girth is not nurtured in a single day,\nA marquis’s enfeoffment is the reward of meritorious deeds.\nWhen the tiger roars, wind fills the valley—majestic power is complete,\nWhen the dragon intones, clouds spread across the sky—thunder rolls, rain descends.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Legal Matters Resolved – Moderate Fortune**\nLegal troubles stretch on endlessly,\nHow many months will the delay endure?\nOnly by upholding fairness and justice,\nCan one escape the woes of imprisonment.\nLitigation ends in misfortune yet turns to fortune—do not rely on deceit,\nAffairs first in chaos, then in peace—be cautious and steadfast.\nThough principle rests in righteousness, escape comes first,\nTo leave behind prolonged entanglement is the highest good.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Stubbornness Blocks Progress – Wretched Fortune**\nThe strong and weak clamor in vain,\nLonely and rugged, the door remains shut.\nSecluded, with no path forward,\nHunger and cold endure till dusk.\nWithout righteousness or benevolence, how is this different from the strong oppressing the weak?\nWith greed and desire, it is like the rich devouring the poor.\nAbove and below, harmony is wounded—alone in seclusion,\nWithin and without, resentment arises—isolated in cold and hunger.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – All Affairs Unfulfilled – Wretched Fortune**\nThe boat is hindered by rocks in the waves,\nA traveler on foot fears crossing the river.\nClouds hang high, mountains are perilous—\nIn sorrow and solitude, what can be done?\nPlans are fraught with fear—rocks in the water block the boat,\nIntentions are anxious—a tiger at the mountain’s base bars the traveler.\nPerils and obstacles prevent progress, no strength to climb,\nDistress and hardship breed only sorrow—when will success come?\n\n**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Pray for Blessing, Avoid Disaster – Moderate Fortune**\nThe path of bodhi lies open,\nEvery household shares in the incense’s bond.\nTo escape the snare’s calamity,\nA clear, boundless sky appears.\nThose of utmost goodness swiftly reach the bodhi path,\nCultivators of truth ascend the gate of joy.\nWith a heart free of entanglement, the body escapes the net,\nWith mind held in reverence, how can affairs be hindered?\n\n**First Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Seek and You Shall Obtain – Moderate Fortune**\nGain and loss drift in vagueness,\nIdle worries stretch long.\nDo not shirk from diligent care—\nGold and jade will fill the chests again.\nGain and loss follow the law of ebb and flow—no need for concern,\nRise and decline

away,\nExhausted strength cannot sustain.\nThe Three Worms raise their heads—\nWithout blood, there is no end to sorrow.\nA grave illness cannot be cured—it is truly heaven’s disaster,\nA lingering affliction drags on—is this not fate’s decree?\nMoreover, the Three Worms feed on blood—beware their venomous peril,\nThe Two Mouths may strike the heart—surely this brings mortal danger.\n\n**Sixth

left unfulfilled.\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Medicine and Stone Ineffective – Wretched Fortune**\nThe illness has entered the vital organs,\nEven Bian Que’s methods cannot be applied.\nMedicine and stone are not bitter to the mouth—\nA thousand miles away, one remedy is hard to find.\nThe disease has reached the critical stage—hanging in peril,\nEven refined medicine lacks miraculous effect.\nThough Lu’s physician or Bian Que could not administer a cure,\nEven the finest elixir or divine pill could not save the afflicted.\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Grievances Remain Unresolved – Wretched Fortune**\nOnly because thorns have grown,\nJackals and wolves now threaten even the descendants.\nIn the courtyard, the candlelit night—\nAshes grow cold, half a spark remains.\nThorns of resentment arise from hatred—calamity reaches the descendants,\nWild abandon born of excess and indulgence—harm befalls oneself.\n\n**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou –

labor, like Kongming’s steadfast devotion.\n\n**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Great Favor in Promotion – Most Auspicious**\nNot for the sake of fine prose is one exalted,\nHow could one know of an unexpected rise?\nIf one speaks of a coveted post,\nThe body draws near the Purple Tenuity.\n\nRefined writings shine bright, names inscribed on the golden roll,\nScholarship profound, the self

Ease After Long Hardship – Neutral**\nThe困 dragon coils long in the mire,\nThe mountain low, the tiger’s path lost.\nGradually climbing through clouds and mist,\nThe red sun has not yet set in the west.\n\nThe flood dragon, denied clouds and rain, lies trapped in secluded crags,\nThe leopard and tiger, lost in the wilds, lurk in the undergrowth.\nThe noble one, dwelling in cultivation, finds the Dao flourishing—advancement assured,\nThe scholar, refining his craft, awaits the hour—merit and fame will naturally appear.\n\n**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Stranded and Unbearable – Most Inauspicious**\nWhen will the many ailments heal?\nMist and waves bar the distant road.\nThe horse weary, the traveler spent,\nThe waning sun, the howling fox and ape.\n\nThe heart finds no joy,

arduous.\nBut if one yields to the heavens’ timing,\nWhat place lacks tranquility?\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Eventual Relief – Neutral**\nHuman feelings are as fraught as

      "translated_text": "**The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle**\n\n**Title:** *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle*. Author unknown. Three scrolls. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***\n\nAt first, my temple was nourished by the descent upon Sword Ridge, its transmission flowing through the Clear River. With brush in hand, I inscribed twin pines, and all who prayed received responses in dreams. Yet I never disseminated these oracles in the world. Now, the temple officials of the Main Hall and the Family Celebration Tower borrow other oracles as a makeshift measure—such as the *Oracle of the Twelve Perfected Lords*, which is merely the *Oracle of the Venerable Elder of Mount Qingcheng*, or the *Yi* hexagrams used in the Family Celebration Tower, which lack any true verification. Moreover, in the temples of Shu, they employ only the inner and outer oracles of the Vermilion Perfected Lord.\n\nThus, I personally examined and refined their wondrous applications, encompassing the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, as well as the fortunes and adversities of destiny and the unions and separations of human affairs. I entrusted this task to my seven heirs, who, with skillful analogies and clear explanations, composed one hundred and twenty oracles each for the upper, middle, and lower grades. These are arranged by the twelve earthly branches, with thirty oracles for each, and further aligned with the five phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—to form three hundred and sixty-five oracles, corresponding to the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial sphere. May those who seek faith find fulfillment according to their aspirations.\n\n**Preface by the Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens, the Spirit-Responsive August Lord**\n\n---\n\n**Precious Declaration of the August Lord of Literary Destiny, Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens**\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and pay homage to the Jade True Celebration Palace in the Imperial Realm of the Unyielding, where ninety-eight transformations manifest in concealment and revelation, and myriad forms of divine marvels unfold. Through the flight of the phoenix, transformation is revealed in every place; with boundless compassion, calamities are averted and life is preserved across generations. Utmost filial piety and benevolence, your merit spans the Dao, Confucianism, and Buddhism. Neither arrogant nor indulgent, your office fulfills the duties of the celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic officials. Your merit and virtue are immeasurable, your majesty and numinosity unfathomable.\n\n**Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Benevolence, Sovereign of Revealed Transformation of the Nine Heavens, True Lord of Official Rank and Imperial Examinations, August Lord of the Sevenfold Curve, Protector of Virtue and Vast Benevolence, Heavenly Worthy of Eternal Life Who Expounds the Scriptures, Teaches the Dharma, Dispels Calamities, Enacts Transformations, and Renews Existence.**\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Mysterious True Spirit-Responsive Auspicious Oracle***\n\n**First Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Auspicious Gathering of Wind and Cloud – Supreme Fortune**\nA day of ascending peace arrives,\nWith titles and decrees bestowed.\nThe future holds boundless promise,\nAs immortal maidens ride flying dragons.\n\nA golden terrace is built to welcome scholars and summon worthies,\nA cinnabar decree confers honors and rewards merit with noble rank.\nClinging to the dragon and phoenix, one ascends steadily into the azure heavens,\nWhere wind gathers and clouds arise in joyous assembly upon the purple empyrean.\n\n**Second Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Prospects of Success – Supreme Fortune**\nA youth of fine character,\nWisdom surpassing Xiao He.\nPlans unfold as desired,\nBrows relaxed with joy.\n\nCarriages and documents unite under one script, literature and ritual flourish together,\nVirtue knows no peer, benevolence and righteousness, loyalty and trust are all complete.\nA mere foot and a half from heaven, one kneels to receive the cinnabar decree upon the golden steps,\nAn extraordinary promotion grants imperial favor at the jade throne.\n\n**Third Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Guard Carefully, Lest It Be Lost – Moderate Fortune**\nThough hawks and falcons are sent in pursuit,\nBeware the tigers and leopards’ might.\nDwell simply in the way of the noble,\nWhere can one find idle wrongdoing?\n\nHawks and falcons chase the cunning hare, which hides in the mountains and forests,\nThe might of tigers and leopards deters travelers on the road.\nThe noble one remains tranquil in guarding the Dao, and myriad misfortunes do not encroach,\nThe petty man, restless and self-serving, finds even a single scheme unfulfilled.\n\n**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Success Comes in Due Time – Moderate Fortune**\nA general of a thousand *li*,\nWhose brilliant strategies remain concealed.\nWhere waves surge and clouds roll,\nBlood stains the battle robes anew.\n\nA general of heroic strategy, when his plans are realized, will surely triumph in attack and prevail in battle,\nA person of talent and ambition, when the time is right, will find the Dao flourishing and fame achieved.\nWith strategy in place, victory is not difficult,\nWith the right moment, renown is easily surpassed.\n\n**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Hopes for Success Are Dim – Inferior Fortune**\nA gourd’s laughter echoes,\nSeeking fame through distant schemes.\nLike duckweed adrift on waves,\nWhen will one reach the celestial thoroughfare?\n\nClaiming the nonexistent as real, one exhausts spirit in vain,\nPointing to reality as illusion, one wearies the mind with empty dreams.\nSeeking one matter is like calling for geese amidst floating clouds,\nHoping for another is like drifting duckweed in rushing currents.\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Harmony Between Kin and Friends – Supreme Fortune**\nThe refined households of Wang and Xie,\nThe states of Qin and Jin vie in splendor.\nA guest who plays the flute,\nAdorns himself with phoenix blossoms.\n\nIn the halls of the refined Wang and Xie, purple swallows vie in flight,\nIn the pond of harmonious Qin and Jin, colorful mandarin ducks pair.\nRiding the phoenix and playing the flute, one roams the moonlit heavens,\nDiscussing kinship and striking the zither, one delights in floral adornments among mortals.\n\n**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Repeated Joys – Supreme Fortune**\nThe lotus curtain has just parted,\nAscending once more to the brocade terrace.\nCelebrating the dragon-tiger gathering,\nExceptional talents emerge.\n\nJoy as boundless as the blooming lotus in the azure pond,\nDelight as vivid as the scenery of the brocade hall.\nThe dragon-tiger gathering refines the elixir, and the immortal’s nature is perfected,\nExceptional talents arise to pacify the people and assist the state.\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Change Brings Auspiciousness – Moderate Fortune**\nWhy persist in cramped quarters?\nHarmony and joy arrive in due time.\nEntrusting to fate, all is well,\nWhether high or low, proceed steadily.\n\nA cramped heart finds no ease, and the mind is not at peace,\nWhen the scene changes to harmony, movement brings stability.\nFor destiny has its allotted share—advance and plans will succeed,\nIn all undertakings, there is no doubt: above harmonizes, below follows.\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Affairs Fraught with Deceit – Inferior Fortune**\nA woman already encountered,\nHow can a second be tolerated?\nOnly because obstacles arise everywhere,\nShould one stir winds recklessly.\n\nAffairs are hindered by the meeting of three women,\nCircumstances go awry due to discordant sentiments.\nStill waters rise in waves when wind blows—tranquility is disturbed,\nA peaceful dwelling stirs into misfortune—deception lurks unseen.\n\n**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Internal and External Harmony – Supreme Fortune**\nAffinal kin are already connected,\nFriends share the same tastes.\nFish-shaped letters on silk,\nPreserve the customs of many households.",

the sky—thunder rolls, rain descends.\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Legal Matters Resolved – Moderate Fortune**\nLegal troubles stretch on endlessly,\nHow many months will the delay endure?\nOnly by upholding fairness and justice,\nCan one escape the woes of imprisonment.\nLitigation ends in misfortune yet turns to fortune—do not rely on deceit,\nAffairs first in chaos, then in peace—be cautious and steadfast.\nThough principle rests in righteousness, escape comes first,\nTo leave behind prolonged entanglement is the highest good.\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Stubbornness Blocks Progress – Wretched Fortune**\nThe strong and weak clamor in vain,\nLonely and rugged, the door remains shut.\nSecluded, with no path forward,\nHunger and cold endure till dusk.\nWithout righteousness or benevolence, how is this different from the strong oppressing the weak?\nWith greed and desire, it is like the rich devouring the poor.\nAbove and below, harmony is wounded—alone in seclusion,\nWithin and without, resentment arises—isolated in cold and hunger.\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – All Affairs Unfulfilled – Wretched Fortune**\nThe boat is hindered by rocks in the waves,\nA traveler on foot fears crossing the river.\nClouds hang high, mountains are perilous—\nIn sorrow and solitude, what can be done?\nPlans are fraught with fear—rocks in the water block the boat,\nIntentions are anxious—a tiger at the mountain’s base bars the traveler.\nPerils and obstacles prevent progress, no strength to climb,\nDistress and hardship breed only sorrow—when will success come?\n\n**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Zi – Pray for Blessing, Avoid Disaster – Moderate Fortune**\nThe path of bodhi lies open,\nEvery household shares in the incense’s bond.\nTo escape the snare’s calamity,\nA clear, boundless sky appears.\nThose of utmost goodness swiftly reach the bodhi path,\nCultivators of truth ascend the gate of joy.\nWith a heart free of entanglement, the body escapes the net,\nWith mind held in reverence, how can affairs be hindered?\n\n**First Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Seek and You Shall Obtain – Moderate Fortune**\nGain and loss drift in vagueness,\nIdle worries stretch long.\nDo not shirk from diligent care—\nGold and jade will fill the chests again.\nGain and loss follow the law of ebb and flow—no need for concern,\nRise and decline are the natural order—why trouble the mind?\nNo affair succeeds without seeking,\nNo rice ripens without planting.\n\n**Second Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Affairs Align with the Heart – Moderate Fortune**\nRed and green linger to keep spring,\nThe beauty’s affection grows deeper.\nWith hairpins still fragrant,\nLaughter and song rise from the grassy mat.\nHarmony in agreement—no affair is not joyful,\nShared insight—all uses naturally grow close.\nIncense not yet burned, new coils add their fragrance, mist swirling,\nWine not yet finished, new cups are poured—hearts delight in choice.\n\n**Third Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Promotion in Rank – Supreme Fortune**\nSpring arrives in an instant in the celestial garden,\nBefore the courtyard, flowers and willows renew.\nThe marketplace buzzes with kind words,\nEven grasses and trees rejoice.\nThe faint rumble of spring thunder—what was buried stirs, what was low rises,\nYang qi begins to flourish—willows sprout buds, flowers burst from calyxes.\nKind words spread good tidings throughout the land,\nJoyful faces carry glad news to every door.\n\n**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Wealth and Silk Bring Joy – Supreme Fortune**\nOnce I grieved over the times,\nNow spring blooms in the grass and flowers.\nGrain is abundant everywhere,\nMelons and plums ripen all at once.\nThe times are favorable, fortune prospers—now is right, the past is wrong,\nThe year’s end passes, spring returns—grass sprouts, flowers bloom.\nMelons and plums ripen, bearing fruit—together we celebrate the new season,\nGrain is plentiful, households are provided—universal blessings abound.\n\n**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Illness Befalls the Body – Wretched Fortune**\nHeaven’s calamity cannot be prayed away,\nExhausted strength cannot sustain.\nThe Three Worms raise their heads—\nWithout blood, there is no end to sorrow.\nA grave illness cannot be cured—it is truly heaven’s disaster,\nA lingering affliction drags on—is this not fate’s decree?\nMoreover, the Three Worms feed on blood—beware their venomous peril,\nThe Two Mouths may strike the heart—surely this brings mortal danger.\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Minor Joys Appear – Moderate Fortune**\nAt ease, following true nature,\nAmid flowers, lightly adorned.\nLaughing and singing in the candlelit night,\nGuests gather around the feast in warmth.\nThe body is free, the heart unburdened—carefree in natural joy,\nThe path of the Dao winds through subtle mysteries—at ease in the world.\nWildflowers and grasses, untouched by a speck of dust,\nLamps lit, the banquet set—countless bonds of kinship.\n\n**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Cautious Affairs Bring Small Success – Supreme Fortune**\nDo not fret over empty, restless thoughts,\nGo forth—do not sink into despair.\nFortunately, the times change—\nPrecious treasures bring joy in gold.\nBoard the merchant’s boat to seek fame and profit—it will not return empty,\nRely on goods to seek wealth—there will be no loss.\nAwaiting change, the times prosper, the year is favorable—nothing is blocked,\nGaining gold, profit is rich, wealth is abundant—nothing is left unfulfilled.\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Medicine and Stone Ineffective – Wretched Fortune**\nThe illness has entered the vital organs,\nEven Bian Que’s methods cannot be applied.\nMedicine and stone are not bitter to the mouth—\nA thousand miles away, one remedy is hard to find.\nThe disease has reached the critical stage—hanging in peril,\nEven refined medicine lacks miraculous effect.\nThough Lu’s physician or Bian Que could not administer a cure,\nEven the finest elixir or divine pill could not save the afflicted.\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Chou – Grievances Remain Unresolved – Wretched Fortune**\nOnly because thorns have grown,\nJackals and wolves now threaten even the descendants.\nIn the courtyard, the candlelit night—\nAshes grow cold, half a spark remains.\nThorns of resentment arise from hatred—calamity reaches the descendants,\nWild abandon born of excess and indulgence—harm befalls oneself.",

recluse’s heart knows no delight,\nHow may weariness ever take flight?\n\nSpirit weary, will exhausted, faces the west wind’s mournful sway;\nAffairs clumsy, plans awry, sighs at leaves parting their spray.\nTo cast aside yet cannot—like fowl played with in vain;\nTo seek yet cannot—like mistaking geese for broth’s gain.\n\n**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hopes Unfulfilled – Most Inauspicious**\n\nStars and moon show faintest light,\nDim radiance leaves affairs unclear.\nThe pavilion’s guest departs in haste,\nHeart’s burdens vex the spirit’s grace.\n\nThe new moon rises, yet no fullness in cassia’s glow is seen;\nThe heart’s desire unmet, still tangled in discord’s sheen.\nOld friends depart swiftly, sorrow of parting weighs the breast;\nAffairs disturb the mind, hardship and hindrance block the quest.\n\n**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Stagnation Now Eases – Most Auspicious**\n\nWithered trees meet spring anew,\nFragrance fills the dawn’s own hue.\nWith you I share this joyful sight,\nAnd follow time’s renewing light.\n\nRoots’ wood meets spring’s breeze—leaves flourish, branches thrive;\nThe virtuous meet fate’s favor—names rise, ranks arrive.\nThough freed from long stagnation, virtue’s path is walked anew;\nFortune’s hour now shines—fragrance shared in joyful view.\n\n**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Ills Fade, Sickness Leaves – Middling**\n\nLong bound by lingering ailment’s chain,\nWorries deep as demons’ reign.\nSuddenly good medicine appears,\nLightly soaring through clouded spheres.\n\nEndless stagnation like a chronic malady’s embrace;\nLayered sorrows like dwelling in a desolate place.\nA potent remedy arrives—illness retreats, health restored;\nA noble guide lifts one beyond the common horde.\n\n**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – From Misfortune to Blessing – Most Inauspicious**\n\nA lone traveler sets out by night,\nClouds dim, the moon’s pale light.\nOnly regret fills the desolate air,\nTurning back finds no refuge there.\n\nThe lone traveler departs as night deepens, the moon descends;\nThe troubled soul acts—plans flawed, schemes unamend.\nTo press onward brings unseen peril’s dread;\nTo retreat offers scant safety instead.\n\n**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Advancement Ahead – Most Auspicious**\n\nLiterary triumph brings return,\nGrace bestows robes of honor earned.\nRadiance shines with growing might,\nFortune and rank in union bright.\n\nTriumph in the literary field—success as easy as plucking grass;\nAdvancement in court—favor bright as the sun’s vast pass.\nVirtue flourishes, rank and glory rise;\nFortune and blessing make the household thrive.\n\n**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Inner and Outer Turmoil – Most Inauspicious**\n\nSilent, seated in the empty hall,\nA troubled heart remains in thrall.\nHow bear the paths of men and ghosts,\nAs household affairs bring ceaseless woes?\n\nWithin, discord stirs from family strife;\nWithout, affairs bring no peace in life.\nGrief knots the heart—ghosts and men sigh in despair;\nSilent resentment grows—joy scarce, sorrow fills the air.\n\n**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Peace and Blessing Settle – Most Auspicious**\n\nAt dawn, a single incense burns,\nHeaven’s will guards and safety turns.\nTurn the heart to the great Dao,\nBlessings naturally ever grow.\n\nMorning prayers seek the household’s peace;\nSincerity through night brings lengthened ease.\nOne good deed draws a hundred spirits’ aid, blessings align;\nOne evil act—ten thousand woes dispelled, faults forgiven, divine.\n\n**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Heart’s Distance, Affairs Delayed – Middling**\n\nA thousand bushels weigh the ship down,\nWaves still clog the ford’s renown.\nA thousand-mile ambition stored,\nYet not a single pole’s accord.\n\nThe boat grounded on shoals—no oar may stir, no startle’s sound;\nAffairs meet obstruction—no progress may be found.\nA thousand-mile ambition, yet each step meets delay;\nA hundred schemes devised—what use, what way?\n\n**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Sincerity and Fate at Odds – Most Inauspicious**\n\nThe child lacks cunning’s art,\nDim wit cannot play its part.\nGuard what little will remains,\nTill white-haired, home he gains.\n\nThe child’s mind lacks wisdom’s spark;\nThe dull man’s measure falls too dark.\nMissed chances—talent fades, name falls, white-haired, no gain;\nGreat folly—plans awry, shame’s blush brings no relief’s chain.\n\n**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hearing Sorrow, Yet Unmoved – Middling**\n\nOne leans on the western tower,\nAutumn deep, the flute’s notes sour.\nOnly gaze, need not grieve,\nNo need for sorrow to weave.\n\nSorrow stirs at the flute’s mournful sound;\nWorries rise at the wild geese’s cry unbound.\nRelease the sorrow—grief turns to cheer;\nCalm the heart—fears dissolve, joy draws near.\n\n**Twenty-Second Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Hearing Joy, Yet Unmoved – Middling**\n\nA lone goose bears empty news,\nFalse tidings, no voice ensues.\nLaughing words of joy and woe,\nAll in vain, mere hearsay’s show.\n\nWhat is heard—false joy’s report, whence can joy arise?\nWhat is seen—empty flowers, no substance lies.\nVain boasts of praise—no deeds to show;\nEmpty regrets—resentment’s sting will grow.\n\n**Twenty-Third Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Fortune Comes, Disasters Fade – Most Auspicious**\n\nVirtue aids the good affinity,\nHeaven’s decree descends in splendor’s canopy.\nMany woes and trials’ weight,\nSwept away, no faults remain of late.\n\nThree disasters, eight hardships—self-made woes bring no reprieve;\nFour pillars, five phases—knowing fate’s bounds, none may deceive.\nHarm dispelled, blessings arrive like sun melting ice;\nFaults scattered, fortune blooms like leaves in storm’s device.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – Awaiting Time’s Blessing – Middling**\n\nJade lies hidden in Kunlun’s height,\nIts radiance chills the Dipper’s light.\nIf met by a master’s discerning hand,\nIts treasure passed through the land.\n\nVirtue hidden like jade in stone’s embrace;\nFate’s favor like an immortal freed from mortal’s case.\nVirtue and benevolence—man’s true treasure, sage or wise;\nGold, jade, pearls—worldly wealth, rich or noble’s prize.\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Chen – First Union, Then Parting – Most Inauspicious**\n\nAsh cools in the brazier’s cold,\nThe goblet drained, joy grows old.\nMany words of laughter shared,\nAll now like a dream’s snare.\n\nThe brazier’s embers fade to gray;\nThe cup stands empty, mirth decayed.\nSo many words of joy once spoken,\nAll now as if in dreams awoken.",

snow,\nFleeting blossoms cannot endure spring.\nHold fast to truth and preserve integrity—\nUnyielding resolve ensures peace.\n\nTo guard truth and the Dao is like pines and cypresses standing proud

lie ahead.\nGuard the heart, and affairs are guarded;\nIn joy and laughter, do not cling or chase.\n\nSeeking friends and companions requires no toil of crossing waters or climbing peaks;\nCultivating nature and refining the true begins with cutting off greed and severing desire.\nThe heart should ever be guarded—guarded, then no loss, no sorrow;\nThe mind should cast off excess—excess cast off, then neither obstinate nor overbearing.\n\n---\n\n**Second Oracle of the Hour of You – A Path to Advance – Moderate**\n\nA trail is not blocked,\nNo gate cannot be closed.\nNot acting recklessly for others,\nYet affairs must still be tended with care.\n\nA winding path, unless it twists and turns, cannot be traversed;\nA roundabout pursuit, without circling and maneuvering, cannot be achieved.\nAffairs may take two or three attempts before success—do not shrink from the trouble;\nThe mind advances and retreats with due consideration—this is no reckless act.\n\n---\n\n**Third Oracle of the Hour of You – Defying Reason Brings Regret – Most Inauspicious**\n\nManaging wealth and affairs lags,\nGhosts and thieves see their chance.\nDo not share matters of one heart,\nBeware of words that twist right and wrong.\n\nManaging wealth and affairs—wealth brings no profit, affairs no success;\nHandling lawsuits and marriages—lawsuits suffer loss, marriages break.\nMoreover, ghosts and thieves press with hidden schemes;\nBeware of words turning to deceit, becoming crooked wrongs.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of You – Beware of Petty Men – Most Inauspicious**\n\nHis intent harbors harm,\nThis heart remains unaware.\nBeware still at the feast,\nLest outside affairs entangle you.\n\nHe nurses harm toward me—his words are gentle, his face respectful;\nI remain heedless—my actions unguarded, my seat unobservant.\nBeware of joy in cups turning to enmity,\nGuard against presumption, fearing entanglements.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of You – Losing Control Brings Misfortune – Most Inauspicious**\n\nJade and stone cannot be smelted,\nCinnabar cannot be sunk.\nIf not used where they belong,\nEven treasures lose their true worth.\n\nJade and stone, most fine, cannot endure fire or boiling water;\nThe heart, though most clear, cannot be without caution or care.\nLosing control, the swift steed bolts—near or far, hard to retrieve;\nIndulging recklessness, the lost stray—stumbling, perilous to return.\n\n---\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of You – Abandon Gain, Avoid Harm – Moderate**\n\nOld matters should not be raised,\nRaising them brings entanglement.\nCast them aside for now,\nAnd your descendants will inherit the family legacy.\n\nPast affairs must not be revived—reviving them brings harm upon oneself;\nThe honey on a blade’s edge must not be tasted—tasting it surely wounds the tongue.\nAbandon small gains, and great affairs will surely succeed;\nProfit the subordinates, and the superior’s favor will surely follow.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of You – Stillness Guards the Heart – Moderate**\n\nBeyond the heavens, the moon’s brilliance is clear,\nAmid the clouds, a crow cries.\nIn stillness, not a single affair stirs,\nDo not let private desires arise.\n\nStill the heart—the six thieves do not stir, the five aggregates are empty;\nGuard the heart—a hundred demons vanish of themselves, the three poisons fade.\nThough wolves and tigers are fierce beasts, they too can be captured and subdued;\nGood and evil arise from the heart—it is there they must be mastered.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of You – Light Trust, Few Promises – Most Inauspicious**\n\nA thousand past promises,\nLabor in vain through endless turns.\nThough smiling assent is given before your face,\nThe heart harbors many other schemes.\n\nMatters entreated and sought may be most earnest and diligent,\nYet words promised and pledged are often false and deceitful.\nHumble words and lavish gifts waste only spirit and strength;\nFlattering smiles and meandering talk are but their cunning disguises.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Toil, First Success – Moderate**\n\nTwo are of one matter,\nYet both hearts push and vie.\nRat and Ox press urgently,\nTiger and Hare meet with joy.\n\nTwo of one heart—righteousness may divide gold;\nTwo of differing minds—affairs find no cooperation.\nRat and Ox in use bring toiling labor of the heart;\nTiger and Hare in harmony bear the glad countenance of joy.\n\n---\n\n**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of You – First Examine, Then Act – Moderate**\n\nEach step guards against danger,\nBoarding a boat, prepare for wind.\nHow can one rush to decide?\nNo need to ask of success or failure.\n\nMatters great or small should be pondered thrice before acting;\nMovement, whether auspicious or ill, must be carefully weighed before use.\nHastening on foot, one still guards against stumbling peril;\nSeeking profit or fame—how can one rush to judgment?\n\n---\n\n**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of You – Doubtful Matters, Do Not Act – Moderate**\n\nThe obscure cannot be known,\nSeeking fame, knock at the sage’s gate.\nOne should weigh and discern,\nDoubtful matters need not be pursued.\n\nObscurity is the sign of the unknowable—none can fathom it;\nDoubt is the beginning of confusion—spirits cannot clarify it.\nWeigh and abandon—do not act, for acting brings discord;\nWait for the time, and it will naturally open—opening, it may endure.\n\n---\n\n**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of You – Resentment Dissolves, Grudges Release – Moderate**\n\nLong-held suspicions,\nNow resentment fades, grievances cease.\nNo need for excessive caution,\nMeet with courtesy and harmony.\n\nSmall grudges unremoved breed great resentment;\nSmall resentments unresolved lead to great strife.\nSuspicious thoughts cannot be eased without self-release;\nContentious beginnings cannot be reconciled without forbearance.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Encountering Affairs, Seek Favor – Moderate**\n\nIn a secluded chamber, sorrow lingers,\nLife on water—a fleeting bubble.\nMeeting spring, one must seize the chance,\nDo not stubbornly delay.\n\nLife in the world is like a bubble on water;\nPlans unfulfilled are like confinement in a dim room.\nMeeting the spring of opportunity, one may yet unfold long-stifled aspirations;\nFortunate to find a favorable turn, do not insist on lingering.\n\n---\n\n**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Haste Desires Slow Progress – Moderate**\n\nHeard but not seen,\nWhether met or not remains unknown.\nDesiring advance, yet unable to move,\nLeave it to the will of others.\n\nRumors from a thousand miles are often false, rarely true;\nWhether one meets or not at this moment is hard to trust, hard to know.\nAffairs may yet be achieved, but not yet achieved;\nThe heart may desire speed, but speed is not yet attainable.\n\n---\n\n**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of You – Promotion and Emolument May Rise – Most Auspicious**\n\nHeaven and Earth bestow vast favor,\nHuman and spirit alike revere and admire.\nRadiance gathers where virtue dwells,\nLook up—blessings arrive.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s grace is abundant—assisting the virtuous, aiding the powerful;\nHuman and spirit revere—unashamed above, unabashed below.\nEmolument and rank advance, celebrating layer upon layer of joy;\nOfficial ranks shift and turn, bowing in admiration to wave upon wave of glory.",

      "translated_text": "**First Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Wasted Effort – Most Inauspicious**\n\nDesires of reckless pursuit are like seeking fish from a green tree;\nSchemes beyond one’s station differ not from drilling ice for fire.\nOne must turn inward and reflect in silence—now awakened, while before deluded.\nIt is fitting to examine awakened thoughts with care—for the sober are clear, while the drunk remain muddled.\n\n---\n\n**Second Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Broken Tripod – Most Inauspicious**\n\nWhat use is a tripod with broken legs?\nAll arrangements will surely meet peril.\nMocked by the chatter of inferiors,\nIncapable of accomplishing a single task.\n\nA tripod with broken legs cannot stand—once upright, it tilts and topples.\nAffairs that defy principle cannot proceed—once attempted, they falter and stall.\nTilting brings danger and instability, estranging the favor of superiors;\nStalling brings frustration and unrest, inciting the clamor of subordinates.\n\n---\n\n**Third Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Salvation in Distress – Most Auspicious**\n\nA withered tree at last finds use,\nThough frost and snow have battered it.\nOne morning, touched by spring’s delight,\nIt suddenly bursts into fragrant bloom.\n\nAmidst piled snow and bitter frost, leaves fall and forests wither;\nIn times of hardship and misfortune, the heart grows weary and the will slackens.\nFortunately, the warm breath of spring revives all things—woods flourish and trees thrive;\nWith the aid of a guiding hand, distress dissolves and calamity is resolved.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Borrowing Strength – Most Auspicious**\n\nA rut blocks the cart’s path,\nAnd the journey ahead seems delayed.\nSuddenly, another lends their strength—\nA single step ascends the cloud ladder.\n\nA boulder obstructing the rut—even Meng Ben could not drag the cart forward;\nA fierce tiger in the way—even Bian Zhuang would not dare advance.\nYet when others remove the stone, the wheels roll with thunderous force;\nWhen the divine shields one’s path, even tigers pose no cause for fear.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Plans Come to Naught – Most Inauspicious**\n\nDreams shatter, the spirit fades,\nAnd sorrow rises in the stillness.\nSo many fine schemes devised,\nYet wind and rain howl on, desolate.\n\nThe spirit fades as dreams dissolve—hundreds of plans come to nothing;\nThoughts scatter, the mind wanders—not a single strategy bears fruit.\nFacing the desolate night rain, sorrow stirs in solitude;\nIn the hush of the sighing west wind, regret deepens in silence.\n\n---\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Caution and Restraint – Neutral**\n\nDanger dispelled beyond the towering peaks,\nYet jackals and wolves prowl daily.\nFor now, tread low and winding paths—\nDo not yet unfurrow your troubled brow.\n\nDwelling in deep valleys and perilous mountains, every step is fraught with danger;\nLiving among jackals and tigers, one must remain vigilant day and night.\nIt is wise to be cautious and guarded—only then can peril give way to safety;\nOne must ever be humble and patient—thus may constant worry turn to fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Stillness and Timing – Neutral**\n\nAll sounds now hushed, the world serene,\nThe moon’s radiance shines bright and clear.\nIndulge in poetry and wine for joy—\nLet all else fade from concern.\n\nAll sounds stilled, the moon’s glow illumines a pristine universe;\nAll worries dissolved, the spirit at rest, the body feels light.\nWhy not freely pursue delight in poetry and wine, roaming beyond the mundane?\nGuard your true nature—what hinders singing of the joy within?\n\n---\n\n**Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Guard Against Deceit – Most Inauspicious**\n\nThree women demand vigilance,\nTheir cunning words disrupt all order.\nGuard your heart, do not indulge—\nOx and horse may yet avert disaster.\n\nThe deceiver’s wiles are unfathomable, their depths unknowable;\nFalse words confound truth—surely they are deceitful, surely they are treacherous.\nThose who flatter must not be lightly trusted—trust leads to error;\nThose who please must be carefully guarded—vigilance averts harm.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Accumulating Merit to Attain the Dao – Most Auspicious**\n\nThe elixir of nine refinements,\nIts power perfected not in a single moment.\nTo seek the supreme Dao,\nFirst devote yourself to selfless action.\n\nWithout accumulated merit, the Dao cannot be attained;\nOnly through repeated refinement can the elixir be achieved.\nCultivating practice over lifetimes, one’s name is inscribed in golden registers and jade tablets;\nPursuing study through the years, the body ascends to the azure clouds and purple mists.\n\n---\n\n**Tenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Escaping Peril to Joy – Most Auspicious**\n\nThe worthy and enlightened are true scholars,\nLike fish that slip free from the hook.\nLeaping through waves a thousand feet high,\nA single bait cannot hold them.\n\nThe worthy and enlightened do not fall prey to petty gains that harm the self;\nHow can a fish in a valley stream be ensnared by a single bait?\nThe golden-scaled fish escapes the hook, leaping in the mighty waves;\nThe noble one emerges from calamity, swiftly advancing on the path of prosperity.\n\n---\n\n**Eleventh Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Uprightness Brings Blessing – Most Auspicious**\n\nVast and boundless, the heavens and earth,\nMajestic and revered, virtue and power.\nTo conduct oneself with integrity—\nFortune and favor reside within the heart.\n\nHeaven and earth are vast—good and evil meet their just reward without partiality;\nVirtue and power are lofty—uprightness and perversity are revealed through cultivation.\nWith a heart and thoughts aligned in rectitude, blessings naturally descend;\nWith a heart and thoughts steeped in perversity, good fortune naturally recedes.\n\n---\n\n**Twelfth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Caution Against Extravagance – Neutral**\n\nHow can shallow waters stir great waves?\nA meager capacity must guard against excess.\nFrom this moment, practice restraint—\nThus may coming misfortune be worn away.\n\nA mere puddle—how can it generate waves?\nA narrow-minded person—how can their heart hold generosity?\nGood fortune arises from diligence and frugality—frugality brings abundance;\nCalamity stems from indulgence and extravagance—extravagance leads to ruin.\n\n---\n\n**Thirteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Upholding the Dao Without Force – Neutral**\n\nHow long can fleeting splendor last?\nTurn back—do not let time slip idly by.\nGuard your enterprise, do not neglect it;\nRestrain the reckless heart, let it know no waves.\n\nFleeting splendor passes like a dream in the southern branch;\nGrand affairs are rare—time drifts, and the years change.\nDo not let the Dao’s work lapse—turn inward and reflect;\nCalm the mind, beware of idleness—few worries bring no misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Fourteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Discord in Affairs – Most Inauspicious**\n\nWater and fire cannot coexist,\nAs the mechanisms of petty men and noble ones differ.\nThey cannot share joy in harmony—\nParting or staying will surely prove difficult.\n\nIce and charcoal cannot share a furnace—they are bound by mutual generation and restraint;\nFragrance and stench cannot ride the same carriage—they are bound by mutual contamination and defilement.\nThe noble one possesses a heart of compassion and mercy;\nThe petty man lacks foresight and lofty vision.\n\n---\n\n**Fifteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Lost Yet Found – Most Auspicious**\n\nRushing forward, the path is lost at the fork,\nThe heart heavy with sorrow.\nThen, a celestial melody rings clear—\nOnly now does the radiance appear.\n\nWhen the mind is lost, one stumbles at the crossroads;\nWhen the spirit is distraught, actions become erratic.\nIn peril, a kind soul offers enlightenment—words of wisdom like celestial music;\nIn adversity, a noble person lends aid—once more, the light of day is seen.\n\n---\n\n**Sixteenth Oracle of

      "translated_text": "**Sixteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Wealth Piled Like Mountains – Most Inauspicious**\n\nA mountain of treasures stands before you,\nYet the traveler departs empty-handed.\nWisdom and skill are but vain exertions—\nA fleeting laugh between dream and soul.\n\nOne who fails to accumulate goodness enters the treasure mountain and leaves with empty hands;\nThe Dao is scarce in affinity—even if one meets a true immortal, there are no eyes to recognize them.\nOpportunity arrives, yet through hesitation and misjudgment, all schemes and strategies come to naught;\nGood fortune presents itself, yet through discord and misstep, all plans and efforts prove useless.\n\n---\n\n**Seventeenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Troubles Unresolved – Most Inauspicious**\n\nRiding a tiger, dismounting is perilous—\nOne must follow the moment, circling endlessly.\nYet should the day come when freedom is won,\nHow joyous the fulfillment of my lifelong resolve!\n\nAscending a perilous cliff, the heart must not grow careless—carelessness brings harm to oneself;\nRiding a fierce beast, one cannot dismount—dismounting invites devouring.\nIn this time of worry, it is best to remain humble and reverent, awaiting the turn of events;\nOnly when one attains liberation may one truly know the ease of casting aside concerns and wandering freely.\n\n---\n\n**Eighteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Affairs Hindered – Most Inauspicious**\n\nThin mist gathers into dense gloom,\nThe sky darkens, and clarity eludes.\nThe traveler sighs in vain—\nThe road ahead remains long.\n\nThick gloom obscures the sky, leaving no distinction between dusk and dawn;\nSetting forth empty-handed, one suddenly falls into a mire of confusion.\nPlans unfulfilled, the journey ahead is fraught with obstacles—water divides villages, and mist veils the paths;\nPeople remain obstructed, and even more so when awakening is hindered—clouds shroud the fields and trails.\n\n---\n\n**Nineteenth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Reunion After Parting – Most Auspicious**\n\nYears have passed since we last parted,\nOur reunion now a chance encounter.\nOnce more, the feast is laid, and cups are raised—\nLaughter and joy intertwine anew.\n\nAn old friend, cherished in parting, is met again with the joy of shared cups and plates;\nThe precious moon, though once waning, holds the promise of reunion.\nMatters of fate are as easily turned as the palm—smiles bloom, and faces brighten;\nTimes of prosperity and peace are like a wheel rolling forward—joy descends as if from heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Twentieth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Persistence in Affairs – Neutral**\n\nThree visits are needed before the meeting,\nA single word will not suffice to turn away.\nOnly after repeated efforts\nDoes the smile of success appear.\n\nKnocking at the gate thrice, one does not shirk the toil of coming and going;\nIf matters could be settled with a single word, how could there be no room for consent?\nThough persistence may require repeated attempts, sincerity will ultimately bear fruit;\nBy steadfastly holding to one course with diligence, no task will remain unaccomplished.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-First Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Tidings of Joy – Most Auspicious**\n\nA flock of crows flies through the clouds—\nOnly now is the message known.\nSeated, one awaits the return of the reply,\nAnd the traveler is but a short distance away.\n\nA wild goose’s foot bears a letter—joy comes with the beautiful tidings from the clouds;\nA fish’s belly carries a

accord.\nTransgressions and offenses are absolved,\nAnd favor, rank, and fortune are bestowed anew.\n\nAn amnesty descends from heaven, releasing faults and pardoning errors;\nFortune flows from the true Dao, preserving life and extending destiny.\nThe gates of darkness are broken, and one is elevated beyond the common;\nThe light of grace shines upon them, and their name is inscribed with rank

it cannot be discerned.\nMeeting a true friend, one’s talents may be revealed and their person elevated;\nEncountering a lofty sage, one’s Dao may be illuminated and made clear.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – False Words and Empty Trust – Most Inauspicious**\n\nFalse words and idle speech abound,\nVain and devoid of truth.\nRumors spread, yet

transmitter inverts right and wrong, misleading the ears of the multitude.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Seizing the Moment – Neutral**\n\nA hundred blossoms bloom in fragrant splendor,\nThe spring flowers in full, resplendent display.\nThe Lord of Spring bestows his touch—\nWhy fear delay in affairs?\n\nPlants that do not meet spring cannot sprout or bloom;\nPeople who do

things, a time of fragrant flowers and swaying willows.\nWith the world before one’s eyes radiant and clear, why not laugh and wander freely?\nWhen the weight of worry is suddenly lifted, what hinders joyful roaming?\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Seventh Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Attaining Rank and Emolument – Most Auspicious**\n\nDust is swept away without a trace,\nRobes and cap, learning and conduct—all made new.\nOnly then can the great Dao be attained,\nAnd the blue clouds will not be betrayed.\n\nThe sacred terrace is swept clean, not a speck of dust remains;\nLearning surpasses all others, and one is certain to claim the highest honors.\nRobes and cap command respect and reverence;\nAchievements are fulfilled, and one attains the supreme glory of the imperial examinations.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Eighth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Incompatibility – Most Inauspicious**\n\nDo not attempt to carve unyielding stone,\nNor plant a withered willow.\nThe petty lack great capacity—\nWhat is past cannot be undone.\n\nOne of small capacity cannot bear great responsibility;\nOne of low wisdom cannot discourse on lofty matters.\nUnyielding stone cannot be carved into jade—efforts are wasted;\nWithered wood cannot take root—watering and tending are in vain.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Worries Dissipate – Neutral**\n\nEndless worries linger,\nYet no trace or cause is seen.\nOne must await the turning of the seasons—\nAnxieties will flow away like water.\n\nProlonged indecision is called worry;\nFear of impending misfortune is called anxiety.\nWorries dissolve like clouds scattered by a violent wind;\nAnxieties vanish like waves carried away by the current.\n\n---\n\n**Thirtieth Oracle of the Hour of Xu – Ghostly Worries and Anxieties – Most Inauspicious**\n\nNight rain weeps at the secluded window,\nWind and cold, the rain lashes fiercely.\nSleep eludes, and one cannot rest—\nOther sorrows weigh even heavier.\n\nAt the secluded window, ghosts weep—malevolent spirits invade the household;\nThrough the long night, wind and cold—illness and misfortune cling to the young and weak.\nWhen affairs are in disarray,

Inauspicious**\n\nWithout study, the Dao remains unknown;\nWithout cultivation, truth is not met.\nNot a trace of effort—\nOnly an empty name in vain.\n\nMerit and cultivation complete, one may ascend the Dao and attain immortality;\nLearning and conduct refined, how could official rank and glory be absent?\nYet with neither virtue nor learning cultivated,\nHopes for wealth, honor, and fame are far off indeed.\n\n---\n\n**Sixth Oracle of the Hour of Hai – Clarity Emerges from Obscurity – Most Auspicious**\n\nAn ancient mirror, long dimmed,\nIts radiance unheard of.\nOnce polished by another’s

sincerity, one answers heaven and earth—\nTake care not to create new transgressions.\n\nMalevolent spirits scatter, driven away by the power of the Dao;\nIllness fades from the secluded chamber, shielded by true light.\nReverent and devout in offerings and good deeds,\nExpiate misfortunes, give thanks—\nAvoid wrongdoing, forsake all evil.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth Oracle of the Hour of Hai – Minor Troubles Unsettled – Most Inauspicious**\n\nThe moon wanes, not yet full,\nA lone figure shuts the door.\nUnable to straighten what is bent,\nThe young and weak fear peril.\n\nThe moon’s light
