  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Qīng Tiān Gē* (The Song of the Azure Sky)**\n\n**Title:** *Qīng Tiān Gē Zhūshì* (Commentary on the *Song of the Azure Sky*), also known as *Zhǐ Chángchūn Qīng Tiān Gē Zhūshì* (Commentary on the *Song of the Azure Sky* by the Master of Eternal Spring).\n**Author:** Yuan Wang Jie’s annotation.\n**Volume:** One scroll.\n**Source:** *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), *Dòngzhēn Bù* (Section on the Mystic Truth), *Yùjué Lèi* (Category of Jade Precepts).\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Qīng Tiān Gē* by the Obscure Sage (Hùnrán Zǐ):**\n\nDo not let floating clouds obstruct the Azure Sky,\nFor the **Dao/Way** is naturally without action.\nWhen clouds arise, they veil the Azure Sky and all phenomena,\nYet all that is *with action* is but an illusion.\n\nThe \"Azure Sky\" refers to **human nature** itself.\nThe \"floating clouds\" symbolize the **human’s杂念 (zániàn, miscellaneous thoughts)**.\nThese two lines serve as a fundamental outline for those who cultivate the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIn general, throughout the day and night,\nThe mind must remain pure and unadulterated,\nThe intention must be **湛然 (zhànrán, clear and profound)**,\nNever stirring a single hair’s worth of private thought—\nFor if true nature is left undisturbed,\nIt will naturally shine forth, like the Azure Sky unobstructed by clouds.\nYet if the mind is enslaved by its desires,\nAnd when confronted with sights or sounds,\nIt drifts along with its thoughts,\nThen its deviations grow ever more distant—\nThis is like the clouds arising and veiling all phenomena.\n\nWhen all phenomena stand in orderly array and subdue the hundred evils,\nNature is tranquil, emotions at ease.\nBut if the radiant light fails to dispel darkness,\nAnd the mind grows restless, the spirit weary,\nThen it is said that **one nature** holds its rightful place,\nAnd the hundred evils naturally retreat—\nThus, the body becomes a realm of **天地 (Tiān-Dì, Heaven and Earth)**,\nAnd **万气 (wàngì, the myriad qi)** merge into **一气 (yīqì, singular qi)**,\nAs do **万神 (wàngān, the myriad spirits)** into **一神 (yīshén, singular spirit)**.\n\nWhen the mind is naturally stable and sovereign,\nIt subdues the hundred evils.\nYet if anger cannot be restrained,\nDesire cannot be curbed,\nAnd one indulges in unrestrained emotions,\nThen darkness is ensnared—\nThis is when my radiant light fails to dispel the shadows,\nAnd the evil **魔 (mó, demons)** flourish.\n\nAt first, I opened the **廓 (kuò, void)** of Heaven and Earth, pure and clear,\nMastering myself and returning to propriety,\nSinging of the peace of ten thousand households and a thousand gates—\nThe world submits to **仁 (rén, benevolence)**.\nThis speaks of those who attain the **Dao/Way**,\nPiercing through the illusory nature of the birth-body,\nRevealing its true emptiness—\nOnly this pristine stillness remains,\nEver like a babe in arms,\nNature itself is void, yet life is firm—\nThen throughout the body, the **四大 (sìdà, Four Great Elements)** and **八万四千毫孔 (bāwàn-sìqiān-háokǒng, eighty-four thousand hair-like pores)**,\nThe blood and **气 (qi)** flow unimpeded,\nAnd all passages are unobstructed.\n\nThe *I Ching* (Book of Changes) states in the *Kūn* (Earth) Hexagram:\n*\"The yellow center harmonizes with principle,\nThe upright position fills the body,\nIts flow extends to the four limbs,\nAnd beauty resides within.\"*\n\nIs this not the same as Heaven and Earth being pure,\nAnd all households at peace?\n\nSometimes a single dark cloud arises,\nAnger cannot be restrained, desire cannot be curbed—\nThen the nine orifices and hundred bones are all restless,\nAnd **水火 (shuǐhuǒ, water and fire)** fail to balance.\n\nThis speaks of when a person’s evil thoughts are stirred—\nLike a dark cloud rising.\nAt such times, one must urgently **知觉 (zhījué, awaken to awareness)**,\nQuickly **回光返照 (huíguāng-fǎnzhào, reflect the light inward)**,\nAnd cultivate the **良心 (liángxīn, true/innate mind)**.\n\nIf there is no restraint,\nAnd one lets the **眼耳鼻舌 (yǎn-ěr-bí-shé, eyes, ears, nose, and tongue)**—the four gates—\nLeak in and be enslaved by form,\nThen the **性天 (xìngtiān, innate nature)** is sealed by dark clouds,\nAnd the **苦海 (kǔhǎi, sea of suffering)** churns with waves of **淫欲 (yínyù, licentious desire)**—\nThus, the nine orifices and hundred bones are all restless.\n\nThe *Dàodé Jīng* (Classic of the Dao/Way) says:\n*\"Open its gates,\nBalance its affairs,\nAnd it will not fail throughout life.\"*\n\nThe Zen masters say:\n*\"One need not fear the arising of evil thoughts,\nOnly fear the tardiness of awareness.\"*\n\nMencius also states:\n*\"To lose one’s chicken and dog and yet know how to seek them is not so bad,\nBut to lose one’s mind and yet not know how to seek it—ah, this is lamentable!\"*\n\nStudents of the **Dao/Way** should not neglect this warning.\n\nThus, the **长教 (Chángjiào, Master of Eternal Teaching)** exhorts:\nLet the **慧风 (huìfēng, wind of wisdom)** blow fiercely,\nAnd the **神 (shén, spirit)**—once released—will swiftly return.\n\nThe Three Realms and Ten Directions drift and clear away—\nWash the heart, purify the thoughts.\n\nThis passage warns the student:\nThe heart must always dwell within the chest,\nIn motion or stillness, maintaining purity—\nDo not oppose it to the myriad entanglements.\n\nWhen encountering all forms and phenomena,\nOne must resolutely sever attachment—\nGuard against stirring the mind.\n\nThe True Person Yín Xǐ says:\n*\"When all things come,\nI respond with my nature,\nNot with my mind.\"*\n\nThe *Vajra Sutra* also states:\n*\"Do not dwell on form and give rise to mind,\nDo not dwell on sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma and give rise to mind.\nInstead, give rise to mind without dwelling—\nThus, the mind is subdued.\"*\n\nConfucius once said:\n*\"The gentleman cultivates his station and acts accordingly,\nNot desiring what lies beyond it.\"*\n\nThus, he teaches:\nIf the heart’s sovereign can maintain its rectitude,\nWisdom naturally becomes boundless—\nThen the Three Treasures return to the body,\nThe Ten Directions grow serene,\nAnd no obstruction remains.\n\nClouds disperse, revealing the true form of emptiness—\nOne True Nature eternally abides.\nNaturally, the moon shines in every home.\nThe entire body is the Dao/Way.\n\nThis follows the earlier teaching:\nHaving attained clarity across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,\nWith no thought arising,\nThe true nature eternally remains—\nIts wonder manifests throughout the body,\nStars and moon radiate light—\nThis is the Dao/Way of inner vision and forgetting.\n\nAs the *Sutra on Delivering Beings* says:\n*\"All celestial orders return to their proper places.\"*\nJust as Yán Zǐ’s repeated emptiness demonstrates.\n\nBeneath the moon’s light, now take your flute and blow—\nAt the hour of *guǐ*’s birth, act swiftly to gather.\n\nA single resonant note shakes both Hua and Yi.\nThe returning wind blends as one.\n\n**Hereafter, the alchemy of cultivating life begins.**\nThe moon below refers to the body’s Winter Solstice,\nWhen the hour of *zi* stirs—one *yang*’s first motion,\nThe moment *guǐ* is born.\nAt this time, act swiftly to harvest it—\nCall forth the spirit to draw the *qi*,\nLet the *qi* return to its orifices,\nInternally sound its tone, externally seal its gate,\nHarmonizing the *lǜ* and blending the hundred spirits.\nThis is blowing the flute of your body’s unpierced pipe,\nEmitting a resonant note that vibrates Hua and Yi.\nWithout a true master, the oral instruction remains unknown.\n\nAwaken the Jade Boy of the East—\nDescend to the Water Palace to seek the Mysterious.\nRide the white deer backward, swift as stars.\n\n**Take from the Abyss to fill the Fire.**\nAwaken—this is fumigation, rising from below.\nThe East refers to *jiǎ* wood generating fire in the *yín* position.\nThe Jade Boy is the flowing intention, the flying spirit.\nBackward riding is inversion.\nThe white deer is refined essence transformed into white *fèi*.\nIn summary, whenever entering the chamber to forge the elixir,\nLet the sovereign nature flow internally, sink downward to the Water Palace for steaming,\nPreserve the middle root, await the gradual intensification of *yang* fire,\nThen move and ascend through the head’s pass—\nFrom *yín* to *jǐ*, flowing *wù* earth,\nAdvancing *yang* fire along the *dū* meridian,\nDriving the metal essence upward,\nPiercing the Three Passes, ascending to the Southern Palace,\nSupplementing the *yīn* within the Fire—\nThus completing the *qián* symbol—\nSwift as stars in flight.\n\n**Dally not, but turn with ease—**\nExit has form, entry has none.\nNot the *shēng*, nor the *jué*.\n\nThe Formless Form.\n\nDallying is to block the gradual—\nFrom above descending below.\nThe ease of turning is this:\nWhen the Six Yang converge with *Qián*,\nThe principle that *yang* has no ultimate end—\nOne *yín* arises beneath the Five Yang,\nAnd from here onward, one must block the gradual.\n\nFrom *wǔ* to *hài*,\nUsing *jǐ* earth to retreat the *yín* symbol,\nDescending through the *jīn* gate, crossing the Magpie Bridge at *Huá Chí*,\nBroad and unrestrained,\nEntering the layered towers of the Crimson Palace,\nStraightforward to the *Kūn* Palace’s earthen cauldron—\nAnd there it halts.\n\nA pearl is born, round as the moon—\nNot the *shēng*, nor the *jué*.\n\nThe three-foot *yún* bow with twelve strings,\nThe three flowers gathered in the tripod.\nThrough the ages, the *Hùnyuán* chisel.\nThe Five *qi* pay homage to the Primordial.\n\nThis continues the thought of *bié zhuǎn yī bān lè*—\nThus the three-foot *yún* bow:\nThe three great elixirs return to the tripod,\nMystically merging to condense the True,\nEach breath reclaiming a year’s twelve months of transformation.\nAs the *Dān Jīng* says:\n*\"Cluster years to return to months,\nCluster months to return to days,\nCluster days to return to hours—\nWithin one hour, only two *hòu* are used,\nRunning the *Zhòutian* cycle with the *fǔ* fire,\nHarvesting the elixir to enter the chamber,\nTo perform the inner work,\nFusing and tempering to form the Sacred Embryo—\nThus is the *Hùnyuán* chisel through the ages.\"*\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* states:\n*\"Central harmony of the Five *qi*,\nMingling with the hundred spirits,\nTen revolutions return the soul,\nTen thousand *qi* become immortals.\"*\n\nThus the *Liáo Zhēn Zǐ* says:\n*\"The great elixir’s threefold essence, *qi*, and spirit—\nHeaven’s child and parent mutually embrace.\nThe wind returns, mingling to restore the True Body,\nDaily refining—ever anew.\"*\n\nThe jade resonance, clear and resonant, surpasses *Zhèng* music.\nThe heavens are free of floating veils.\nLight and pure, it permeates the enlightened heart.\nThe Four *qì* are bright and clear.\n\nThis continues the meaning of the *Hùnyuán* chisel—\nThus the jade resonance, clear and resonant:\nThe true fire’s refining work is achieved,\nStripped of old defilements,\nAttaining harmony of spirit and *qi*,\nLike *Shùn Shāo*’s pure harmony,\nCutting off the licentious *Zhèng* sounds,\nAwakening to jade within my body—\nNo other hue remains,\nNaturally permeating, reaching the heart.\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* says:\n*\"The golden true resounds, flowing through the cloudy encampment,\nThe jade sound gathers *qi*, the spirit wind gathers mist—\nThis is only for those with true transmission and practiced work.\nHow could they know such marvels?\"*\n\nFrom one attainment, ghosts and spirits assist,\nNo demon dares to interfere.\nAscending earth, transcending heaven beyond ancient and modern.\nTransformation follows me.\n\nThis speaks of the Dao’s perfection—\nChange and transformation at will,\nThe universe within me, all transformations in my body.\nAt this station, *yín* and *yang* follow my command,\nThe Five Phases are my tools,\nWind and rain are my summons,\nThunder and lightning are my calls.\nThus manifesting the Great Body,\nPermeating every dust mote,\nHiding the Small Body,\nBearing *Móu Mí*.\n\nGhosts and spirits cannot fathom my scheme,\nNaturally bound to guard me—\nEntering earth, ascending heaven,\nTranscending past and future, all within me,\nLimitless transformation.\n\nUnbounded freedom, no constraints,\nNot enslaved by form.\nThe heart does not covet honor, the body knows no shame.\nInner and outer both forgotten.\n\nThis continues the thought of transcending past and future—\nThus unbounded freedom:\nThe Dao alone is my body,\nNot swayed by the world’s changes,\nInverted and wielded with ease,\nTransformation follows me—\nHow could there be constraints?\nWealth, honor, and glory—\nAt this point, all are overturned.\nWould my heart still covet honor, my body know shame?\n\nThis path of life—\nIf not a resolute man of decisive courage,\nHow could one attain this?\n\nLeisurely singing the *White Snow* song from the *hú*,\nThe Dao is the Great Void.\nQuietly tuning the *Yang Chun* melody of the world beyond,\nTranscending the Three Realms.\n\nThis speaks of leisurely singing—\nSelf-attained true joy.\nMy body has another *hú* heaven’s scenery,\nEver flying white snow across the sky,\nClear and bright, not a speck of dust to enter.\nAs *Zhuāngzǐ* says:\n*\"The empty chamber births white, the spirit naturally arrives.\"*\nThe *Yín Zhēn Rén* also says:\n*\"In one breath, emotions dissolve—\nAnd one ascends to the Great Dao.\"*\n\nThus the Nine Harmonies and Ten Unifications,\nOne breath of pure *yang*—\nTranscending beyond the Three Realms.\nIs this not singing the *Yang Chun* melody?\n\nMy family’s melody is all natural,\nForm and spirit both wondrous.\nThe flute has no holes, the zither no strings.\nUniting with the True Dao.\n\nThis speaks of the nine-turn elixir’s perfection,\nDetaching the body, transforming the spirit—\nThe natural Dao, the body akin to emptiness,\nNot a form to be seen.\nThus the *Yuānshǐ Tiānzūn* says:\n*\"Seeing me is not seeing,\nHearing me is not hearing,\nAbandoning all boundaries—\nThis is called the Marvelous Dao.\"*\nHow could the flute truly have holes or the zither strings?\n\nThese messages can only be silently understood by the ancients—\nThe Dao is formless,\nI am not-I,\nIron walls, silver mountains—\nSuddenly pierced through.\n\nWhen the student here grasps a word,\nAll study is complete—\nWhat doubts remain?\n\nAwakening in surprise to the dream of mortal life,\nThe void dissolved into dust.\nDay and night, pure sounds fill the Celestial Cavern—\nOnly the golden true reveals itself.\n\nThis passage summarizes the marvel of the beginning and end—\nThe attained—\nAttaining the true Dao,\nForever certifying the indestructible golden body,\nAwakening to the illusory nature of all conditioned existence,\nLike a dream.\nThus today, ascending to the supreme marvelous Dao,\nWithin my body, night and day, the music of immortals resounds,\nFilling the Celestial Cavern.\n\nThis also warns later scholars:\nThough one may attain worldly fame or surpassing literature,\nWithout the true transmission of the Dao,\nIn the end, it is all empty and unreal.\nIf one only clings in delusion, lost in mortal dreams,\nEndless cycles of rebirth—\nHow could one escape birth and death?\n\nOnly a resolute man of decisive courage\nCan truly believe, penetrate, and sever.\nOne awakening glance—\nDirectly transcending the formless realm,\nTurning toward the Great Dao,\nInternally nurturing spirit and *qi*,\nExternally blending with the mundane and dust.\n\nThis is the Dao/Way of both dwelling in and transcending the world,\nInstantly riding alongside the immortals and Buddhas—\nHow could this be mere empty talk?\n\nThe *Celestial Cavern*’s song of commentary is now complete.",

      "translated_text": "The Formless Form.\n\nDallying is to block the gradual—\nFrom above descending below.\nThe ease of turning is this:\nWhen the Six Yang converge with *Qián*,\nThe principle that *yang* has no ultimate end—\nOne *yín* arises beneath the Five Yang,\nAnd from here onward, one must block the gradual.\n\nFrom *wǔ* to *hài*,\nUsing *jǐ* earth to retreat the *yín* symbol,\nDescending through the *jīn* gate, crossing the Magpie Bridge at *Huá Chí*,\nBroad and unrestrained,\nEntering the layered towers of the Crimson Palace,\nStraightforward to the *Kūn* Palace’s earthen cauldron—\nAnd there it halts.\n\nA pearl is born, round as the moon—\nNot the *shēng*, nor the *jué*.\n\nThe three-foot *yún* bow with twelve strings,\nThe three flowers gathered in the tripod.\nThrough the ages, the *Hùnyuán* chisel.\nThe Five *qi* pay homage to the Primordial.\n\nThis continues the thought of *bié zhuǎn yī bān lè*—\nThus the three-foot *yún* bow:\nThe three great elixirs return to the tripod,\nMystically merging to condense the True,\nEach breath reclaiming a year’s twelve months of transformation.\nAs the *Dān Jīng* says:\n*\"Cluster years to return to months,\nCluster months to return to days,\nCluster days to return to hours—\nWithin one hour, only two *hòu* are used,\nRunning the *Zhòutian* cycle with the *fǔ* fire,\nHarvesting the elixir to enter the chamber,\nTo perform the inner work,\nFusing and tempering to form the Sacred Embryo—\nThus is the *Hùnyuán* chisel through the ages.\"*\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* states:\n*\"Central harmony of the Five *qi*,\nMingling with the hundred spirits,\nTen revolutions return the soul,\nTen thousand *qi* become immortals.\"*\n\nThus the *Liáo Zhēn Zǐ* says:\n*\"The great elixir’s threefold essence, *qi*, and spirit—\nHeaven’s child and parent mutually embrace.\nThe wind returns, mingling to restore the True Body,\nDaily refining—ever anew.\"*\n\nThe jade resonance, clear and resonant, surpasses *Zhèng* music.\nThe heavens are free of floating veils.\nLight and pure, it permeates the enlightened heart.\nThe Four *qì* are bright and clear.\n\nThis continues the meaning of the *Hùnyuán* chisel—\nThus the jade resonance, clear and resonant:\nThe true fire’s refining work is achieved,\nStripped of old defilements,\nAttaining harmony of spirit and *qi*,\nLike *Shùn Shāo*’s pure harmony,\nCutting off the licentious *Zhèng* sounds,\nAwakening to jade within my body—\nNo other hue remains,\nNaturally permeating, reaching the heart.\n\nThe *Dù Rén Jīng* says:\n*\"The golden true resounds, flowing through the cloudy encampment,\nThe jade sound gathers *qi*, the spirit wind gathers mist—\nThis is only for those with true transmission and practiced work.\nHow could they know such marvels?\"*\n\nFrom one attainment, ghosts and spirits assist,\nNo demon dares to interfere.\nAscending earth, transcending heaven beyond ancient and modern.\nTransformation follows me.\n\nThis speaks of the Dao’s perfection—\nChange and transformation at will,\nThe universe within me, all transformations in my body.\nAt this station, *yín* and *yang* follow my command,\nThe Five Phases are my tools,\nWind and rain are my summons,\nThunder and lightning are my calls.\nThus manifesting the Great Body,\nPermeating every dust mote,\nHiding the Small Body,\nBearing *Móu Mí*.\n\nGhosts and spirits cannot fathom my scheme,\nNaturally bound to guard me—\nEntering earth, ascending heaven,\nTranscending past and future, all within me,\nLimitless transformation.\n\nUnbounded freedom, no constraints,\nNot enslaved by form.\nThe heart does not covet honor, the body knows no shame.\nInner and outer both forgotten.\n\nThis continues the thought of transcending past and future—\nThus unbounded freedom:\nThe Dao alone is my body,\nNot swayed by the world’s changes,\nInverted and wielded with ease,\nTransformation follows me—\nHow could there be constraints?\nWealth, honor, and glory—\nAt this point, all are overturned.\nWould my heart still covet honor, my body know shame?\n\nThis path of life—\nIf not a resolute man of decisive courage,\nHow could one attain this?\n\nLeisurely singing the *White Snow* song from the *hú*,\nThe Dao is the Great Void.\nQuietly tuning the *Yang Chun* melody of the world beyond,\nTranscending the Three Realms.\n\nThis speaks of leisurely singing—\nSelf-attained true joy.\nMy body has another *hú* heaven’s scenery,\nEver flying white snow across the sky,\nClear and bright, not a speck of dust to enter.\nAs *Zhuāngzǐ* says:\n*\"The empty chamber births white, the spirit naturally arrives.\"*\nThe *Yín Zhēn Rén* also says:\n*\"In one breath, emotions dissolve—\nAnd one ascends to the Great Dao.\"*\n\nThus the Nine Harmonies and Ten Unifications,\nOne breath of pure *yang*—\nTranscending beyond the Three Realms.\nIs this not singing the *Yang Chun* melody?\n\nMy family’s melody is all natural,\nForm and spirit both wondrous.\nThe flute has no holes, the zither no strings.\nUniting with the True Dao.\n\nThis speaks of the nine-turn elixir’s perfection,\nDetaching the body, transforming the spirit—\nThe natural Dao, the body akin to emptiness,\nNot a form to be seen.\nThus the *Yuānshǐ Tiānzūn* says:\n*\"Seeing me is not seeing,\nHearing me is not hearing,\nAbandoning all boundaries—\nThis is called the Marvelous Dao.\"*\nHow could the flute truly have holes or the zither strings?\n\nThese messages can only be silently understood by the ancients—\nThe Dao is formless,\nI am not-I,\nIron walls, silver mountains—\nSuddenly pierced through.\n\nWhen the student here grasps a word,\nAll study is complete—\nWhat doubts remain?\n\nAwakening in surprise to the dream of mortal life,\nThe void dissolved into dust.\nDay and night, pure sounds fill the Celestial Cavern—\nOnly the golden true reveals itself.\n\nThis passage summarizes the marvel of the beginning and end—\nThe attained—\nAttaining the true Dao,\nForever certifying the indestructible golden body,\nAwakening to the illusory nature of all conditioned existence,\nLike a dream.\nThus today, ascending to the supreme marvelous Dao,\nWithin my body, night and day, the music of immortals resounds,\nFilling the Celestial Cavern.\n\nThis also warns later scholars:\nThough one may attain worldly fame or surpassing literature,\nWithout the true transmission of the Dao,\nIn the end, it is all empty and unreal.\nIf one only clings in delusion, lost in mortal dreams,\nEndless cycles of rebirth—\nHow could one escape birth and death?\n\nOnly a resolute man of decisive courage\nCan truly believe, penetrate, and sever.\nOne awakening glance—\nDirectly transcending the formless realm,\nTurning toward the Great Dao,\nInternally nurturing spirit and *qi*,\nExternally blending with the mundane and dust.",
