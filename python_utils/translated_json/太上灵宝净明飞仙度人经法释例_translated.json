  "full_translation": "The *Exegetical Examples of the Highest Numinous Treasure’s Pure Clarity Flying Immortals Scripture of Salvation*, Expounded by the High and Illustrious Great Envoy, Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang\n\n**Chapter of Natural Jade Script**\n\nThe qi of the Great Brahmā originates from formlessness yet gives rise to form; it governs the innumerable yet directs the numbered. It emits the harmony of the natural, unfolds the subtlety of the natural, transcends the primordial chaos, and emerges beyond the realm of the imperceptible. Thereby, it discloses the hidden essence of Heaven and Earth, generates the pattern of the cosmos, regulates the movement of yin and yang, illumines the light of sun and moon, revolves the mechanism of the four seasons, engenders and restrains the qi of the Five Phases, nurtures central harmony to gestate sageliness, and radiates brilliance to compose culture.\n\nThe sage employs culture to transform, establishes teachings through sageliness, and thus emerges from the mysterious barrier, clarifying the Three Conveniences—all by regulating form and number to determine the cycles of destiny.\n\nThus, qi is the complete embodiment of the Dao. The effulgence of the Dao’s dispersion, its essence manifesting luminously, is like this.\n\nOf old, the Dragon Chart and Tortoise Script captured images and emulated patterns. The Yellow Emperor and Fuxi obtained them to succor the world, yet these were but remnants and dregs.\n\nTracing back to the sages of antiquity: they observed celestial patterns to discern temporal changes, surveyed mountain configurations to comprehend geography, and examined the markings of plants, birds, and beasts to devise appropriate measures. Thus, what is called *wen* (culture/pattern) is fundamentally the *wen* of the natural—it is not artificial. Those who grasp the *wen* of the natural can thereby penetrate the workings of creation, manifest form and number, and comprehend the great Dao of nature and destiny.\n\nCangjie devised characters from the tracks of birds, causing ghosts to weep and dragons to conceal themselves. Yet how far removed is this from the *wen* of the imperceptible natural, which descends to the world to deliver the multitudes!\n\nIf one can truly base oneself on this Dao to discern its principles, then though Heaven be high, one may ascend to its domain; though Earth be vast, one may traverse its regions. Though the sun and moon revolve without cease, one may ride their light; though the stars and constellations turn without constancy, one may tread their *gang*. Then, who can fathom even a fraction of the Great Brahmā?\n\nOur Dao Lord, encountering the turning of destiny, received the primordial dissemination of teachings, and the Dao found its proper course. Thus, the scriptures of the Numinous Treasure’s Great Cavern emerged, refining and molding the multitudes.\n\nThose who obtain these texts were once fellow recipients of the sagely intent, hearkening to the jade tones. A single lapse in discipline cast them into the cycles of transmigration, reborn as humans. If one truly recognizes the preciousness of the body, the difficulty of the Dao, and illuminates it, this may be called the return of numinous qi to the original palace, the return of the Perfected to their former seclusion.\n\nThus, the *Highest Numinous Treasure’s Pure Clarity Flying Immortals Scripture of Salvation* was spoken by the Primordial Beginning and recorded by the Dao Lord. Though the scripture exists, its methods remain concealed. The Celestial Sovereigns of the Sun and Moon Palaces, relying on these methods, expounded the scripture’s intent, elucidating the principles of the methods through the scripture. Yet unless the times demanded salvation, the turning of destiny shifted, and no revelation was granted.\n\nNow, entrusted with the governance of the Cavernous Spirit, I pity the discarded and the humble, cherishing even the ignorant among the lowly—all are the red children of the Great Brahmā. Thus, I venture to clarify the true, inadvertently revealing hidden truths, composing the *Scripture of Flying Immortals for Salvation* to restore the original intent.\n\nTherefore, I expound the methods through the scripture, honoring the master’s decree. I treat the scripture as incantation, following the master’s command. I narrate affairs through the methods, broadening the master’s aspirations.\n\nFirst is the \"Narrative of Subtleties,\" which speaks of the Dao’s all-encompassing nature—this is how subtleties are revealed. Next is the \"Exposition of the Scripture,\" which speaks of the Dao’s constancy as an enduring text. Finally, it is explained as the \"Exegetical Examples,\" enabling later adepts of lofty attainment to observe the explanations through the scripture and clarify the examples through the explanations.\n\nThe \"Narrative of Subtleties\" comprises one scroll, symbolizing Heaven. The \"Exegetical Examples\" comprise two scrolls, symbolizing Earth. Together, they form thirty-two chapters, symbolizing the Thirty-Two Heavens. The \"Exposition of the Scripture\" spans four scrolls, symbolizing the four seasons. This is to guide scholars to roam leisurely within, their spirits at ease and essence unified, becoming companions of Heaven—thus, nothing will lack its foundation.\n\n**Chapter of Natural True Principles**\n\nCharacters are the coagulation of qi. Talismans are the essence of characters. Incantations are the principle of characters. Intonation is the sound of characters. Written with cinnabar on paper, characters and talismans assume form through this medium. Recited orally, incantations thereby summon spirits and gods—this is the numinosity of qi, the harmony of qi.\n\nBy humans summoning spirits, and spirits summoning qi, refining qi into spirit, spirit and qi merge. Concentrating spirit and deploying qi, spirit and qi unite. As my body is fundamentally the utmost harmony, it resonates with the quintessential qi of Heaven and Earth—thus arises the method of ingesting characters and talismans. By comprehending the correct principles of Heaven and Earth and realizing them within oneself, contemplative transformation begins here.\n\nWithout the utmost refinement in the world, who could partake in this?\n\nWhy? The Dao is originally undifferentiated, formless and unnumbered. When the Dao disperses into *wen*, form is lodged within it. When it is formless and unnumbered, it is a profound, singular qi. As it scatters and becomes distinct, the Great Brahmā comes into being. The pure becomes Heaven; the turbid becomes Earth. Heaven is the first character; Earth, the second. The center is humanity—humanity is the third character.\n\nFrom humanity onward, Heaven’s first dispersion manifests as the intersecting brilliance of stars and constellations. Earth’s second dispersion manifests as the growth and propagation of plants, trees, mountains, and rivers. Humanity’s third dispersion manifests as the procreation of birds, beasts, insects, and fish.\n\nAll that possesses qi is one; all that possesses form is two; all that possesses qi and name is three. Thus, the principle of creation unfolds. From this, one may infer that all things molded and refined—what does not originate from the Great Brahmā?\n\nTracing the origin of human life: sageliness is established here, spirit operates here, and the Dao arises here. Spirit relies on sageliness to lodge in the Dao, and through humanity, it gains illumination. Thus, natural characters emerge as teachings.\n\nThe establishment of teachings makes the Dao manifest; the fulfillment of the Dao makes teachings numinous. Without the utmost numinosity in the world, who could partake in this? Those who illuminate the Dao embody the ancestral teachings and recognize that the body, too, is the qi of the Great Brahmā, congealed into a treasure. The clarity of nature and mind is also the Great Brahmā’s pure, lustrous, and luminous essence.\n\nThus, when one aligns with Heaven and Earth, the primordial creation is established, and Heaven and Earth shine resplendently within oneself. Heaven and Earth do not speak, yet harmonious sounds arise spontaneously. Humans do not speak, yet the celestial melody resonates of itself. The four seasons proceed without intent, for one’s primordial qi remains undisturbed within. Being undisturbed, Heaven and Earth’s most precious treasures, having no outlet, follow the qi to generate essence and gather spirit. If I conserve and store them, how could I not abound in ample abundance?\n\nThus, when my treasure unites with Heaven and Earth’s treasure, the names of lead and mercury arise; the forms of talismanic characters take shape; the outflow of qi and fluid manifests as their flavor; the emanation of sacred chapters resounds as their sound. Knowing sound, name, form, and flavor, one becomes a connoisseur of the treasure. When the treasure is complete, the chamber is enriched; when the chamber is enriched, the will is fulfilled—thus attaining true communion. Without the utmost scholar in the world, who could partake in this? Attaining the purest essence, achieving the utmost numinosity, and preserving the utmost unity, the true principle becomes clear. Naturally, the true chapter is accomplished.\n\nHeaven and Earth are qi; the human body is also qi. Heaven and Earth have the sun and moon; the human body has the eyes. Heaven and Earth have rivers, mountains, and peaks; the human body has qi channels, bones, and flesh. Heaven and Earth have the Five Phases; the human body has the five viscera. Moreover, Heaven and Earth have the Five Phases’ movement governing the four seasons; humans likewise use the five viscera to govern the four limbs. Grasping this principle, one lives; failing to grasp it, one dies.\n\nTherefore, following Heaven and Earth’s true nature and uniting with the body’s true qi, only correctness avoids delusion. This is the foundation of meditative visualization and summoning, the essence of audience at the origin. Generally, ascending as an immortal liberates one’s original lineage. Having illuminated the Great Brahmā’s qi, the Great Brahmā is within me. I can summon qi with qi, thus achieving harmony through harmony. Through meditative visualization and sutra recitation, the three qi pervade the chamber, and lions and white cranes fill the space before me.\n\nThe green qi is the heart’s fire, flourishing through Wood; the white qi is the kidneys’ water, gleaming through Metal; yellow attains its correct principle. Thus, green emerges from the head, white from the feet, and yellow from the navel. The lion, a creature of righteousness, is the lungs’ surplus; the white crane, a bird of benevolence, is the liver’s surplus. Crouching displays its majesty; flying exalts its beauty. With majesty and beauty complete, the numinous responds. When emitted as essence, sincerity elicits no lack of response; when expressed as numinous sound, nothing is impenetrable. Why? Because inner repletion elicits outer resonance.\n\nWhat is inner repletion? The kidneys’ purple qi ascends, uniting water and fire; the lungs’ generative qi suspends, binding to the Jade Void. Suspended, it surges and bursts forth, likened to the twelve-tiered Jade Tower. The tower is the throat; the Purple Gate is the mouth. The Golden Pavilion and Jade Hall are also the kidneys’ root. The Eight Steeds are the Eight Sceneries. Their activation for function arises from the primordial qi. The cinnabar chamber is the spleen’s position. When the spleen and kidneys are established, the lungs’ sound responds. After the lion’s response, the heart’s essence and liver’s fluid unite in function.\n\nThus, the sun and moon may be chewed; here, the heart’s palace opens, the lung’s courtyard aligns, the purple qi revolves to the right, connecting with the Dipper, and the kidneys’ primordial root is established. Exiting and entering the Golden Gate, the spleen communicates with the numinous. The Immortal Lord descends, and the liver’s origin is rectified. All this arises from the One and culminates in the One, becoming numinous. Internally, it permeates the body; externally, it resonates with Heaven and Earth. Through such visualization, breath stabilizes, winds and clouds may be summoned, the divine ranks approached, and transcendence achieved—like returning home at dusk. Then, the thirty-two heavens’ qi and colors may be comprehended.\n\nWhat are the thirty-two heavens’ qi? They are the nine qi. The nine blacks are the Five Phases’ black. The thirty-two heavens correspond to the human skull’s thirty-two joints and the crown’s thirty-two orifices. Thus, the so-called thirty-two heavens are within the body. Yellow is Earth; white is Metal; red is Fire; green is Wood; black is Water. Yellow and green combine to form green; black and green combine to form dark green; green and white combine to form azure; black and red combine to form purple. All arise from the interpenetration of acupoints and the communion of mysterious qi.\n\nWithin humans, it is thus. In Heaven, the East governs birth, the South growth, the West harvest, and the North storage. The offices of birth, growth, harvest, and storage may coincide. The Heaven of Sovereign Zeng, in the northeast, is fundamentally green-black and dark green, yet appears yellow—this is the Yellow Bell’s palace, the qi’s inception, for without Earth, the myriad things do not arise. The Heaven of Harmonious Yang, in the East, is fundamentally green and red, yet appears white—this is when the myriad things enter the position of civil brilliance, the time of white receiving adornment. The Heaven of Ascending Perfection, in the southwest, is fundamentally a blend of red and white, yet unifies in purple. When white and black share the same body, white is the essence, black the function. Their convergence, where white gathers and reverses to azure, is when water employs white as its function and perishes. Their conjunction is called azure.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens are governed by thirty-two emperors, some synthesizing life and adjudicating death, others overseeing culture and deciding judgments.\n\nThe offices and positions harmonize with the qi of nature, radiating the colors of nature. The five viscera within humans, arrayed like palace chambers, likewise correspond to Heaven. Thus, the five viscera do not operate in isolation, nor do the five qi govern alone—they mutually engender and overcome, with root and branch alternately employed.\n\nThe soft root is water; water’s moisture engenders wood, wood’s straightness engenders fire, fire’s flame engenders earth, earth’s substance engenders metal, and metal’s hardness, when extreme, reverses—its child turns to water. If one can regulate and apply these movements, moderating actions and dispersing or gathering as needed, this embodies the principle of nourishing through breath. Practicing this transforms evil into goodness.\n\nHarmonizing with righteousness and aligning with principle, the five phases cycle endlessly, circulating without cease. They refine the five phases to govern the five qi. From the five qi, the five virtues are united. Once the five virtues are established, one becomes an immortal. If one indulges without cultivation, decay leads to becoming a ghost. Ghosts return to darkness and endure suffering; immortals ascend to brightness and enjoy bliss.\n\nAll this is achieved by establishing the Dao through practice and attaining immortality through merit. Thus, my method of *flying immortals delivering people* is merely the means by which the enlightened cross to the other shore.\n\n*The Explanatory Examples of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Scripture of Flying Immortals Delivering People* concludes.",

Heaven and Earth do not speak, yet harmonious sounds arise spontaneously. Humans do not speak, yet the celestial melody resonates of itself. The four seasons proceed without intent, for one’s primordial qi remains undisturbed within. Being undisturbed, Heaven and Earth’s most precious treasures, having no outlet, follow the qi to generate essence and gather spirit. If I conserve and store them, how could I not abound in ample abundance?\n\nThus, when my treasure unites with Heaven and Earth’s treasure, the names of lead and mercury arise; the forms of talismanic characters take shape; the outflow of qi and fluid manifests as their flavor; the emanation of sacred chapters resounds as their sound. Knowing sound, name, form, and flavor, one becomes a connoisseur of the treasure. When the treasure is complete, the chamber is enriched; when the chamber is enriched, the will is fulfilled—thus attaining true communion. Without the utmost scholar in the world, who could partake in this? Attaining the purest essence, achieving the utmost numinosity, and preserving the utmost unity, the true principle becomes clear. Naturally, the true chapter is accomplished.\n\nHeaven and Earth are qi; the human body is also qi. Heaven and Earth have the sun and moon; the human body has the eyes. Heaven and Earth have rivers, mountains, and peaks; the human body has qi channels, bones, and flesh. Heaven and Earth have the Five Phases; the human body has the five viscera. Moreover, Heaven and Earth have the Five Phases’ movement governing the four seasons; humans likewise use the five viscera to govern the four limbs. Grasping this principle, one lives; failing to grasp it, one dies.\n\nTherefore, following Heaven and Earth’s true nature and uniting with the body’s true qi, only correctness avoids delusion. This is the foundation of meditative visualization and summoning, the essence of audience at the origin. Generally, ascending as an immortal liberates one’s original lineage. Having illuminated the Great Brahmā’s qi, the Great Brahmā is within me. I can summon qi with qi, thus achieving harmony through harmony. Through meditative visualization and sutra recitation, the three qi pervade the chamber, and lions and white cranes fill the space before me.\n\nThe green qi is the heart’s fire, flourishing through Wood; the white qi is the kidneys’ water, gleaming through Metal; yellow attains its correct principle. Thus, green emerges from the head, white from the feet, and yellow from the navel. The lion, a creature of righteousness, is the lungs’ surplus; the white crane, a bird of benevolence, is the liver’s surplus. Crouching displays its majesty; flying exalts its beauty. With majesty and beauty complete, the numinous responds. When emitted as essence, sincerity elicits no lack of response; when expressed as numinous sound, nothing is impenetrable. Why? Because inner repletion elicits outer resonance.\n\nWhat is inner repletion? The kidneys’ purple qi ascends, uniting water and fire; the lungs’ generative qi suspends, binding to the Jade Void. Suspended, it surges and bursts forth, likened to the twelve-tiered Jade Tower. The tower is the throat; the Purple Gate is the mouth. The Golden Pavilion and Jade Hall are also the kidneys’ root. The Eight Steeds are the Eight Sceneries. Their activation for function arises from the primordial qi. The cinnabar chamber is the spleen’s position. When the spleen and kidneys are established, the lungs’ sound responds. After the lion’s response, the heart’s essence and liver’s fluid unite in function.\n\nThus, the sun and moon may be chewed; here, the heart’s palace opens, the lung’s courtyard aligns, the purple qi revolves to the right, connecting with the Dipper, and the kidneys’ primordial root is established. Exiting and entering the Golden Gate, the spleen communicates with the numinous. The Immortal Lord descends, and the liver’s origin is rectified. All this arises from the One and culminates in the One, becoming numinous. Internally, it permeates the body; externally, it resonates with Heaven and Earth. Through such visualization, breath stabilizes, winds and clouds may be summoned, the divine ranks approached, and transcendence achieved—like returning home at dusk. Then, the thirty-two heavens’ qi and colors may be comprehended.\n\nWhat are the thirty-two heavens’ qi? They are the nine qi. The nine blacks are the Five Phases’ black. The thirty-two heavens correspond to the human skull’s thirty-two joints and the crown’s thirty-two orifices. Thus, the so-called thirty-two heavens are within the body. Yellow is Earth; white is Metal; red is Fire; green is Wood; black is Water. Yellow and green combine to form green; black and green combine to form dark green; green and white combine to form azure; black and red combine to form purple. All arise from the interpenetration of acupoints and the communion of mysterious qi.\n\nWithin humans, it is thus. In Heaven, the East governs birth, the South growth, the West harvest, and the North storage. The offices of birth, growth, harvest, and storage may coincide. The Heaven of Sovereign Zeng, in the northeast, is fundamentally green-black and dark green, yet appears yellow—this is the Yellow Bell’s palace, the qi’s inception, for without Earth, the myriad things do not arise. The Heaven of Harmonious Yang, in the East, is fundamentally green and red, yet appears white—this is when the myriad things enter the position of civil brilliance, the time of white receiving adornment. The Heaven of Ascending Perfection, in the southwest, is fundamentally a blend of red and white, yet unifies in purple. When white and black share the same body, white is the essence, black the function. Their convergence, where white gathers and reverses to azure, is when water employs white as its function and perishes. Their conjunction is called azure.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens are governed by thirty-two emperors, some synthesizing life and adjudicating death, others overseeing culture and deciding judgments.",

From this, one may infer that all things molded and refined—what does not originate from the Great Brahmā?\n\nTracing the origin of human life: sageliness is established here, spirit operates here, and the Dao arises here. Spirit relies on sageliness to lodge in the Dao, and through humanity, it gains illumination. Thus, natural characters emerge as teachings.",

      "translated_text": "The offices and positions harmonize with the qi of nature, radiating the colors of nature. The five viscera within humans, arrayed like palace chambers, likewise correspond to Heaven. Thus, the five viscera do not operate in isolation, nor do the five qi govern alone—they mutually engender and overcome, with root and branch alternately employed.\n\nThe soft root is water; water’s moisture engenders wood, wood’s straightness engenders fire, fire’s flame engenders earth, earth’s substance engenders metal, and metal’s hardness, when extreme, reverses—its child turns to water. If one can regulate and apply these movements, moderating actions and dispersing or gathering as needed, this embodies the principle of nourishing through breath. Practicing this transforms evil into goodness.\n\nHarmonizing with righteousness and aligning with principle, the five phases cycle endlessly, circulating without cease. They refine the five phases to govern the five qi. From the five qi, the five virtues are united. Once the five virtues are established, one becomes an immortal. If one indulges without cultivation, decay leads to becoming a ghost. Ghosts return to darkness and endure suffering; immortals ascend to brightness and enjoy bliss.\n\nAll this is achieved by establishing the Dao through practice and attaining immortality through merit. Thus, my method of *flying immortals delivering people* is merely the means by which the enlightened cross to the other shore.\n\n*The Explanatory Examples of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Scripture of Flying Immortals Delivering People* concludes.",
