  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Text of the Numinous Writ: True Record of Immortal Taboos, First Scroll**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Text of the Numinous Writ: True Record of Immortal Taboos, First Scroll* (abbreviated as *True Record of Immortal Taboos*).\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. Originally part of *The Purple Text of the Numinous Writ*.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Precepts and Disciplines* Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Lads of Fangzhu transmitted this from the Supreme Clarity to Gong Zhongyang and Youyang of the Vermilion Mound of the Southern Heaven, instructing them to bestow it upon the perfected ones of the Southern Palace.\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Lads said: The difficulties of attaining immortality are not of one kind. These are not the common hardships of the worldly realm, for the trials of immortality are inherently beyond what can be recorded in writing. Though a person may bear the signs of an immortal and be destined for ascension, there are ten conditions that corrupt the immortal’s form. Even if one relies upon these signs, should they transgress and corrupt them, they shall not attain immortality. Now, I secretly reveal these to those who bear such signs—let them uphold them with care.\n\n**First:** Do not indulge in licentiousness. Licentiousness causes the soul’s essence to leak outward, the radiance of essence to wither, the spirit to scorch, and the po to scatter. The bones grow thin, the marrow foul, the soul wails in the numinous palace, and word reaches the celestial halls. The Three Palaces vie for dominance, the embryonic flower grieves in disorder—this is the first corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Second:** Do not harbor malice, cruelty, or malevolence. Malevolence throws the Yellow Court into chaos, the Three Corpses delight in slaughter, the hun-spirit spies on treachery, and the po-ghost invades the chamber. The eyes’ light scatters like weapons, and the mouth emits harmful qi—this is the second corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Third:** Do not become drunk on wine. Drunkenness causes the bodily form to decay, the divine spirits to intermingle in confusion, the hun to forget its true abode, and the po to wander into depraved dwellings. The Red Child soars recklessly, the throat and brain’s fire is exhausted—this is the third corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Fourth:** Do not be filthy, slothful, or negligent. Filth and negligence cause the pure and numinous to lose their authenticity, the essence and hun to abandon their dwelling. The Three Palaces breed worms, the Red Child drifts aimlessly, the blood turns turbid, the marrow reeks, the spirit’s light loses its sanctuary, and the po flees through the demonic gate. Seeking the scriptures of death—this is the fourth corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Fifth:** Do not consume the flesh of the animal corresponding to your parents’ life-destiny. Doing so severs the original form, destroys the beginning, and uproots the foundation. The fetal spirit wails in lament, the Crimson Lord cries out in longing, the Three Hun grow venomous, and the po searches for graves. Once this flesh enters the mouth, life plunges into eternal night—this is the fifth corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Sixth:** Do not consume the flesh of the animal corresponding to your own life-destiny. Doing so violates the true form and spirit, the Mud Pill Palace crumbles, the gates of the Three Palaces close, the Infant mingles in confusion, the hun-soul flees in pursuit, and the po seeks a coffin—this is the sixth corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Seventh:** Do not consume the flesh of the six domestic animals. Doing so causes the qi-form to stagnate in foulness, the essence-spirit to grow turbid and sluggish. The brain turns yellow, the teeth wither, the spleen nurtures dead qi, the hun cannot receive the true, and the po generates a single, surging evil. The body sinks into the abyss, the bones long to be buried in earth—this is the seventh corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Eighth:** Do not consume the five pungent vegetables. Doing so causes the Five Viscera to reek, the Three Flowers to dissolve in chaos, the spirit to fail in proper communication, and the essence-embryo to sink downward. The hun and po grow estranged, the Red Child becomes weary and listless, the flying spirit loses its guard, and the eyes’ light scatters—this is the eighth corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Ninth:** Do not kill living beings, from insects upward. Doing so arms the myriad things against you, binding your bones in blood-grudges. The form grows violent, the po ferocious, the hun-qi locked in battle. The fetal spirit wanders in distress, the true child flees, the Mud Pill Palace turns treacherous, the Red Child abandons you, and the corpse-form boils in cauldrons, stewed in water and scorched by fire—this is the ninth corruption of the immortal’s form.\n\n**Tenth:** Do not face north while relieving yourself or bending over; do not gaze upward at the Three Luminaries while facing north. Do not face north while cutting your hair, removing your clothes, or spitting in anger. Do not curse while facing north, for this violates and destroys the King. \"Violation\" refers to the earthly branch of the year, and \"King\" refers to the dwelling of the royal qi. Do not rage at the sun, moon, or stars; do not execute punishments on the eight solar terms; do not harbor anger on the first day of the lunar month; do not consume the flesh of creatures with shells—tortoises, dragons, or scaled beings—on the days of the six jia; do not consume pheasant on bing-wu days; do not consume the flesh of black beasts on bing-zi days; do not engage in yin-yang affairs or share a bed with a woman on geng-shen days; do not become severely drunk on yi-mao days; do not kill living beings while facing north on the fourth day of the first lunar month; do not consume fish on the ninth day of the second lunar month; do not consume the flesh of the Five Viscera or the hearts of grasses on the third day of the third lunar month; do not cut grass or fell trees on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month; do not draw blood on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month; do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month; do not dwell on evil deeds on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month; do not purchase footwear or anything that attaches to the feet on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month; do not shake out or beat mats on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month; do not punish or reprimand others on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month; do not bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh lunar month; do not fail to fast, burn incense, or invoke the immortals during the last three days of the twelfth lunar month.\n\nTaboos such as these are the great prohibitions of heaven and humanity. The Three Officials record and examine them, deeming them grave offenses. They may cause the Three Hun to turn against one another, the Seven Po to scatter in contention, or the fetal spirit to grow resentful, bringing the Three Palaces under the sway of evil. Thus, nightmares assail the cinnabar heart, demonic beings seize the vermilion gate, essence and fluids transgress, and the divine spirits grow disoriented. The transformations and prohibitions are manifold, and none recognize the arts of avoidance. If you can uphold and cultivate these precepts, you shall become a vessel for immortality. If you defy the heavenly prohibitions, you shall bring ruin upon yourself.\n\nOn the day of the Autumn Equinox, all who study the Dao must preserve their authenticity and observe abstinence. Do not harbor wicked or evil thoughts; let your heart constantly aspire to ascend as an immortal. The divine beings of old said:\n\n*\"If you wish to ascend to heaven, be cautious on the Autumn Equinox.\nNo sin is too great or small—all are heard above.\nTo seek immortality with sin is most difficult;\nThus, those who study the Dao grow cold at heart.\"*\n\nThese are truly essential words.\n\nIf you are a Daoist who observes perpetual fasting, at noon on the Autumn Equinox, you must repent for the transgressions of your seven ancestors, your parents, and yourself, vowing to reform.\n\nShould one not possess the true and unwavering nature of one who has severed worldly ties, take utmost care on this day to repent of sins—take utmost care.\n\nThe Azure Lad said:\n*\"You may deem the signs of immortality unurgent, yet you must recognize the signs of ruin as most critical. Those mired in the world’s filth possess only the outward form of bones—how could they comprehend the subtle path of harmonizing signs?\"*\n\nFor those who study the Dao, the foremost duty is to widely cultivate hidden virtue, extend compassion toward all beings, rescue others from hardship, deliver them from peril, value the Dao above wealth, bestow kindness, and spread virtue. Spare no treasure, even casting it into destitution, and with sincere qi, kneel in humble supplication.\n\nThus, the ancients’ most profound teaching spoke of *\"plowing and sowing the field of blessings to ascend as an immortal.\"*\n\nHere ends the *Upper Scripture of the Purple Text of the Celestial Taboos from the Numinous Writ of the Grand Tenuity*.",
