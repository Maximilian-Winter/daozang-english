  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*. Originally in one scroll, now rearranged into two. The base text of the upper scroll derives from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Washing Mystery Section, Original Texts Category); collated with Dunhuang manuscript P.2865 (first half). The base text of the lower scroll is Dunhuang manuscript P.2865 (second half); collated with Dunhuang manuscript S.298.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life, Scroll One**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Ever-Joyful Abode, instructing seven thousand two hundred and forty youths. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the youths of superior wisdom and the Wheel-Turning Celestial Youths advanced, made obeisance, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Today, as we attend your seat, our joy is beyond measure. The heavens have opened their grace, and all is radiant with light. The dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits—all have been liberated and restored to blessedness. The Three Offices have ceased their accusations, and the living and the dead rejoice together.\n\nYet the souls of the departed, though freed, have not yet entered the Wheel of Rebirth. Their corporeal spirits scatter and fall, their rotting bones devoid of moisture, sinking into the ninefold earth, strewn across the subterranean bureaus. Their wandering souls drift in anguish, unable to return. The Earthly Offices press for reckoning, their bodily forms restless, enduring renewed sorrow and oppression, gazing upward to implore the heavens.\n\nNow that grace has been extended and all is made anew, the August Dao flows freely, its blessings reaching the ten directions. We have heard that the Heavenly Worthy has bestowed great compassion; we pray that the August Mercy be universally applied. Grant that those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be born be born, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should return be returned. If their karmic bonds are not yet severed and they cannot return, their bodily forms remain in their former abodes, concealed in the nine springs. Harassed by myriad spirits, they find no refuge, their wandering souls adrift, returning to afflict their descendants.\n\nSince the Great Transformation has arisen, it is fitting that all be universally absolved. We do not know if there are further essential methods within the Dharma that may be proclaimed, to be announced to the Earthly Offices, so that they may pacify, console, and shelter them, allowing all to find peace. Let the nine bureaus be duly distinguished, and their bodies guarded and tended. If you deign to show compassion, then all under heaven will rejoice in harmony, the living and the dead bearing no resentment, and blessings will flow for a hundred million kalpas, endless through the ages.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy universally commanded the Heavenly Thearchs, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Great Sage Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Flying Celestial Divine Kings, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Southern Supreme Life-Nurturing and World-Delivering Sima, the Recorders of Deeds and Lords of Destiny, the Perfected Ones of Longevity, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the various Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts—all to resume their seats. \"Now I shall further expound the Dharma gates for the youths of superior wisdom, clarifying the ancient canons of the Dragon Han and Mystic Capital, the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms* and the *Scripture of the Maiden of Azure Jade*, to deliver the dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits, that all may behold the light.\n\nProclaim to the heavens, that each may elucidate the spontaneous jade scripts of their celestial names. Universally announce to the celestial and terrestrial water bureaus, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Three Realms and Five Thearchs, the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks, the earthly officials of the nine lands, the Caverns of Primordial, Abyssal, Void, Numinous, and Non-Being, the Limitless and Boundless, the measureless heights and depths, the formless and colorless, the soundless and silent, the immeasurably vast and minute—all spirits and numina, each according to their appointed tasks.\n\nNow, for those under your jurisdiction—those souls condemned for past transgressions—record their good and evil deeds, merits and faults, years, months, and days. Itemize each matter, distinguish their former abodes and the whereabouts of their bodily forms, and according to their respective domains, console and shelter them. Let the earthly deities guard and protect them, tend and provide for them, allowing no disturbance, so that they may achieve fruition according to their merits. Let those who should be transferred be transferred, those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should be born be born. Let the records of the fallen be reviewed, the vows of the waters absolved, the celestial decrees of punishment erased, and all be made manifest.\"\n\nThereupon, the assembly of the fourfold host and the youths of superior wisdom rejoiced, made obeisance, and simultaneously raised their hands, snapping their fingers in praise.\n\nAt that moment, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs took their seats and commanded the Flying Celestial Divine Beings to unfurl the Purple Yang Jade Terrace, open the Luminous True Jade Casket, and retrieve the celestial, spontaneously arisen jade scriptures of the *Infinite Cavern Chapters* from the Heavenly Center. These were entrusted to the Earthly Offices to deliver all beings, pacify the corpse, guard the numen, and preserve the soul and spirit.\n\nThe Great Yellow August Heaven of Zeng, the Great Bright Jade Perfect Heaven, the Clear Bright How-Youth Heaven, the Mystic Womb Nurturing Heaven, the Primordial Bright Literary Flourishing Heaven, the Seven Luminaries Majestic Heaven, the Void Transcendent Balance Heaven, and the Supreme Ultimate Veiled Heaven—these eight heavens together possess eight characters, totaling sixty-four, which are assigned to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords of the East. By the Azure Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Eastern Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Edicts*.\n\nThe Bright Crimson Harmonious Yang Heaven, the Mystic Bright Reverent Flourishing Heaven, the Radiant Bright Ancestral Whirling Heaven, the Bamboo Grove August Reed Heaven, the Void Bright Hall Radiance Heaven, the Contemplative Bright Upright Tranquility Heaven, the Mystic Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven, and the Supreme Resplendent Ultimate Jade Heaven—these eight heavens together possess eight characters, totaling sixty-four, which are assigned to the Three Qi Heavenly Lords of the South. By the Crimson Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Southern Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the South, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Edicts*.\n\nThe Primordial Loaded Perforated Ascent Heaven, the Supreme Peace August Cliff Heaven, the Manifestly Fixed Ultimate Wind Heaven, the Beginning August Filial Awn Heaven, the Supreme Yellow Venerable Heavy Heaven, the No-Thought River Origin Heaven, the Upper Dice Joyous Heaven, and the Limitless Cloud Vow Heaven—these eight heavens...\n\nThe heavens possess eight characters, combining into sixty-four, which are assigned to the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords of the West. By the White Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Western Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the West, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Edicts*.\n\nThe Radiant Court Rosy Ascent Heaven, the Abyssal Permeation Primordial Grotto Heaven, the Soaring Honor Wondrous Completion Heaven, the Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven, the Peerless Constant Fusion Heaven, the Jade Exaltation Ascendant Victory Heaven, the Dragon Transformation Brahmanic Deliverance Heaven, and the Level Nurturing Splendid Brilliance Heaven—these eight heavens possess eight characters, combining into sixty-four, which are assigned to the Five Qi Heavenly Lords of the North. By the Black Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Northern Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the North, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Edicts*.\n\nThe Supreme Supreme Supreme One Qi One Qi, the Supreme Supreme Supreme Limitless Peakless Colorless, the Heaven of the Great Net’s Natural Jade Script, governs the Central Yellow Primordial Heavenly Lord. By the Yellow Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Central Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the Center, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Transmissions*.\n\nEach heaven dispatches its Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, who, with the *Heavenly Center’s Numinous Sound Natural Jade Script Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, jointly proclaim to the Earthly Offices of the Five Directions, Five Thearchs, and Five Marchmounts. They each comply with the talismanic commands, reverently upholding the Great Dao.\n\nThe August Dao now made manifest, the heavens cleared and the qi settled; the Three Luminaries halted their wheels, the stellar lodges shone resplendently, the celestial pivots ceased their motion, rivers and seas stilled in silence, mountains and peaks swallowed their mists. The seasons harmonized, the qi purified, golden winds brushed away the dust, the heavens held no drifting veils, sun and moon bathed in radiance. The Five Sufferings dissolved, the long night’s souls awakened, withered trees blossomed anew, the dead regained their forms, unicorns danced and phoenixes soared, their joyful cries filling the air. The heavens leapt in exultation, scattering flowers and chanting praises.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, filled with delight, intoned this hymn:\n\nThe Crimson Clarity returns to transformation,\nMerging with you yet dividing.\nYin and yang refine and change,\nTheir Dao naturally so.\nThe Mysterious Chart turns sevenfold,\nTo nine it still returns.\nThe Primordial Mandate’s numinous script,\nBoundless are its cavernous chapters.\nThe ranks of the impermanent,\nTheir qi unites the Nine Mornings.\nYang’s light stealthily stirs,\nBright effulgences ride the mist.\nThree revolutions, five refinements,\nHarmonized with the Seven Streams.\nFollowing their hues, they flourish and shine,\nEach returning to their original spirits.\nThe Great Dao simplifies deliverance,\nWithered bones regain their forms.\nTreasure my wondrous Dao,\nAscend to the rank of Upper Perfected.\nReturn to the Five Refinements,\nThe supreme Dao’s highest numen.\nIlluminating sun and moon,\nPervading the Nine Clarities.\nThe heavens open their grace,\nThe dark night’s mystery clears.\nWithered bones transcend their steps,\nRefined transformations arise of themselves.\nInhaling and exhaling the numinous harmony,\nPiercing the dark to enter the hidden.\nSpirits wondrously transform ten thousandfold,\nFlying souls return to their forms.\nRiding the mist and mounting the void,\nThey ascend to the August Court.\nThe Jade Script proclaims the mandate,\nThe Earthly Offices attain great peace.\nAll who receive deliverance\nUniversally enter the light.\nPossessing my precious script,\nGeneration after generation, they transform and live.\nCareless leaks and wanton disclosures\nWill meet the wind’s blade in punishment.\nThe Jade Chapters’ numinous script births vermilion light,\nThe Five Numinous coalesce their essence, illuminating the ten directions.\nThe four eights divide their positions, uniting the Five Phases,\nThe stellar lodges, sun, moon, yin, and yang flow in communion.\nEstablishing the Heavenly Perfected to protect the Supreme August,\nOpening the Dharma-gate to unify all.\nThe Great Thousand of the Maitreya Dao flourishes,\nThe golden throne’s joy cannot be constant.\nThe heavens leap in exultation, offering numinous hymns,\nOpening my wondrous Dao to enlighten the young.\nMay you, through kalpas without end, live without limit,\nNinefold refined into Perfected, enthroned as Immortal Kings.\nGuard this within your breast, take care not to divulge it.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy finished his hymn. The Heavenly Thearchs, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Ten Directions’ Limitless Perfected Great Sages, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Five Venerable Thearch Lords, the Southern Supreme Life-Nurturing and World-Delivering Sima, the Recorders and Life-Mandate Officers, the Upper Numinous Immortals, the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maidens, the various Primordial Lords and Numinous Consorts, the Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts—seven thousand two hundred and forty youths—all rose as one. Pinching incense and scattering flowers, they circumambulated thrice to the left, then turned northward to bow, raising their hands and snapping their fingers.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodges all shone brightly at once. The Nine Dark Abysses of the netherworld’s limitless caverns were pervaded by luminous mystery, no longer shrouded in darkness, their hidden depths universally revealed. The Earth Treasury released its stores, gold and jade revealed their forms, mountains and rivers, streams and ravines, all leveled in vast evenness. White bones received qi, withered corpses regained their souls, the Nine Lands attained purity and peace, the Earthly Offices found tranquility, all beings received universal deliverance, none left unenlightened.\n\nThe Great Dao flowed and transformed, the August Way unfolded. Universally proclaimed to the heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the celestial pivots and jade balances, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Life-Mandate and Record Officers, Han Jun the Master Recorder, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, all earthly and aquatic realms, the Five Marchmounts’ numinous mountains, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, the Long Night’s Bureau within the Nine Darks, the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs—all numinous beings, each obeying the Great Dao, universally rejoiced as one, taking this day as new. Without above or below, without limit or end, without depth or distance, without darkness or concealment, without bounds or edges, without great or small, without beginning or end—all spirits, with a snap of their fingers, received the mandate and complied, reverently following.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Azure Thearch Refines and Delivers the Five Immortals, Pacifies the Numinous and Mirrors the Divine Nine Qi Heavenly Script\n\nThe Nine Qi Azure Heaven of the East receives the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, proclaimed to the Earthly Offices and divine realms of the Eastern Limitless World. Now, the Supreme Clarity’s faithful disciple So-and-So, having extinguished the Five Immortals, entrusts their corpse to the Great Yin. Today, within such-and-such a realm, a palace hall is established, sheltering their form beneath the earth, clearly upholding the Orthodox Dao, offering solace and consolation. The Azure Numinous nourishes with sweet dew, the Nine Qi present their morning blossoms, their essence and light brimming over, refining and adorning their bodily forms. Their bones become fragrant, their flesh perfumed, enduring kalpas without decay.\n\nThe Eastern Marchmount Mount Tai illuminates and opens the Nine Dark Halls of the Long Night, summoning forth the soul-spirit of So-and-So, who is bathed, robed, and crowned, then transferred to the Southern Palace, where clothing and sustenance are provided. Abiding ever in radiance, demons dare not intrude; all numinous spirits attend and guard in peace, precisely as decreed in the ancient *Nüqing* scriptures of the Primordial Beginning’s covenant with the perfected. This text is inscribed in black upon green stone, and the master, having prostrated and presented the yellow silk memorial, buries it in the easternmost boundary of the tomb where the deceased’s bodily form lies. At the moment of burial, the master performs the Nine-Step Yu Pace, advancing to the site, faces east, and recites the large characters and the text in full. He then strikes his teeth twenty-four times, swallows qi nine times, and intones the incantation:\n\nBy the talismanic command of the Primordial Beginning, a universal proclamation is issued to the Earthly Offices and divine realms of the Eastern Limitless World, to the Nine Qi General Controller of the Cavernous Void, the Cavernous Non-Being, the Cavernous Profound, and the Cavernous Primordial, and to all netherworld spirits and boundless divine kings of the Three Realms. Today is a day of great celebration: the Azure Heaven’s first yang arises, the exalted chariot assumes its rightful place, and the myriad Dao open forth. So-and-So receives deliverance, entrusts their corpse to the Mysterious Chamber, and as a faithful disciple of the Supreme Clarity, their soul ascends in response. The Five Immortals bathe, their garments are brushed and adorned, their form sheltered in the numinous prison, the earth itself parting to make way. Jade maidens are invoked to pacify and guard the divine palace; all attendants and guardians provide sustenance naturally. When the soul returns to the body, the Celestial Thearch will welcome it—all shall proceed as in the ancient statutes of the Illuminated Perfected.\n\nUpon completion, the text is buried in the earth.\n\n---\n\nThe Vermilion Numinous and Mirrors the Divine Three Qi Heavenly Script\n\nThe Three Qi Vermilion Heaven of the South receives the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, proclaimed to the Earthly Offices and divine realms of the Southern Limitless World.

Today is an auspicious day: the Great Yang announces the cinnabar, So-and-So returns to the Mysterious, entrusts their corpse to the Nine Mysteries, their rank equal to the Flying Celestials, and receives the revolving wheel of emptiness. Their soul ascends to the Vermilion Mound, where the Five Immortals are refined and delivered.

The master then strikes the teeth twenty-four times and holds the breath seven cycles.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, universally proclaimed to the Western Numinous Limitless Realm’s Earthly Mansion deities, the Cavernous Void’s Cavernous Non-Being’s Cavernous Mysterious Cavernous Pure Seven Qi General Directorate, the Three Realms’ Divine Courts of the Western Quarter, all myriad qi’s nether numinous limitless divine kings who oversee the verification of truth and deliverance of beings: Today, the Five Harmonies converge; the Lesser Yin announces the covenant.

Request the Jade Texts and talismanic decrees of the *Nüqing* from the heavens, and proclaim them to the spirit officials of the Northern Quarter. Deliver the hungry ghosts and dead souls from the Nine Nether Hells, the Three Paths, and the Five Sufferings of the North, opening the way to radiance. Secure the deceased’s bodily form in their dwelling, that they may abide in enduring peace, unshaken, as decreed in the *Nüqing* scriptures.\n\nThe Flying Celestials declare: According to the statutes of Illuminated Perfection, the Son of Heaven shall use bolts of silk in full measure, while dukes, kings, and lords of states shall use lengths in *zhang*. All must employ patterned silk, gilded to accord with the celestial signs as a token of faith. Commoners shall use lengths in *chi*, with iron as a substitute for gold. Proclaim this to all beings under Heaven, that all may hear.\n\nThe Flying Celestials declare: To secure and pacify the bodily form of the deceased, the local spirit officials must offer comfort and solace, that the dead may swiftly return, be reborn into a blessed existence, prosper their families, and perpetuate their lineages without end. In accordance with the statutes of Illuminated Perfection, the Son of Heaven and kings shall offer five *liang* of gold to honor the Five Emperors and pacify the Five Directions. Commoners shall use fifty *jin* of iron. This token of faith in the karmic conditions of life, death, and deliverance brings boundless merit. Proclaim this to all beings under Heaven, that all may hear.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declares: The scriptures for delivering and redeeming sinful souls from past transgressions, and for securing the bodily form and dwelling of the deceased, originate from the era before the Dragon Han. The Heavenly Worthy commanded the revelation of this great Dharma to instruct the divine youths. The great deities of the heavens unveiled the profound mysteries of the Dragon Han, expounding the esoteric texts of the Cavernous Mystery. They liberated those confined in the Long Night’s abode, allowing the Nine Nether Hells to bask in the light of the Great Sun. Lonely spirits may thus return, and decayed remains find connection, so that the Hall of Blessings may be attained. Clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and the Flying Celestials may be encountered in fellowship, escorting one as a guest of the Most High. This Dharma is lofty and wondrous, beyond all praise. Let all assembled—great multitudes and divine youths—cherish it well.\n\nThereupon, the four assemblies simultaneously prostrated, touching their heads to the ground, extolling its virtue before withdrawing.\n\n*The Upper Scroll of the Most High Wondrous Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life* concludes here.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High Wondrous Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure on the Five Refining Methods to Restore the Corpse, Lower Scroll\n\n**The Yellow Chapter Rite of the Numinous Treasure’s Five Transmutations for Pacifying the Spirit and Securing the Divine**\n\nThe Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s Red Emperor, Perfected Master of the Utmost Truth, your servant Wang Jia, bows his head and respectfully addresses: Above, above, above—one qi, one qi; above, above, above—boundless, without summit, without color, without light, the vast and true Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, and the Jade Sovereign of the Most High Great Dao.\n\nYour servant, entrusted with the great transformation of the Primordial Origin, has witnessed the heavens open the dark prisons of the earthly hells, liberating the three paths, the five sufferings, and the hungry ghosts and dead souls from the Long Night, all bathed in radiant light. The imperial Dao having refined them, the decayed remains return to humanity; the Three Realms are purified, and the Earthly Bureau attains peace. Yet those who have perished, whose corpses are entrusted to the Great Yin and whose forms are lodged in the Earthly Palace—whose merit is slight and virtue meager, and who have not yet been granted return—shall all, in accordance with the talismanic commands of the Lady of Blue, be led by their respective overseers, consoled, sustained, and protected, so that none may be disturbed, and all may be restored to rebirth among humankind.\n\nAt that moment, the great sagely hosts of the heavens, the Boundless Most High Great Dao Sovereign, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Flying Celestial Kings, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Longevity Marshal, the True Lord of Compassionate Life, the various Primordial Ladies and Numinous Consorts, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the various Perfected Ones, and the seven thousand two hundred and forty divine youths simultaneously snapped their fingers, universally proclaiming to all heavens, earths, and waters; the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the jade pivot and celestial balance; the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts; the various numinous mountains and earthly bureaus; the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus; the twelve river sources; the Cavernous Ultimate and Cavernous Abyss; all without height or depth, near or far, boundary or limit, great or small, end or extremity—every spirit was made to hear and know.\n\nThe golden tally and jade writ were entrusted to the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, with the charge that henceforth all would be renewed, reverently upholding the great Dharma without partiality. Though the great cycles of heaven and earth have turned, the orthodox writ remains luminously clear. Now, in accordance with the ancient canon of the Upper Palace of the Lady of Blue, the sagely Dao is reaffirmed.\n\nFor the pure and faithful disciple, male or female, of such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, named Wang Jia, aged so-and-so years, whose natal destiny is bing-wu, whose register is held by the Red Emperor, who received qi in the seventh month, and who is endowed with yang from the Cinnabar Heaven—though his prior merit remains unfulfilled, and he dwells in this defiled world, tainted by its impurities—he is fated to perish, his life entrusted to the Great Yin, his form lodged in the Earthly Bureau. Now, in the central heaven, within such-and-such a village and hamlet, a chamber has been established in the Pacifying Palace as his dwelling. Yet his merit is slight and virtue meager, and he cannot return of his own accord. Now, driven and pressed by the Earthly Bureau, he finds no peace; his hun-soul flees, his po-soul scatters, and his corpse knows no rest.\n\nRespectfully following the golden tally and jade writ of the Illuminated Perfection’s great Dharma, we now reverently invoke the natural jade writ talismanic commands of the Lady of Blue, petitioning them to descend and instruct the numinous officials of the nine earths within such-and-such a heaven to pacify and secure Wang Jia’s bodily form and earthly abode.\n\nWe invoke the descent of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Granary Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones, accompanied by the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount, riding nine thousand myriad chariots of Granary Dragons, bearing the Nine Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Azure Emperor and Lady of Blue. They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the eastern region, opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells, to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit, returning them to his former abode. Those who should be transformed shall be transformed; those who should be delivered shall be delivered; those who should be reborn shall be reborn; those who should return shall return. Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated, sustained and protected, so that none may be disturbed.\n\nIn accordance with the writ of the Lady of Blue, offer azure-textured silk ninety feet, or nine feet, to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords as a token of deliverance.\n\nWe further invoke the descent of the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven’s Vermilion Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones, accompanied by the immortals of the Southern Marchmount, riding three thousand myriad chariots of Vermilion Dragons, bearing the Three Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Red Emperor and Lady of Blue. They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the southern region, opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells, to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit, returning them to his former abode. Those who should be transformed shall be transformed; those who should be delivered shall be delivered; those who should be reborn shall be reborn; those who should return shall return. Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated, sustained and protected, so that none may be disturbed.\n\nAs in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,\nwith crimson-scripted silk eighty feet in length—or eight feet—offered to the Lords of the Three Qi,\nas a token of deliverance.\nAgain, invoke the descent of the Yellow Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Sovereign of the One Qi, Yellow Heaven,\naccompanied by the immortals of the Central Marchmount,\nriding twelve thousand chariots of Yellow Dragons,\nbearing the One Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Yellow Emperor and Lady Blue.\nThey descend to the limitless, boundless, measureless, depthless, fathomless, endless Earthly Bureau of the Central Realm and all its numinous officials,\nopening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,\nto rescue Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,\nreturning them to his former abode.\nThose who should be transformed shall be transformed;\nthose who should be delivered shall be delivered;\nthose who should be reborn shall be reborn;\nthose who should return shall return.\nThose not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,\nsustained and protected,\nso that none may be disturbed.\n\nAs in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,\nwith yellow-scripted silk one hundred twenty feet in length—or twelve feet—offered to the Lord of the One Qi,\nas a token of deliverance.\nAgain, invoke the descent of the White Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones of the Seven Qi, White Heaven,\naccompanied by the immortals of the Western Marchmount,\nriding seventy million chariots of White Dragons,\nbearing the Seven Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the White Emperor and Lady Blue.\nThey descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the western region,\nopening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,\nto extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,\nreturning them to his former abode.\nThose who should be transformed shall be transformed;\nthose who should be delivered shall be delivered;\nthose who should be reborn shall be reborn;\nthose who should return shall return.\nThose not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,\nsustained and protected,\nso that none may be disturbed.\n\nAs in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,\nwith black-scripted silk fifty feet in length—or five feet—offered to the Lords of the Five Qi,\nas a token of deliverance.\nAgain, invoke the descent of the Dark Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones of the Five Qi, Dark Heaven,\naccompanied by the immortals of the Northern Marchmount,\nriding fifty million chariots of Dark Dragons,\nbearing the Five Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Black Emperor and Lady Blue.\nThey descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the northern region,\nopening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,\nto extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,\nreturning them to his former abode.\nThose who should be transformed shall be transformed;\nthose who should be delivered shall be delivered;\nthose who should be reborn shall be reborn;\nthose who should return shall return.\nThose not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,\nsustained and protected,\nso that none may be disturbed.\n\nFurther, with five taels of gold—or fifty catties of iron—offered to the Five Emperors,\nto pacify and secure the Five Directions.\nWang Jia now falls within the precedent of deliverance:\nthe earthly officials of the nine lands shall each attend to their jurisdictions,\nproviding sustenance and protection,\nensuring the stability of his form and the guardianship of his spirit,\nso that his po-soul shall not scatter.\nThey shall await the completion of the ritual,\nwhen he shall return to his former abode,\ncross the ford and be reborn.\nMay the Five Emperors nourish him with the sweetness of Grand Harmony’s primordial essence,\nguide his qi and nurture his spirit,\nimbue him with the Three Luminaries,\ninfuse him with the dark flow of the vast source,\nso that jade mushrooms spontaneously flourish within him,\nhis radiance soon gleams,\nhis sweet dew soon fragrances,\nhis hun-soul ascends to the Upper Clarity,\nhis clothing and sustenance arise naturally,\nand he descends to dwell in his palace,\nunited with the light,\nnever again parted from it,\ntogether receiving transformation and rebirth.\n\nToday is a day of great celebration,\nwhen the deliverance of beings is measureless.\nAll within the Earthly Bureau shall comply,\nreverently upholding the ancient statutes,\nand inscribing their merit across the heavens.\nThose who defy the *Scripture of Lady Blue*\nshall have their offices abolished and their forms punished,\nas clearly stipulated in the old regulations,\nwith golden dragons hastening the decree.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your consideration,\nawaiting your response.\nYour servant, Wang Jia, prostrates himself in awe and dread,\nbowing twice in reverence to report.\nYour servant, [Name], of [Prefecture], [County], [Township], [Village].\n\nSupreme, supreme, supreme—One Qi, One Qi!\nSupreme, supreme, supreme—boundless, without summit,\nwithout color, without light,\nvast and transcendent, the Perfected of the Great Dao,\nthe Primordial Celestial Worthy,\nthe Thirty-Two Emperors,\nthe Most High Lord of the Great Dao,\nHis August Jade Majesty of the Grand Clarity.\n\nIn the year [X] of the Great Era, the [X] month, the first day of the [X] month, at the [X] hour,\nat [Prefecture], [County], [Township], [Village],\na memorial on yellow silk,\npresented via golden dragon.\n\nAccording to the ancient canons of *Lady Blue*,\nthis text is inscribed in vermilion on yellow silk.\nThe master, at the place where the deceased lies,\nat the hour of the rat, facing north,\nburns five incense fires,\nperforms the Five Pacifications,\nand presents the yellow silk memorial.\nThe text is exposed to the open air for one night;\nat dawn the following day,\nit is buried in the corresponding direction,\nto pacify the spirits and stabilize the form.\n\nFor those who perform this rite,\nthe *Scripture of Lady Blue* states:\nthe nine generations of ancestral souls in the Long Night\nshall all emerge into the light,\ntheir names recorded in the Heavenly Register,\ntheir offenses expunged by the Three Officials,\nand after thirty-two years,\nthey shall regain their former forms and be reborn.\nFor those not yet reborn,\ntheir remains in the former abode shall be guarded by the Five Emperors,\nprotected by the earthly deities,\ncomforted and sustained,\nso that none may be disturbed.\nWithin a hundred years,\nnone shall fail to be transformed and restored to the human realm.\n\nThe ledgers of the Three Realms are most precise:\nthe wise discern their profound principles,\nexamining good and evil,\nkarma and retribution,\nknowing these words are not empty.\nThe foolish submit to fate,\ndenying their truth—\nhow pitiable their suffering in the Three Officials’ burning charcoal!\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nIn the era of Red Clarity,\nthere was a Daoist named Zheng Ren’an,\nwhose merit was incomplete when he died in the northern wastes of Mount Chang.\nHis son, Zhongming,\nstudied under Master Xuanhe\nand used this text to pacify Ren’an’s remains in his palace for thirty years.\nRen’an was delivered and destined to return to the human realm,\nbut his body was burned by barbarians.\nHis form arose in dark majesty,\nand he now serves as the Elder Lord of the Southern Palace.\nThe traces of his attainment are inscribed in the Southern Pavilion of the Supreme Ultimate,\nmost clearly recorded.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nIn the kingdom of Shànrěn,\nthere was a Daoist named Xian Xinran,\nwho studied under the Eternal Youth\nand received the transmission of the *Lingbao Scripture of Extinction and Ascension*.\nHis merit incomplete,\nhe died in the Heaven of Azure Origin,\nhis remains interred in the Land of Flowing Life.\nThe Eternal Youth used this text to pacify his form,\nand after a hundred years,\nwhen a great flood swept it away,\nhe was transformed and reborn.\nHe now bears the title of Elder Lord of Primordial Numinosity.\n\nIn the Southern Palace, his Daoist traces are recorded in the Purple Tenuity’s Hall.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nIn the world of Abandoned Worthiness, there was a Daoist surnamed Hào, styled Fūmíng. From youth, he loved mountains and rivers, abandoned his home to study afar, but his merit unfulfilled, he died beneath the Earth-Mirror Mountain. His son, Shàoxìn, sought the Northern Outer Master and received this text to pacify the form of Fūmíng’s corpse. After seven hundred years of refinement by water and fire, he was restored to life among men. Later, he studied under Master Black Text and received the transmission of ascension to heaven. He now serves as the Elder Lord of the Mysterious.\n\nIn the Southern Palace, his Daoist traces are recorded in the Northern Origin’s Mysterious Window.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nIn the Southern Pear World of the Middle Origin Heaven, there was a Daoist surnamed Wáng, styled Dùmíng. From youth, he traveled to study and received from Master Tú the True the transmission of the *Five Chapters on Ascending as an Immortal*. His merit incomplete, he died in the eastern mountains’ broad and numinous vale. His son, Jǐngxiù, sought Master Dài Zhòngjūn and received this text to pacify his corpse. After ninety years, when the eastern mountains suffered great famine and people dug the earth for food, they unearthed his corpse, and he was immediately transformed and reborn. Later, his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven and became the Perfected of the Scenic Empyrean.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nAll these gentlemen accumulated learning and neared extinction, their Daoist work nearly complete, when they received this text and were restored to life among men. All transcended the void, stepped through the emptiness, ascended to the Golden Gates, and received titles by nature.\n\nTheir deeds stretch far into the distant past, beyond the understanding of common men. Examining those closer to our time: Master Yǎnmén studied under Night Radiance, Master Gāoqiū studied under Master Stone, and Master Hóngyá studied under the Metal Mother. All received the *Lingbao Scripture of Extinction and the Five Refinements* and the transmission of ascension to heaven.\n\nMaster Yǎnmén died in Chángqiū Mountain of Lù County in Yúyáng. Master Gāoqiū died in Gāofù Mountain of Wénxǐ County in Zhōngshān. Master Hóngyá died in Làng Mountain of Gūzāng County in Wǔwēi. All received this text to pacify their tombs.\n\nAfter several decades, Master Yǎnmén’s tomb collapsed, and his form transformed. Later, he entered the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Méng and received the scriptures, becoming a Minister of Immortals. After seventy-two years, Master Gāoqiū’s tomb collapsed and was opened by men. His coffin was raised, and his form took flight. He now serves as the Perfected of the Central Marchmount. After one hundred twenty years, Master Hóngyá’s tomb opened, and his corpse’s form soared aloft. He received the scriptures and became the Perfected of Green City.\n\nAll these worthies received the method of extinction, the transmission of ascension, and the Dao of pacifying the numinous. Thus, they ascended the lofty void, soared through the high clouds, roamed in leisure through the Purple Tenuity, and received the title of Perfected.\n\nThese recent events are no longer distant transmissions. The Heavenly King of the Primordial Beginning now reveals the treasure store of the Primordial Beginning to the Supreme Ultimate’s Transcendents. Those who encounter it will transcend ten thousand kalpas of past lives, their names recorded in the Upper Clarity, and they shall attain the Dao of immortality.\n\nO men and women of the heavens, how can you fail to heed the decree of the *Nüqīng*? Treasure and guard it in secret.\n\n*Wondrous Scripture of the Five Refinements for Extinction and the Revivification of the Corpse from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll the Lower.\n\nThe following is based on variant readings from S.298: \"prefecture and village\" instead of \"village.\" The character \"青\" is supplied from S.298.

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*. Originally in one scroll, now rearranged into two. The base text of the upper scroll derives from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Washing Mystery Section, Original Texts Category); collated with Dunhuang manuscript P.2865 (first half). The base text of the lower scroll is Dunhuang manuscript P.2865 (second half); collated with Dunhuang manuscript S.298.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life, Scroll One**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Ever-Joyful Abode, instructing seven thousand two hundred and forty youths. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the youths of superior wisdom and the Wheel-Turning Celestial Youths advanced, made obeisance, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Today, as we attend your seat, our joy is beyond measure. The heavens have opened their grace, and all is radiant with light. The dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits—all have been liberated and restored to blessedness. The Three Offices have ceased their accusations, and the living and the dead rejoice together.\n\nYet the souls of the departed, though freed, have not yet entered the Wheel of Rebirth. Their corporeal spirits scatter and fall, their rotting bones devoid of moisture, sinking into the ninefold earth, strewn across the subterranean bureaus. Their wandering souls drift in anguish, unable to return. The Earthly Offices press for reckoning, their bodily forms restless, enduring renewed sorrow and oppression, gazing upward to implore the heavens.\n\nNow that grace has been extended and all is made anew, the August Dao flows freely, its blessings reaching the ten directions. We have heard that the Heavenly Worthy has bestowed great compassion; we pray that the August Mercy be universally applied. Grant that those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be born be born, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should return be returned. If their karmic bonds are not yet severed and they cannot return, their bodily forms remain in their former abodes, concealed in the nine springs. Harassed by myriad spirits, they find no refuge, their wandering souls adrift, returning to afflict their descendants.\n\nSince the Great Transformation has arisen, it is fitting that all be universally absolved. We do not know if there are further essential methods within the Dharma that may be proclaimed, to be announced to the Earthly Offices, so that they may pacify, console, and shelter them, allowing all to find peace. Let the nine bureaus be duly distinguished, and their bodies guarded and tended. If you deign to show compassion, then all under heaven will rejoice in harmony, the living and the dead bearing no resentment, and blessings will flow for a hundred million kalpas, endless through the ages.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy universally commanded the Heavenly Thearchs, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Great Sage Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Flying Celestial Divine Kings, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Southern Supreme Life-Nurturing and World-Delivering Sima, the Recorders of Deeds and Lords of Destiny, the Perfected Ones of Longevity, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the various Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts—all to resume their seats. \"Now I shall further expound the Dharma gates for the youths of superior wisdom, clarifying the ancient canons of the Dragon Han and Mystic Capital, the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms* and the *Scripture of the Maiden of Azure Jade*, to deliver the dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits, that all may behold the light.\n\nProclaim to the heavens, that each may elucidate the spontaneous jade scripts of their celestial names. Universally announce to the celestial and terrestrial water bureaus, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Three Realms and Five Thearchs, the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks, the earthly officials of the nine lands, the Caverns of Primordial, Abyssal, Void, Numinous, and Non-Being, the Limitless and Boundless, the measureless heights and depths, the formless and colorless, the soundless and silent, the immeasurably vast and minute—all spirits and numina, each according to their appointed tasks.\n\nNow, for those under your jurisdiction—those souls condemned for past transgressions—record their good and evil deeds, merits and faults, years, months, and days. Itemize each matter, distinguish their former abodes and the whereabouts of their bodily forms, and according to their respective domains, console and shelter them. Let the earthly deities guard and protect them, tend and provide for them, allowing no disturbance, so that they may achieve fruition according to their merits. Let those who should be transferred be transferred, those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should be born be born. Let the records of the fallen be reviewed, the vows of the waters absolved, the celestial decrees of punishment erased, and all be made manifest.\"\n\nThereupon, the assembly of the fourfold host and the youths of superior wisdom rejoiced, made obeisance, and simultaneously raised their hands, snapping their fingers in praise.\n\nAt that moment, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs took their seats and commanded the Flying Celestial Divine Beings to unfurl the Purple Yang Jade Terrace, open the Luminous True Jade Casket, and retrieve the celestial, spontaneously arisen jade scriptures of the *Infinite Cavern Chapters* from the Heavenly Center.

His son, Shàoxìn, sought the Northern Outer Master and received this text to pacify the form of Fūmíng’s corpse. After seven hundred years of refinement by water and fire, he was restored to life among men. Later, he studied under Master Black Text and received the transmission of ascension to heaven. He now serves as the Elder Lord of the Mysterious.\n\nIn the Southern Palace, his Daoist traces are recorded in the Northern Origin’s Mysterious Window.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nIn the Southern Pear World of the Middle Origin Heaven, there was a Daoist surnamed Wáng, styled Dùmíng. From youth, he traveled to study and received from Master Tú the True the transmission of the *Five Chapters on Ascending as an Immortal*. His merit incomplete, he died in the eastern mountains’ broad and numinous vale. His son, Jǐngxiù, sought Master Dài Zhòngjūn and received this text to pacify his corpse. After ninety years, when the eastern mountains suffered great famine and people dug the earth for food, they unearthed his corpse, and he was immediately transformed and reborn. Later, his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven and became the Perfected of the Scenic Empyrean.\n\nThe Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:\nAll these gentlemen accumulated learning and neared extinction, their Daoist work nearly complete, when they received this text and were restored to life among men. All transcended the void, stepped through the emptiness, ascended to the Golden Gates, and received titles by nature.\n\nTheir deeds stretch far into the distant past, beyond the understanding of common men. Examining those closer to our time: Master Yǎnmén studied under Night Radiance, Master Gāoqiū studied under Master Stone, and Master Hóngyá studied under the Metal Mother. All received the *Lingbao Scripture of Extinction and the Five Refinements* and the transmission of ascension to heaven.\n\nMaster Yǎnmén died in Chángqiū Mountain of Lù County in Yúyáng. Master Gāoqiū died in Gāofù Mountain of Wénxǐ County in Zhōngshān. Master Hóngyá died in Làng Mountain of Gūzāng County in Wǔwēi. All received this text to pacify their tombs.\n\nAfter several decades, Master Yǎnmén’s tomb collapsed, and his form transformed. Later, he entered the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Méng and received the scriptures, becoming a Minister of Immortals. After seventy-two years, Master Gāoqiū’s tomb collapsed and was opened by men. His coffin was raised, and his form took flight. He now serves as the Perfected of the Central Marchmount. After one hundred twenty years, Master Hóngyá’s tomb opened, and his corpse’s form soared aloft. He received the scriptures and became the Perfected of Green City.\n\nAll these worthies received the method of extinction, the transmission of ascension, and the Dao of pacifying the numinous. Thus, they ascended the lofty void, soared through the high clouds, roamed in leisure through the Purple Tenuity, and received the title of Perfected.\n\nThese recent events are no longer distant transmissions. The Heavenly King of the Primordial Beginning now reveals the treasure store of the Primordial Beginning to the Supreme Ultimate’s Transcendents.
