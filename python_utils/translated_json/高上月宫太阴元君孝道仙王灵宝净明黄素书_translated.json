Essence*\n*(Commonly abbreviated as the *Scripture of Pure Clarity and Yellow Essence*)*\n\n**Author Unknown**, a Daoist scripture of the *Pure Clarity* sect from the Song-Yuan period.\nCommentary by *Fei Fei* (傅飞), a Yuan-era transmission.\nTen volumes.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongxuan* (Mystic Primordial) section, *Methods* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Highest Celestial Palace of the Moon, Supreme Dark Lord of Filial Dao, the Soul-Treasuring Immortal King’s Scripture of Pure Clarity and Yellow Essence***\n\nThe Preface states:\n\nThe **Supreme Ultimate**—the loftiest origin—is the **Azure Heaven** of the first beginning.\nIt lies **five thousand li** beyond the palaces of the Sun and Moon,\nwhere the **divine mechanisms** of the Dao unfold in radiant distinction,\nyet remain difficult to discern.\n\nDoes Heaven’s Way return?\nThis is the **dim and silent void**, beyond naming.\n\nWhen the **Imperial Sovereign** issues the **Shocking** (震),\nit is called the **Azure Heaven** of the first beginning.\nHeaven’s creation was yet in **primordial chaos**,\nbefore the Five Phases had fully manifested—\nit could not yet be seen.\n\nThus it is said: **\"Five thousand li beyond the palaces of the Sun and Moon.\"**\n\nThe **pure essence of the Sun** is the **Supreme Yang**,\nthe **pure essence of the Moon** is the **Supreme Yin**—\nthis interplay of **Yin and Yang** is the **Dao**.\n\nIts waxing and waning have their seasons,\nits swiftness and slowness follow their measures.\nThe **divine mechanisms** operate under the **unfathomable governance of Yin and Yang**.\nThus it is said: **\"The divisions are manifest, yet not easily distinguished.\"**\n\nThe **Celestial Sovereign**, moved by pity for the **premature deaths** of living beings,\nsummoned the **Two Celestial Lords of the Sun and Moon Palaces**\nto expound the **Four Great Methods**:\nthe **Soul-Treasuring Method (灵宝大法)**,\nthe **Yellow Essence Method (黄素法)**,\nthe **Pure Clarity Method (净明法)**,\nand the **Method of Salvation (度人法)**—\neach one in turn.\n\nWhen **Heaven and Earth bind and restrain**,\nall things refine into **purity**.\nWhen **male and female merge their essences**,\nall things generate anew—\nnone of this is without the **collision and transformation of Yin and Yang qi**.\n\nYet when **internal injury** strikes the **Seven Essences**,\nand **external malevolence** assaults the **Six Qi**,\nthen the **plagues of Yin and Yang** take hold,\nand living beings suffer the **misery of untimely death**.\n\nThus the **Celestial Sovereign** summoned the **Two Celestial Officials of the Sun and Moon**,\ndeclaring that **only the most refined essence of Yin and Yang qi**\ncould **revive the dying, restore the fallen, and reanimate the stiffened**—\ngranting them **full years of life** and **eternal longevity**.\n\nYet among these, the **Soul-Treasuring Method** is the **root of the Dao**,\nthe **Yellow Essence Method** is the **repository of life**,\nthe **Pure Clarity Method** is the **source of innate nature**,\nand the **Method of Salvation** is the **gateway to the Dao**.\n\nThe **Dao descends in its proper order**—\nthus it is taught.\n\nWhen the **Law** was expounded,\nthe **multitude of True Ones** gathered in assembly.\n\nThe **Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Celestial King**, ascended to the **Hall of the Penetrating Spirit**, seated upon the **Jade Pivot Throne**, and reverently imparted this scripture.\n\nSome may be lost in **delusion**, squandering the **true for the false**.\nYet return to the **original source**, and the **true abides eternally**—\nthus the **multitude of True Ones** gathered in assembly.\n\nFor there exists a **True Sovereign**—\nthe **Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Celestial King**, is He.\n\n**Penetrating** like water’s depth, reaching all things,\n**Spiritual** like fire’s transmission, responding to all things.\nAscending to the **Hall of the Penetrating Spirit**,\nseated, the **transformations of Dao-Law** become boundless.\nSeated upon the **Jade Pivot Throne**,\nthe **pure Yang essence** is refined and given form.\nReverently imparting this scripture—\nhow could one dare neglect it?\n\nIts text is **broad as a yard**,\nyet this book shines with **intermingled Yellow and White Essences**,\nits radiant bristles dazzling,\nilluminating the **Moon Palace**.\n\nThus it was entrusted to him,\nand he was named **Moon Palace’s Supreme Sovereign of the Great Yin,\nPious Dao King of the Soul-Treasuring, Pure Clarity, Yellow Essence**.\n\nWhile the **Pure Clarity Soul-Treasuring Method** was entrusted to the **Sun Palace’s Supreme Sovereign of the Great Yang,\nPious Dao King of the Bright Sovereign, Soul-Treasuring, Pure Clarity**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Things intermingle, hence called **pattern (wen)**.\"*\nThe **qi of Yin-Yang, firm and yielding**, intertwines to form **pattern**,\nand thus the **heavens and earth revolve in cycles**.\nHence its text is **broad and long, a yard in measure**—\n**yellow earth in hue**, governed by the **spleen**.\n**White**, the color of **metal and water**, governed by the **kidneys**.\nAt the **receipt of life’s mandate**, the **spleen and kidneys** are the **root of original qi and penetrating qi**.\nWhile the **fetus nurtures within the womb**, it depends upon the mother’s body.\nThus the **intermingled Yellow and White Essences** radiate,\nilluminating the **Moon Palace**.\nYet when **inherited nature is perfected**,\nit rests upon the **father’s essence**.\nThe **Pure Clarity Treasure Method** belongs to the **Sun Palace’s Great Yang**.\n\nThese two scriptures are **profound and subtle**, beyond comprehension.\nThey can **reward sovereigns and parents**,\ncan **forge the Great Elixir**,\ncan **subdue calamities and demons**.\nThose who **behold them** dissolve stagnation,\nthose who **hear them** are cured of illness,\nthose who **carry them** attain longevity.\n\nThe *Cold Clarity Yellow Essence Scripture*—\nits **principles are subtle**, its **Dao concise**, its **meaning profound and difficult to fathom**.\nFor the **inner** is the **mirror of the outer**,\nand **one body** is the **embodiment of heaven and earth’s reverence**.\n\n「When the **Heavenly Sovereign** aligns with the **spirit**,\nand the mind extends it outward,\nthen **loyalty and filial piety** can repay **sovereigns and parents**.\nTo **extract lead and mercury**,\nto **refine water and fire**,\nand to **verify them externally**,\nthen **alchemy** can be achieved.\n\nMedicine forged by **fire** is the **reversal of qi**.\nYet this **guides the common spirits**—the **perverse qi** of demons.\nAnd this **restores the upright stagnation**—the **suppressed qi** of calamities.\nHence, those who **behold the flowing qi** dissolve their afflictions,\nfor **excessive qi** is their undoing—thus, those who **hear the central qi** are cured.\n\nAs for those who **guard the primordial qi** without loss,\neven if they endure with **heaven and earth** as eternal companions,\nit can be done.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who carry it attain longevity.\"*\nThose who **grasp its meaning** achieve **transcendence**.\n\n**Embracing the harmonious transformations of yin and yang**,\n**illuminating the celestial movements of stars and constellations**—\nthe **Four Turnings of the Northern Dipper**,\nthe **Eastern and Western divisions** governing the **cosmic axis**.\n**Qi’s responses and interactions**,\nthe **early and late** separations of **cosmic candidates**.\nNone but those who have already **obtained the Pure Clarity Treasure Method**\ncan easily comprehend this.\n\nThe **transformations of yin and yang** are **activated by qi’s resonance**.\nThe **Four Turnings of the Northern Dipper** revolve **by the void’s operation**.\nThe **eastern and western divisions** govern the **cosmic axis by qi’s penetration**.\n**Unfolding and extending it**,\nit **spans the ages without end**.\n**Condensing and gathering it**,\nit **shortens the years to mere moments**.\nNone but those who **exhaust the principles and perfect their nature**\ncan truly partake in this.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Without the responses of cosmic candidates,\nand the early and late separations,\nnone but those who have already obtained the Pure Clarity Treasure Method\ncan easily comprehend this.\"*\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor’s Essence Scripture on Human Dao** states:\n*\"All who study the **Yellow Essence Scripture**,\nby **aligning the Five Qi with the Primordial**,\nand **converging the Three Yang at the Vertex**,\nmay either **ascend to sainthood** or **transcend to transcendence**.\nThe **young**, with **thousand-day devotion**, may achieve greatness.\nThe **middle-aged**, with **thousand-day cultivation**, may still attain fulfillment.\nThe **elderly**, with **thousand-day perseverance**, may yet establish merit.\nAll disciples, once **obtaining the method**,\nshould **treasure the fleeting moments of day and month**,\nforging **longevity’s foundation**—none surpass this in enduring calculation.*\n\nAt **human birth**, the **primordial qi** resides at the **navel**.\nYet the **Five Phases’ qi** disperse through the **five viscera**.\n**Governed by the Three Palaces**,\nthey are the **Elixir Field**, the **Crimson Palace**, and the **Mud Pellet**.\n\nMortals, **lost in desires**, fail to **gather and preserve**,\nthus their **Five Qi scatter**, and their **primordial qi perishes**.\n**Ascension and descent misalign**,\nand the **Three Palaces are obstructed**.\n**Refinement and dissipation exhaust**,\nso **premature death** ensues.\n\nStudying the **Yellow Essence Scripture**,\none must **direct the Five Qi to the Primordial**,\nso that the **Golden Elixir** is perfected.\nAnd **converge the Three Yang at the Vertex**,\nfilling the **Marrow Sea** with abundance.\nSome **ascend in spirit**, their **vital functions unbounded**,\nand **enter sainthood**.\nOthers **shed their mortal shells**, **resolving the corpse**,\n**transcending the dusty net**,\nand **ascend to transcendence**.\n\nThe **young**, with **qi and blood firm and intact**,\nif they **proceed steadily**, may achieve greatness.\nThe **middle-aged**, with **qi and blood diminished**,\nif they **act with vigor**, may still attain fulfillment.\nThe **elderly**, with **qi and blood decayed**,\nif they **strive with strength**, may yet establish merit.\nIt requires **thousand days’ duration**,\nfor **numbers begin at one**,\n**stand at two**,\nand **complete at three**.\n**Accumulated over three years**,\nthey **span the times** and achieve **fullness of numbers**—\nthus their success is ensured.\nLearners who **realize the swiftness of sun and moon**,\nand **know the fleeting nature of each moment**,\nshould **devote their efforts here**.\n\nAll who study the **Yellow Essence Scripture** must **prioritize loyalty and filial piety**.\nThe **loyal and filial**,\nwith **upright and honest hearts**,\n**bearing qi that is temperate and respectful**,\ncannot be swayed by **right and wrong**—\n**perverse desires** cannot enter them.\n**Ten Virtues are complete**,\n**Five Transgressions are dissolved**,\nand within their **single heart**,\n**external defilements** cannot **disturb**—\nnaturally, they **achieve perfection**, and **ultimately succeed**.\nThus, the **adepts of the Yellow Essence** regard **loyalty and filial piety** as their foundation.\n\nMoreover, the **loyal and filial**,\n**serving their parents internally**,\n**serving their sovereigns externally**,\nwith **no guilt nor fear**,\ncan **reach the profound and bright**.\nTheir **names and deeds** are **recorded**,\ntheir **merits at the Elixir Platform** are **preserved in the Purple Register**.\nCoupled with **Daoist study**,\nthey are **like fine gold meeting the forge**,\nor **jewel meeting the chisel**—\nfew are those who, **already carved**, fail to become **vessels of excellence**.\n\n**Loyalty and filial piety** derive their names\nfrom **serving sovereigns and parents**,\nall **resting upon upright hearts**, **honest judgments**, **bearing temperate qi**, and **respectful demeanor**.\nYet in **serving the public**,\n**honest judgment** is paramount.\nIn **serving one’s parents**,\n**respectful demeanor** is paramount.\n**Honest judgment** brings **clarity**—\nthus **right and wrong** cannot sway them.\n**Respectful demeanor** fosters **abundance**—\nthus **perverse desires** cannot enter them.\nFrom **loyalty and filial piety**, they **extend outward**:\n**Wealth** becomes **generosity**.\n**Speech** becomes **caution**.\n**Dwelling** is **spacious and tolerant**.\n**Conduct** is **regulated by ritual**.\n**Words** are **sincere in truth**.\nThus the **Ten Virtues are complete**.\n\n**Sovereign and subject** uphold **justice**—\ndo not **reverse the cosmic order**.\n**Parent and child** share **affection**—\ndo not **reverse their natural divisions**.\n**Husband and wife** observe **distinctions**—\ndo not **reverse their harmonious accord**.\n**Elders and juniors** follow **sequence**—\ndo not **reverse their ritual precedence**.\n**Friends** keep **trust**—\ndo not **reverse their hearts of communion**.\nThus the **Five Transgressions are dissolved**.\n\nWith **one heart pure and serene**,\nlike **water clarified and clean**,\nhow can **external filth** **disturb** it?\nThen, in **Daoist study**, can there be any **failure**?\n\nThe *Scripture on Guiding Others* says:\n*\"All heavens record human deeds of virtue and vice,\nwithout the slightest loss.\nWhen the **Ten Virtues are complete**,\nand the **Five Transgressions are dissolved**,\nthen the **register of evils** has no names,\nand the **register of merits** is fully inscribed.\nThe **Purple Register** of the **Elixir Platform**—\nwhat more need be doubted?\"*\n\n*The Rites* say:\n*\"Jade unpolished does not become a vessel.\nHumans unlearned do not know the Dao.\"*\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"If gold is in the crucible,\nonly the smith can cast it.\nWith **inner conduct refined**,\nand **Daoist study added**,\nis it not like fine gold and precious jade—\n**polished to enhance their utility**,\n**carved to perfect their beauty**?\n**Dryfowl and Hu Lian**—\nwho would say such vessels are **difficult to forge**?\"*\n\n「Now, the disciples may be divided into those who enter public office, those who serve the people while in office, those whose parents are both alive and honored, those who have lost both parents, and those who are the sole support of their parents yet face partiality. When reflecting on their past, they must carefully examine their intentions.\n\nThose who tread the path of public service must understand the true purpose of their office.\nThose who wield the people’s strength must know the proper way to serve them.\nThose who have living parents must recognize that the debt of filial piety cannot be repaid with tears, nor can the dead be consoled with lamentations.\nOnly those who have lost both parents know the unbearable weight of grief.\nYet if they can grasp that those who turn toward the Dao will succeed, transcending worldly records and rising above ordinary status, their teachings will be universally followed. Extend this to the world, and there will be none who cannot be reached.\n\nThe loyal will revere it to its utmost; the filial will follow it to its utmost. If one embodies both reverence and filial duty without failing, then those in public service will labor night and day without rest to serve their superiors, and with kindness and benevolence to nurture those beneath them—thus knowing the true purpose of their office.\n\nBy following the Dao of Heaven, sharing the benefits of Earth, moderating oneself and regulating expenditures, and remembering one’s sovereign and parents, one knows the proper way to serve the people.\nThe body, flesh, and bones are received from one’s parents, and the debt of gratitude is boundless as the sky. Filial children cherish each day because they fear failing to repay this debt, even in death.\nWithout a father, where would one find refuge?\nWithout a mother, where would one find support?\nWhen leaving home, they must protect against cold and heat;\nWhen returning, they must guard against harm.\nThose who, after joy, fear what follows—\nthis is the sorrow of remembering the dead.\n\n*The Classic of Filial Piety* says:\n*\"To establish oneself in the Dao and act accordingly, to earn a name in future generations, and to honor one’s parents—this is the ultimate expression of filial piety. But if one can turn toward the Dao, succeed in its practice, transcend worldly bonds, escape the cycles of fate, attain extraordinary status, and be ranked among the immortals, then what greater fulfillment of filial duty could there be?\"*\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White* must prioritize **frugality and caution**.\nThe frugal and cautious have no greed or desire, yet maintain steadfast principles.\nWithout greed or desire, one naturally upholds virtue.\nWith virtue upheld, there is no shame or defilement.\nWithout anger or agitation, one avoids suffering.\nWithout suffering, one can practice the Dao.\nOnce the Dao is practiced, one naturally becomes expansive and tolerant.\nIn ease, in stillness, in emptiness, in tranquility, in longevity, in constancy—\nonly then can success be achieved.\n\nThe contented see gain and ponder justice, thus having no greed.\nThe cautious speak and act without recklessness, thus maintaining virtue.\nGreed is enticed by external things;\nvirtue is rooted in the self.\nInteraction with others may lead to conflict,\nand daily battles of the mind can never be won by clinging to the form.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Without greed, one naturally upholds virtue.\nWith virtue upheld, there is no shame.\"*\n\nThose who indulge in drink and force themselves to drink cannot escape **drunken excess**.\nThose who dwell in damp, low places cannot avoid **moisture’s harm**.\nThus, with virtue upheld, there is no shame.\n\nIf three calls go unheeded, one must resort to harsh words.\nIf strictness is pushed too far, one will inevitably harbor resentment.\nThus, without shame, one avoids anger.\n\nWhen profit and harm clash, flames arise abundantly,\nand common folk are consumed by them.\nThus, without anger, one avoids suffering.\n\nThe serene and effortless are the foundation of **Daoist virtue**.\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* must focus on harmonizing their nature.\nThe nature’s operation mirrors still water:\nlike its reflections, it accepts all without favor,\nyet cannot distinguish right from wrong.\nAct when necessary, rest when necessary—\nto follow this naturally is to grasp its essence.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they understand the principles of conduct, must also learn to guard them.\nThe method of guarding lies in contemplating:\nwhere did this body originate?\nWhere will it return?\nWithin this coming and going,\nif one recognizes its source,\none will naturally attain **spiritual insight**—\nand thus the Dao of the immortals will be fulfilled.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they understand the origin and return, must strive with determination.\nStriving is not difficult,\nbut preserving constancy is.\nWhat is meant by the difficulty of preserving constancy?\nWhen food and clothing press in, greed follows—**this is the first**.\nWhen superiors impose restraints, worldly affairs swirl around—**this is the second**.\nWhen children and spouse entangle one, worries and calculations arise—**this is the third**.\nWhen fame and gain ensnare one, they refuse to let go—**this is the fourth**.\nWhen illness torments one, their practice remains incomplete—**this is the fifth**.\nWhen teachers are chosen carelessly, their methods are not properly absorbed—**this is the sixth**.\nWhen debates arise, doubts multiply, and one cannot remain focused—**this is the seventh**.\nWhen resolve wavers, diligence fades, and one forgets their initial efforts—**this is the eighth**.\nWhen time slips away, success cannot be achieved—**this is the ninth**.\nAll these circumstances lead to **deviation from the Dao**.\n\nWhen encountering such trials, one must persist with effort, seeking not immediate gratification, but ultimate fulfillment—\nthen success will be attained.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, once they grasp the way of constancy, must also know the methods of attainment.\nWhat is meant by attainment?\nTo know Heaven and Earth,\nto know the Four Seasons,\nto know the Sun and Moon,\nto know the Five Phases,\nto distinguish Water and Fire,\nto harmonize Dragon and Tiger,\nto understand alchemical medicines,\nto master lead and mercury,\nand to perfect the techniques of **distillation and sublimation**, as well as **revolving the cinnabar furnace**.\nThen, the arts of refining the form,\nthe methods of returning to the **Primordial Origin**,\nthe trials of **demonic obstacles**,\nand the enlightenment of **verification**—\nall will be fully realized.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* know the attainment of Heaven and Earth,\nyet do not yet know the mysteries of Heaven and Earth.\nWhat are the mysteries of Heaven and Earth?\nThey are the origin of one’s parents.\nHeaven’s black essence descends like a father’s **vital seed**.\nEarth’s **qi** ascends in response like a mother’s **transforming blood**.\nWithin this union,\nthis body is formed.»\n\n「The Dao of Heaven and Earth, being both vast and enduring, lies in the interplay of **movement and stillness**, and in the **law of repose within motion**. Knowing repose within motion reveals the Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures* know the **four seasons**, yet do not grasp their **mechanism**. What is the mechanism of the four seasons?\nA human life spans a hundred years—from youth to vigor, it is the time of **weakness and infancy**. From vigor to the decline of life at sixty, it is the time of **senility and decay**, the moment of **corruption and failure**.\nThus, a single human body embodies the **seasons of Heaven and Earth**.\nTherefore, the **seasons of one’s own body** are rare and precious,\nwhile the **hours within a day** are even more fleeting.\nUnderstanding their mechanism,\nthe youth should apply themselves diligently,\nknowing the **seasons of their own body**.\nNo moment should be wasted,\nknowing the **hours within a day**.\nWithin the body, there are **years**; within the years, **months**; within the months, **days**; within the days, **hours**.\nOnly then can one align with the **Great Dao**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **solar and lunar**, must also comprehend their **numerical correspondence**.\n*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states:\n*The Great Dao is formless*, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.\n*The Great Dao is nameless*, yet it governs the **cycling of the sun and moon**.\nSilently recalling the **Two Principles**—\nthe interplay of **yin and yang**—\nassists in fulfilling the **functions of day and night**.\nThus, when **Chaos first divides**,\nthe **Primordial Yellow and Dark** distinguish their positions.\nThe forms of Heaven and Earth\nare like **joined vessels**.\nWithin the **Six Extremes**,\nthey resemble **a single egg**.\nThe **palaces of the sun and moon**,\nascending and descending by their **numerical order**,\nare like the **vital essence (魄)** of a human.\nTherefore, the adept\nmust **nurture the spirit to govern the vital essence (魄)**,\nand must not fail to know the **birth and setting of the sun and moon**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **Five Phases**,\nyet do not grasp their **proper application**.\nThey **generate and restrain** one another,\nas **father and son**,\nas **husband and wife**,\nas **lord and subject**,\nas **male and female**.\nThe human **Five Zang and Six Fu organs**,\neach correspond by analogy,\nwhile the human body contains all **Five Phases** in full.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, within the **Five Phases**,\nknow **water and fire**.\nYet how does one **discriminate between them**?\nThe **kidneys** and **heart**,\neight inches and four divisions apart,\nmark the **fixed positions of water and fire**.\nThe **vital essence (氣)** and **body fluids (液)**,\nthe **Great Sources** of **yin and yang**,\nare the **interplay of water and fire**.\nThe **heart produces fluids**,\ndescending from the **lung’s fluids** to the heart.\nThese **fluids** are the **yin**, the **home** of the **transforming blood**.\nThe **kidneys produce qi**,\nascending from the **kidney’s qi** to the heart.\nThis **qi** is the **yang**, the **chamber** of the **vital seed**.\nSometimes it flows **from above to below**,\nsometimes **from below to above**,\nas the **Two Essences** unite,\nthus it is called **True Fire, True Water**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,\nmust yet clarify the **nature of the elixirs**.\nFor **elixirs** have **internal and external** forms.\nThe **Internal Elixir**—\nits **medicinal ingredients** arise from the **heart and kidneys**,\nwhich all humans possess,\nyet one must seek the **Sacred Embryo**,\nwhereby **True Qi** is generated.\nWithin the **Qi**, there is **Qi**,\nlike **Dragon’s Pearl** or **Ox’s Yellow**,\nrooted in the **Primordial Yellow Sprout**.\nOnce the **Internal Elixir** is formed,\none can **store external medicines** in the **breathing exercises (呵呼)**,\nsuch as the **fusion of lead and mercury**,\nor the **refinement of cinnabar and silver essence**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,\nand discriminated the **medicinal ingredients**,\nmust also explain the **nature of lead and mercury**.\nWithin **cinnabar**, there is **mercury**,\ncomparable to the **Yang Dragon**.\nWithin **lead**, the **silver essence**,\ncomparable to the **Yin Tiger**.\n**Lead** is the **mother** of **silver**,\n**mercury** is the **child** of **cinnabar**.\nWhen **lead and mercury** unite,\n**refinement and tempering** naturally occur.\nPlaced in the **alchemical furnace (鼎器)**,\npaired with the **medicinal decoctions (药饵)**,\nnourished without deficiency,\nthen the **Golden Elixir** can be attained.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered **lead and mercury**,\nmust also know the **methods of distillation and sublimation**.\n**Distillation (抽)** means **to extract**,\n**sublimation (添)** means **to supplement**.\nThe **principles of extraction and supplementation**\nare the **foundation of transformation**.\nThus, Heaven and Earth—\n**yin and yang** ascending and descending—\n**transform the Six Qi**.\nThe **sun and moon cycling**—\n**transform the Nine and Six** (i.e., the **Nine Stars of the Sun and Six Stars of the Moon**).\nIf one does not grasp the **mechanism of Heaven and Earth**,\nthen **True Lead** will scatter in an instant.\nThis must be carefully remembered.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **principles of distillation and sublimation**,\nmust also know the **operations of the Cinnabar Furnace (河车)**.\nWhat is the **Cinnabar Furnace**?\nThere is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**,\nthe **Small Cinnabar Furnace**,\nand the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.\nThe **Cinnabar Furnace** is the **orthodox Qi of the North**,\nconstantly revolving,\nencompassing the **beginning of yin and yang**,\nand **matching odd and even pairs** in succession.\nInternally, it **concentrates the spirit**,\nthen **harvests medicines from Nature**,\nadvances **True Qi’s Fire**,\n**supplements mercury and extracts lead**,\nand this is the **first matter of the Small Cinnabar Furnace**.\nWhen one **passes the Three Passes with a single strike**,\ndirectly transcending to the **Inner Palace**,\n**retrieving and refining** the **posterior and anterior**,\n**nurturing the upper and lower**,\nwhile the **Great Elixir of the Yellow Court** gradually forms,\nthis is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**.\n\nWhen the **Great and Small Cinnabar Furnaces** are both in operation,\nand the **art is fully realized**,\nthe **form and Qi are unharmed**,\nthe **Dao is harmonized**,\nthen it is called the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.\nWith these **Three Furnaces** mastered,\nall take meaning from the **operations of revolving**.\nThus, **refining the form**\nis the **art of Primordial Inner Observation (元内观)**,\nall within oneself.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving heard the **precepts and prohibitions**,\nmust **diligently uphold them**.\nTime passes swiftly like a flowing stream,\nand the **pills of Qi** and **form** dissipate,\nlike **burning flames melting into embers**.\nOnce the **flames are extinguished**,\nthey **must** be **quenched**.\nEach should **early exert their efforts**,\nso that the **Six Relatives** may harmonize,\nand one may **ascend to the Six Heavens**,\nwhile the **Nine Clans** receive blessings.\n\nFrom the **origin of the Qi and pulse pathways**,\none must **obtain the smooth path**.\nThe **Scriptures of the Immortals** are near—\neach should **strive earnestly**.」\n\n「High Above the Moon Palace, the Supreme Lady of Primordial Yin (太阴元君) and the Daoist King of Filial Virtue (孝道仙王) preside over the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu Book* (灵宝净明黄素书), Volume One: *Ziming Right Canon* (紫微右典). The *Lingbao Jingming Academy* (灵宝净明院) oversees the *Right Canon* (司察右演), with Master Fu Feizheng (傅飞卿) as its interpreter.\n\nWhen **heart** and **kidney** are harmonized,\nthe **couple** is formed—\nfor they possess **constancy**.\n\nWhen **body fluids** and **essence** intermingle,\n**lead** and **mercury** emerge—\nfor they are **boundless**.\n\nTheir union has **beginning and end, dawn and dusk, singular pairs, and fullness and emptiness**.\nTrace it to **ultimate truth**,\nverify it with **ultimate numbers**,\nand within one’s **body**,\nnothing is left **unaccounted for**.\n\nThus, **Yin and Yang** alternate in **ascension and descent**,\nwith **due season** for each.\n\nWhen **heart** and **kidney** resonate,\n**essence** and **Qi** circulate—\nand their

From one to eighty-one, exhaling reveals its outward flow; swallowing reveals its inward return. Each measures three inches in length and breadth.\n\nThe **Yellow** and **White** **qi** merge—**Yellow** unites, **White** harmonizes—together forming twenty-four feet three inches, all radiant with five colors. When **qi** is still and preserved, this **qi** remains. Stored in the **Dan Tian**, it enters the spleen, enduring without dispersion. Though five colors appear, they all emanate from **Yellow** and **White**.\n\n---\n**Highest and Most Venerable Moon Palace Sovereign of the Dark Yin, Filial Dao Immortal King, Sacred Treasure Pure Clarity Yellow-White Scripture, Volume Two Complete**\n\n**Highest and Most Venerable Moon Palace Sovereign of the Dark Yin, Filial Dao Immortal King, Sacred Treasure Pure Clarity Yellow-White Scripture, Volume Three**\n\n**Yellow** gives rise to **White**, **White** to **Blue**, **Blue** to **Red**, **Red** to **Yellow**.\n**White** shares its function with **Black**, thus **White** also pertains to the lungs—this is the fixed **master qi**.\n\nWhen the two **qi** merge to form male and female, the **Yellow qi** coalesces within, the **White qi** forms the female, and the **Red qi** forms the male. Thus, the distinction between male and female lies here.\n\nWithin a single body, the kidneys form first—they are purely **yin**, hence their adaptability. The heart, paired with **Red**, requires **Yellow** to suffice. Visualize a **Yellow** crone leading a **Red**-clad man and a **White**-cloth woman to unite, as a bride through mediation—thus called **Yellow-White**. The **Red qi** seeks union; without **White** as mediator, they cannot merge. This is the meaning of **Yellow-White** union.\n\nNow, the **qi** of the five **zàng** organs throughout the body unifies, completing **Yellow** and **White**. The **Yellow-White** **qi** begins to mediate—thus, the spleen’s **qi** and the kidneys’ **Black** give rise to **Red** within.\n\nWhen **Red** meets **White** in union—**Yellow** and **Red** merge, binding heart and kidneys through the spleen’s mediation. This extends to the liver and lungs, harmonizing **Blue** and **White** **qi**. This is called the **central harmony of the five qi**.\n\nThe mingling of **qi** reaches the Five Heavens.\nThe Five Heavens’ **palace** is the ancestral **qi**.\nThe ancestral **qi** is the **clan origin of ten thousand spirits**.\nThe **clan origin of ten thousand spirits** is the **Immortal Capital’s palace**.\nWhen the utmost subtlety is united, **True** life is born.\n\n**The Scripture of the Central Harmony of the Five Qi**\n\nOnly when the five **qi** are centrally harmonized do transformations occur.\nTransformations generate the six **fǔ** organs; their ancestral **qi** originates from the **true text**.\nThe ancestral **qi** of the six **fǔ** organs is the **total qi** of **yang** and **yin**.\nWithin a single body, the **true qi** of the five **zàng** and six **fǔ** ascends to the **top gate**.\nA **auspicious cloud** arises at the crown—this is the **yin-yang** celebration.\nThe **yin-yang** celebration descends to the lower **orifice**, generating clouds.\nAbove and below unite, emerging from the two feet—**yin-yang** alternates, left and right, permeating the body.\n\nThus, within the body, **qi** and **spirit** naturally merge when preserved. Sound can then spontaneously ascend.\nThe **Heavenly Ear** hears, the **Heavenly Eye** sees. When ears and eyes are purified, **Heavenly Mysteries** are illuminated, and **Heaven and Earth** harmonize in **Great Peace**.

Palace’s** High **Lunar Sovereign**,\nthe **Filial Immortal King**,\nthe **Precious Treasure of Purity**,\nthe **Luminous Yellow-Subtle**—\n**Chapter Six** begins.\n\nTo learn **Yellow-Subtle**,\none must adjust and regulate the **Nodal Principles**,\nthe key is in **Harmony**.\nDo not let **lustful, licentious thoughts and desires** arise,\nthe mind must be upright,\nactions and stillness must not deceive.\nFor the **Soul** has never been unclean,\nthe **Spirit** has never been turbid—\nwhen the clear and turbid intermingle,\nthen **Soul-Spirit** wage war.\nThe **Soul** does not accept what is upright,\nthe **Spirit** does not submit to control.\n**Lustful desires** and **errant thoughts** drain the inner,\n**gluttony and licentiousness** harm the outer.\n**Spirit Essence** and **blood-qi** reside in the body,\nyet there are subtle weeping and lamenting—\nthis must not be unknown to man.\n\nSome say the **Dao of Immortality** is difficult,\nyet it is not necessarily true.\nThe **Hell Realms** are mere empty words.\nEven if one chases after life,\nlet alone the past—\nthis is the true folly of man.\nDo you not see?\nEven a **grass or tree**, without knowledge,\na **creeping insect**, most minute—\n**Cinnamon** gains **Scallion** and becomes **Water**,\na **rat** gains **Croton seed** and grows fat—\nnone can transform without nourishment.\nNow, man refines and ingests,\nto attain **Immortality**—\nthis is its principle.\n\nAgain, there is **Master Dong**,\nwho with four **sutra**-verses:\n\"Make **ginger** not spicy,\nand **salt** not salty.\"\nHe also uses **mantra** to influence things.\nAnd there is **Ze Sheng**,\nwho can exhale **qi** to stop **Water**,\nmaking it flow backward;\nexhale **Fire**,\nmaking it not burn.\nEven the **Black Qi** can inhibit things.\nNow, man recites **True Scripture** in the morning,\npractices **mantra-qi** in the evening,\ningests and refines with method—\nhow can **Immortality** be unattainable?\n\nNow, there are methods of **regulated eating**,\ndetailed below.\n\n**The Method of Morning Hair-Combing**\nIn combing one’s hair,\nmust face east to preserve **Green Qi**.\nFirst, use the left hand to grasp the hair,\nthe right hand to hold the comb,\nimagining as if within **Green Clouds** there is **Mysterious Thread**.\nRecite the **mantra**:\n*\"The **Great Summit** scatters its **Spirit**,\nhair becomes **Green Cloud**.\nI now comb my hair,\nto preserve **Eternal Life**.\"*\n\nThis hair-combing must not leave the bedchamber—\ncomb in one place.\nThe **East** is where **Life-Giving Qi** originates,\n**Wood** governs **spreading and flourishing**.\nMan’s hair and fur,\nlike **grass and trees**’ branches and leaves,\nthus its method is to face **East**,\nand preserve **Green Cloud**.\n\n**The Method of Clothing**\nClothing must be donned toward the **Moon’s Direction**.\nThe **mantra** says:\n*\"Heaven bestows **Golden Thread Clothing**,\n**Golden Clothing** fits when worn.\nWarmth is regulated with moderation,\nwearing it, disease departs.\"*\n\nThis method of clothing,\npreserves as if the **Five-Colored Clouds** cover the body.\nThe **Moon’s Direction** is where the **Ladle Star** points.\nUpon rising and dressing,\none must follow the **Moon’s Direction**.\nPreserve the **Five-Colored Clouds**,\ntaking the **qi** of the five **Phases** to envelop the four limbs.»\n\n**The Method of Inviting the Body’s Form**\n\nWhen one awakens from sleep, having combed the hair and donned the clothing, let them sit quietly for a moment, contemplating how all the myriad **spirits** (神) and **souls** (魂魄) gather within the body, then proceed outside to perform **ablutions** (盥漱).\n\nThe **mantra** states:\n*\"The Three Souls and Seven Spirits return to the **Zheng Palace**,\nThe Six **Organs** and Five **Visceral Stores** dwell within.\nEach guards and protects its counterpart, none may be disturbed,\nAll malevolent spirits and demons cannot approach.\nHaving thus invoked the **spirits** (神), one exits the door to perform ablutions.\"*\n\nWhen a person sleeps, their **spirit** (神) and **souls** (魂魄) scatter and fly abroad; hence, upon waking, they must summon and gather them back.\n\n**The Method of Ablutions and Washing the Face**\n\nIn all four seasons, use water from the **well’s blossoms** (井花水) to wash the face, preserving the **qi** of **sun and moon intersecting light** (日月交光之气), ensuring the **five colors** (五色) fill the center, then proceed to wash.\n\nThe **mantra** says:\n*\"Nectar of jade transforms the flesh,\nRepelling age, restoring youth.\nAuspicious blessings gather ceaselessly,\nGranting me the visage of a child.\n**Yin and Yang**, the **Five Phases**,\nAll things that retain them live, that lose them die.\nThus, one must preserve the **qi** of **sun and moon intersecting light**.\nThe **five colors** filling the center refers to their never leaving the body for an instant.\"*\n\n**The Method of Taking Medicine**\n\nWhen taking medicine, one must follow the **original direction** (本方) accordingly.\n\n**The Method of Taking Medicine (Continued)**\n\nThere are those who take medicine after eating, and those who first enter stillness and invoke the spirit—both follow their accustomed ways. The key is simplicity, avoiding excess, lest **qi** and blood be overstrained.\n\n**Mantra for Taking Medicine:**\n*\"Immortal elixirs of Penglai secure eternal life,\nThe **Dao**-medicine kings of sun and moon aid my path.\nTaken, one may live a thousand years or more,\nAll malevolent **qi** departs, vanishing like dust and smoke.\nAll things possess sentience; they nourish the human.\nWhen **essence** gathers, the spirit follows—thus, invoke the **Dao**-medicine kings.\nWhen spirit and **qi** align, righteous **qi** thrives, malevolent **qi** dissipates—\nThus, they depart like smoke and dust.*\n\n**The Method of Entering Stillness**\nWhen entering stillness, one may recite scriptures, cultivate **qi**, or pay homage to the divine—each follows its own tradition. Yet the human soul and spirit intermingle with **yin qi**; fear may arise, so first calm them with a mantra.\n\n**Mantra for Calming the Spirit:**\n*\"The five **zàng**-organs, fragrant officials of the sun-king,\nJoin me in this departure toward the True.\nGuide my spirit and cognition to clarity,\nMay no fear or terror cause them to scatter.\"*\n\nReciting scriptures, cultivating **qi**, or paying homage—all involve directing one’s own spirit toward another’s, uniting **yang** with **yin**. Thus, one must first calm the spirit before offering reverence.\n\n**The Method of Eating and Drinking**\nWhen consuming the five flavors, regulation must be observed, never neglecting the proper timing, so that harmony comes naturally. As for fasting and **intermittent abstinence**, one must do so with discipline—until the Great Medicine of **golden elixir** is attained, such practices should not be undertaken lightly.\n\nMeals should be taken before the hour of *shen* (3–5 PM). Beyond this time, even abundant food yields no benefit.\n\n**Mantra for Meals:**\n*\"Divine kitchen of Heaven, grant me sustenance.\nDivine kitchen of Heaven, grant me sustenance.\"*\n\n**The Method of Regulating Qi After Eating**\nAfter eating, wipe the face with a hand to induce perspiration, making it radiant.\nThen, massage the abdomen gently while walking slowly along the veranda for five to seven *li*, before stopping.\n\n**Mantra:**\n*\"The True One of Heaven’s center gathers within me,\nA hundred malevolences dare not approach or harm.\nWherever I walk, ghosts and spirits recoil in awe,\nDispelling demons and calamities, leaving no trace.\"*\n\n**The Method of Using the Toilet**\nWhen using the toilet, impure **qi** arises, risking harm to the spirit **qi**. One must first shake out the clothing.\nAfter reciting the mantra, repeat:\n\n*\"With the five **zàng**-organs and five grains, I nourish my **essence**.\nI purge the rotten remains, lest they harm the spirit.\nWhen the matter is concluded, know this.\"*\n\n**The Method of Using the Toilet (Continued)**\nWhen using the toilet, avoid doing so beneath the sun, moon, stars, or constellations, nor facing east or northeast.\nImpure **qi** and corruption are contrary to the divine, so one must recite the mantra to dispel filth and preserve the spirit.\n\n**The Method of Sleeping**\nWhen lying down, one must face east or south to align with the convergence of the two *dou* (cosmic poles).\nThe mantra states:\n*\"The Five Celestial Guards and the Spirit **Qi** enfold my body,\nWithin dreams and waking, the soul and spirit remain at peace.\"*\n\nEast and south are where the **yang qi** resides.\nThose who cultivate the **Dao** refine **yin** to return to **yang**, so their sleep should mirror Confucius’ eastward posture or Guangchengzi’s southward one.\n\nFurther, align with the two *dou* of south and north to absorb the **Dao’s** true **yang** and **yin**, thus sheltering the body.\n\n---\n**End of the Sixth Volume of *The Yellow Silk Scripture of the Highest Purity and Divine Treasure of the Moon Palace’s Sovereign, the Mother of Great Darkness***\n\n**Seventh Volume of *The Yellow Silk Scripture of the Highest Purity and Divine Treasure of the Moon Palace’s Sovereign, the Mother of Great Darkness***\n\nThe **spleen** is the central sovereign, governing the **zàng**-organs’ **zhèng qi** (true **qi**).\nThe **lungs** are the general, commanding the five **qi**’s breath.\nIf breath falters even once, illness arises; if **qi** does not generate, death follows.\nThus, the **lungs** must cover above, and the **spleen** must support below—this is the fundamental principle of the *Yellow Silk Scripture*.\nAt the hours of *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) and *wu* (11 AM–1 PM), visualize a child holding a yellow banner within the **spleen** and **lungs**.\nIf **white qi** appears, like wind stirring the banner,\nclose the breath and focus the mind—then all distractions will cease.\nThe five **zàng**-organs all nourish **essence** and **qi**, yet here the emphasis lies on the **spleen** and **lungs**.\nThe **heart** and **kidneys** are husband and wife,\nwhile the **spleen** and **lungs** are mother and child.\nOnly after mother and child nourish each other does the father-son relationship arise—thus the **liver** generates, and the **liver** gives birth to the **heart**.\nThe **heart** is the sovereign; thus, this is the **Dao** of lord and minister, preserved in sequence.\n\nHeaven is high, Earth is low; the three **yin** and three **yang** circulate within.\nIn one’s body, **yin** and **yang qi** flow through.\nHarmony brings peace; imbalance brings illness.\nThus, when cold or heat overpowers, it becomes *nuè* (malaria-like fever) or *lì* (severe cold).\nIf **yang qi** is excessive while **yin** is suppressed, it becomes *lì*.\nIf **yang qi** is suppressed while **yin** is excessive, it becomes *wēn* (epidemic disease).\nIf **yang qi** is stagnant and does not circulate, it becomes *jū* (ulcerous sores).\nIf blood and **qi** are blocked, it becomes *yǒu* (a wasting disease).\nAll these manifest as bear-like afflictions, threatening life itself.\n\nMany know how illness harms, yet few grasp cultivation to achieve longevity.\nThey see distant threats yet fail to observe those near at hand.\nIf you cover one eye, you cannot see.\nIf you pinch one ear, you cannot hear.\nIf you hold your breath, internal **qi** cannot escape.\nIf you sneeze, external **qi** cannot enter.\nUnderstanding this, how can you doubt that focusing the mind and calling **qi** can bring harmony?\n\nOnly by mastering focused contemplation and **qi**-invocation can one grasp the *Yellow Silk Scripture*’s true essence.\nWhat is the true essence?\nAll else is not the true essence.\nThe eyes perceive color, the ears hear sound, the nose smells fragrance, the mouth tastes flavor—\nlust for clothing, money, or filth; or entanglement in debauchery and deceit—\nall arise from imagination.\nIf you focus correctly, what you attain will also be effortless.\nThus, the **Dao** of *Yellow Silk Scripture* is easier than pursuing the pleasures of the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.\nThose who attain this **Dao** will prevail.\n\nWhat does it mean to prevail?\nNo one does not desire longevity, yet this method can grant it.\nNo one does not desire divinity, yet this method can achieve it.\nThus, the **Dao** of longevity and immortality lies not in idle thought but in focused contemplation to align with the true essence.\n\nThe **Dao** is without contemplation or action.\nWithout contemplation does not mean one never contemplates—\ncontemplation is the rectification of nature.\nWithout action does not mean one never acts—\naction is the fulfillment of principle.\nIf one insists on \"without contemplation,\" they are no better than beasts.\nIf one insists on \"without action,\" they are no better than stone.\nTo mistake beasts and stone for the **Dao**, saying,\n*\"I have no contemplation; I have no action,\"*\nis false.\n\nNow, if a person sits in a grand hall,\nfire rising from above—they will flee;\nwater overflowing from below—they will flee.\nIf they do not flee, it is because they discern whether the threat is true or false.\nIf they can discern correctly, they must say:\n*\"Fire and water approach, threatening my life—I must flee!\"*\nYet if the **Dao** is claimed to be without contemplation or action,\nwhile also relying on focused visualization and **qi**-invocation,\nthis is a contradiction—and it is not so.\n\nThus, the mind feels, the spirit condenses, the **qi** interacts, and sincerity is achieved.\nWhat is *feeling*?\nIt is responding to sound.\nWhat is *condensing*?\nIt is focusing on one thing and becoming still.\nWhat is *interacting*?\nIt is stillness that allows interaction.\nWhat is *achieving*?\nIt is interaction that brings fulfillment.\n\nFor the silent morning audience method of communicating with the heavens,\nthis principle applies—then the soul and spirit will not wander,\nand the audience will not be lost.\nIf, during this time, a boy stands beside you,\nstriking the *zhèng* (metallophone) or walking in empty space,\nand your spirit rises with the sound,\nthen upon returning, it will also seek the sound—\nthis is the supreme method.\n\nThese techniques vary widely, yet beyond them lies an essential truth.\nNow, many cultivate the **Dao** and seek the spirit,\nyet they only refine **yin qi**—like the *Yuángāng* (primordial **qi**) walking method.\nWithin *Yuángāng*, there is also the method of **yang qi**.\nDirectly within the physical form, its benefits are immediate,\nthough refining **yin qi** for ten years is still difficult.\nMethods like the *Rìyuè Jié Lún Gāoběn* (sun-moon purification of the essence’s foundation) are **yang**-based,\nrequiring deep familiarity—if not, one will be attached to other practices.\n\nFew can ascend and transform, yet many can shed their bones.\nAt the moment of shedding bones,\none must be thoroughly familiar with the *Yuángāng* walking method,\nthe palace courts and morning audiences,\nand the proper responses to the celestial throne.\nIgnorance here will invite the *Luóxiá* (demons) and a hundred ghosts\nto deceive and ensnare you within the realm.\nOnly those who recognize this danger will succeed.\n\nThe eyes round—these are evil ghosts.\nWhen my mind knows this, ghosts and spirits will fear death as well.\nTo hear and see spirits, one must scrutinize carefully.\nPure and refined ghosts may feign true immortals,\nleading astray by calling error truth and truth error—\nmost misleading to later learners.\nOnly by recognizing sincerity can one discern.\nTemple hair greenish-blue, face red with square eyes—\nthese are the true high immortals.\nShould any of these signs be lacking, it is not so.\nAt this time, with right mindfulness, demons and evils will retreat and submit.\n\n---\n**Yellow Silk Canon, Volume Seven of the High Celestial Moon Palace, Great Yin Yuanjun Filial Dao

Bright Yellow Silk Scripture** begins.\n\n**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Upper Section**\nThe divine palace looms atop Kunlun’s peak,\nBeneath Kunlun’s mountain, the Double Bay flows.\nClear and turbid *qi* divide into dark and yellow,\nDark and yellow *qi* settle into round and square.\nThe two *qi* intermingle, generating yin and yang,\nYin and yang illuminate the central hall with soul and spirit.\nTo gather them requires the art of the heart-mind,\nWhen refined, they become nourishment like rich grains.\nNo need for five grains to fill the storehouses—\nConsuming them long enough ensures well-being.\nDragon chariots and phoenix attendants enter the round light,\nEach diagram’s secret installed within the palace.\nThe Yang Emperor and Yin Child bow in reverence,\nAt seventy-seven breaths, spirit and *qi* unite.\nReturning to the chariot’s wheel, back to the original palace,\nNaturally, the Dao is complete—soaring through empty space.\n\n**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Middle Section**\nThe marvel of husband and wife lies in primal function,\nOne inhalation, one exhalation—*qi* grows dense.\nSeal the lips, swallow gently like wind through clouds,\nSweet as ghee and milk, filling the heart-chest.\nNaturally plump with spirited vigor,\nAugmented by the great elixir’s nourishment.\nNurtured thus, *qi* and blood flush the cheeks red,\nNo need for five grains—swallowing wind-clouds instead.\nFive grains originally nourish *qi* and blood,\nSeven days without them exhausts human fate.\nThe Master abstains—there must be method,\nGradual and sudden techniques honed together.\nPine, cypress, hempseed—*qi* flavors blend,\nMountain grains and surplus stores preserve the center.\nMust daily consume *qi* to fill the void,\nOnly then can the great elixir perfect primal function.\n\n**Yellow Silk Inner Classic, Lower Section**\nHuman elixir cannot be forced—\nTo forge it requires virtue and wisdom.\nThe five viscera need no filth to cleanse,\nBut must preserve whole spirit, essence, and *qi*.\nFull essence, robust spirit—endure a hundred ages,\nNaturally, heart and spirit align.\nAll learners must unite in intent,\nNot in abstinence alone, nor swallowing *qi*.\nSwallowing *qi* after fasting—quick ascension,\nBut ascension demands restraint—great fate depends.\nOtherwise, mere longevity extends years,\nLongevity’s elixir delays but does not transcend.\nMountain grains refined with water decoction,\nBee’s wax refined a hundred times into pills.\nIf taken properly, *qi* remains whole,\nFasting allows the form to transcend.\n\n**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Upper Section**\nGarden osmanthus guides the five flavors’ master,\nBalancing the five *qi* to generate vital resources.\nRepelling filth, dispelling serpentine toxins,\nTurning back age—most wondrous for longevity.\nEmerging from water, entering fire—rare and strange,\nChewing finely, swallowing saliva while riding swift.\nFive clouds converge—most harmonious,\nDrinking and pecking naturally cease hunger.\nGrowing plump without peril, branches and leaves transmit essence.\nWinning pure saliva from the Flower Pool,\nAdding primal essence to the four limbs.\n\n**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Middle Section**\nErratic heart-mind—how can it cease?\nDao scriptures and spirit medicines suit this.\nChewing hempseed finely, swallowing it,\nCan moisten and dispel the Three Corpses.\nNo errant thoughts—corpses return not,\nNaturally, soul and spirit wander not east or west.\nLong practice erases all thought—\nOr grind *fu-ling* into paste,\nOr crush *mài-fú* for its fat,\nTo make the spirit swallow the Flower Pool’s essence.\nPrevent greed’s saliva from causing calamity,\nGuarding elixirs requires careful seeking.\nThe great elixir’s power must be sustained.\n\n**Yellow Silk Outer Classic, Lower Section**\nWithout learning abstinence, no ascension.\nWithin abstinence, *qi* is most refined.\nNo glutinous rice—no demonic stench,\nNatural purity returns to the central court.\nTen years within the heavenly kitchen’s refinement,\nMorning and evening, feasts arrive in procession.\nMoreover, restraining desire preserves essence,\nNo craving for the three repugnant or five pungent.\nThe Supreme’s medicine is in the prior classic,\nFurther sacrificial rites require meat and blood.\nTo repel the nine ranks of spirits,\nThe nine ranks take worm-like form.\nMixing meat with medicine dissolves their shape,\n*Fu-ling* and hempseed—two refined essences.\nForming thin porridge at dawn,\nOne dose per decade—\nOne dose dissolves the nine ranks like ice.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nAbstinence cannot grant longevity,\nBut it can refine spirit and attain immortality.\nTo attain immortality requires virtue’s function,\nFunction demands years of cultivation—\nThus, elixirs seek longevity,\nAbstinence aims for ascension.\nFunction lies in dual accumulation,\nPractice must be complete in both.\nFilial piety hides within the heart’s knowing,\nCultivation and refinement perfect conduct.\nWithout slacking in practice,\nA single leap returns to the Azure Sky.\n\nAscension has its method,\nNot in bodily flight.\nFlight while bearing the elixir’s decree—\nOnly then is one a true great immortal.\nIf only skilled in rising,\nThis is called the Empty-Walking Immortal.\nRiding on pretense or falsehood—\nThis discerns our true function.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe true Dao originates from the mind’s intent.\nAll false perceptions arise from the mind itself.\nAs with abstinence—\nYears pass without hunger.\nSeven days without food—\nIllness comes, and death follows.\nMan can endure years without hunger,\nOr perish in seven days.\nLife and death differ,\nYet their methods are the same.\nNot hungry, not desiring—\nThis comes from the true and real.\nTalismans and spell-water\nAlso stem from thought and deliberation.\nSpirit and *qi* in harmony—\nNaturally, they fill and overflow.\nThoughts of death arise from false perception.\nFive flavors’ fragrance—\nGreed’s saliva overflows.\nSpirit disperses, causing hunger and thirst.\nTruly, all human action—\nSome true, some errant—\nMust be approached with caution.\nLike\n\nIf sweat does not originate from the hand,\nthen from where does sweat come?\nThus, sweat arises from the mind,\nwhile evil arises from the hand.\nMind and hand in resonance—\nnaturally, sweat emerges.\n\nAgain, the fragrance of fine aromas—\nseeing them provokes swallowing.\nFilth and impurity in drink—\nhearing them provokes vomiting.\nSwallowing and vomiting originally arise from the fragrance of fine aromas and filth.\nThus, before tasting fine aromas or filth,\none assumes they do not enter the body,\nbelieving that swallowing and vomiting come from within.\nThen fine aromas are not vomited,\nand filth is not swallowed—\nthus, fine aromas and filth also arise from the mind’s thought.\n\nSince it is known that thought originates from the mind,\none must guard against the mind’s false thoughts.\nThis is what is meant by thought—\nas such.\n\n---\n**The Sacred Scripture of the Yellow Silk, Volume Eight Complete**\n**The Sacred Scripture of the Yellow Silk, Volume Nine**\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Celestial Palace exists within the body—\nyet it is not the body itself;\nThe Underworld exists within the body—\nyet it is not the body itself.\nThe Celestial Palace exists outside—\nyet it is not outside;\nThe Underworld exists outside—\nyet it is not outside.\nIf it is neither within the body nor outside,\nthen where does it reside?\nTen thousand attachments give rise to thought,\nand thought truly originates from the mind.\nArising from the mind, it is as if the scene lies outside.\nJust as in a sealed chamber,\nwhere no other things exist,\nthe flowers outside the chamber\nare unseen within.\nYet when one closely contemplates the flowers before them,\nthe floral scene appears before the eyes.\nThus, the Celestial Palace and Underworld\nenter clearly through false perception.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe desire between male and female\narises from yin and yang.\nWithin yin and yang,\nthe distinction of male and female emerges.\nA beautiful husband and ugly wife—\nthough they do not please each other;\nA beautiful wife and ugly husband—\nit is the same.\nThe difference between beauty and ugliness\nlies in the male and female distinction.\nSome find each other pleasing,\nothers do not—\nthus, the desire of male and female\nis like beauty and ugliness.\nThe perception of beauty and ugliness\ndoes not depend on male and female.\nOnce, a blind man\ncoupled with an ugly woman,\nyet found her as beautiful as a fair one.\nThus, the perception of beauty and ugliness\nis like the distinction of male and female.\nTherefore, the so-called male and female distinction\nis irrelevant.\nThe mind’s desire for beauty arises from lust,\nlust arises from lewdness,\nand lewdness’s fluids intermingle,\nrooted in false perception.\nControlled by false perception,\nthe essence is not true—\nthis is called *Jingming* (Pure Clarity).\n\nYellow Silk says:\nFluids arise from the mind,\nthe mind arises from fluids—\nthe thought of mind and fluids\nis where they originate.\nThe fluids of tears and mucus,\nthe kinship of flesh and bone.\nWhen the close one dies,\none weeps before seeing them.\nWhen the distant one dies,\none covers their nose and passes by.\nThough tears and mucus are one,\nproximity and distance lie in the mind.\nThe mind’s thought generates fluids,\nfluids transform into tears and mucus.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nTo be steadfast and responsive—\nsteadfastness is unity.\nResponsiveness is thought.\nUnity in what is contemplated\nis the true and real.\nThe *qi* within the mind\noriginates from the formless.\nThe bone at the crown\nis form and thus firm.\nThe thought of the body’s *qi*\nshatters this firm bone.\nBone is black, void within—\nbone opens due to *qi*.\n*Qi* is formless,\nyet thought makes it pass through.\nAs with false thought,\nhow could the bone open?\nPressing the crown with the hand,\nthe crown is already open.\nSeizing *qi* with the hand,\n*qi* has never existed.\nWhat thought touches\nresults in the bone’s opening and closing.\nWhen *qi* attacks,\nthe body’s firmness and *qi*’s completeness—\nwhy could they not be one?\nGuiding and drawing *qi* generates *qi*,\n*qi* generates essence and fluids,\nessence and fluids generate spirit,\nthus achieving longevity and clear vision.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Heavenly Palace is in the crown—\nyet it is not in the crown.\nWithin the crown is a palace,\nnamed the Heavenly Palace.\nThe layered towers are in the lungs—\nyet they are not in the lungs.\nThe Mysterious Capital is in the kidneys—\nyet it is not in the kidneys.\nThe Yellow Court is in the spleen—\nyet it is not in the spleen.\nThe Red Suspension is in the heart—\nyet it is not in the heart.\nThe Azure Capital is in the liver—\nyet it is not in the liver.\nIf they are not truly there,\nthen where do they reside?\nWithin the five contemplations,\nthought truly arises.\nThe Hidden Heaven is in Heaven,\nHeaven within Heaven.\nThe Concealed Earth is in Earth,\nEarth within Earth.\nThe true forms of Heaven and Earth—\nwhat other forms do they have?\nThus, the true forms of Heaven and Earth\nare also generated by thought.\nWhat thought generates\nis originally complete and real.\nThus, the mind’s true contemplation\ntruly contains Heaven and Earth.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nAll beings of every kind\nhave not yet been born.\nIn the Northern Heaven, there are countless affections and desires,\nthus there are Heavenly Palaces and Underworlds.\nEgg-born, womb-born, damp-born, and transformed-born—\nall arise from lewdness.\nOne must know that entanglement,\nwith love as its root.\nWith all false perceptions,\nfostering attachment and affection,\nthus the cycle of birth and death ensnares.\nDesire arises from love,\nlife from desire’s attachment.\nFrom desire’s thought,\nall adverse and favorable circumstances arise.\nTurning away from love,\nanger and resentment emerge.\nCreating countless evils—\nthis is the Underworld.\nKnowing desire’s repugnance,\nabandoning pleasure and fleeing evil,\nthinking with goodness—\nthis is called *Jingming* (Pure Clarity).\nSealing the true mark in the Clear Bright Realm,\none attains the Dao.\nAll dharmas arise from original desire,\nunfolding false perceptions,\nthus generating afflictions.\nFrom these afflictions,\none falls into birth and death,\nmanifesting the prisons of Heaven and Earth.\nThus, there are *Tángdū* demons devouring bodies—\nall due to false union,\naccumulating karmic offenses.\nBut if one awakens to *Jingming*,\nentering the true mark of the Extreme,\nfirst, one must take the vow,\nachieving the Eight Extremes,\nobtaining *Jingming*—\nthis is the true and real,\nentering the Great Dao.\n\nYellow Silk says:\n*Sincere loyalty* is the present meaning of *Jingming*.\nTo die for one’s body is filial piety—\nthis is *Jingming*’s benevolence.\nTo achieve a good name and purity—\nthis is *Jingming*;\nTo not covet profit or fame—\nlawful forbearance is *Jingming*;\nTo not be rash in anger—\nself-restraint is *Jingming*;\nTo act with reverence and caution—\ntolerance is *Jingming*;\nTo be vast and luminous—\nmagnanimity is *Jingming*;\nTo rejoice in one’s portion—\nforbearance is *Jingming*.\nHidden in illness,\nwithin *Jingming*, the thought is true.\n\nThe thought, when kept pure,\nhas never failed to attain immortality.\nThus, those with *Jiawei*—\npossess an unassailable countenance;\nthose who weep—\nutter sounds that cannot be heard by others;\nthose who commune with ghosts and spirits in sacrifice—\nall arise from this.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nIf thought is deemed delusion, who is without thought?\nIf thoughtlessness is true, who has thought?\nIf thought is delusion, how do you know?\nIf it is not, then it is not—it is not existence.\nIf thoughtlessness is not delusion, how do you know?\nIf it exists, then it is existence—knowing that non-existence is non-existence.\nIf non-existence is non-existence, then it is the law of *Jingming*.\n\nA mirror reflects—water becomes that mirror,\nand in water, *Jingming* is seen.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nWhen facing the water’s reflection,\nit only shows me—\nnot my true form—\nthus, there is no true mirror.\nIf water reveals my true eyebrows, eyes, ears, and nose,\nhow do I know it is true?\nYou do not see the form—how do you know it is yours?\nIf you pinch your face with your hand,\nthe shadow in the mirror, the shadow in the water—\nalso shows the hand pinching the face.\nIf others do not pinch, they see no hand.\nThus, the hand is inherently mine, not theirs.\nThe hand is in me—\nthus, this face is truly my face,\nknowing the Eight Extremes through hand and face.\nIf it is in me, it is not the Eight Extremes;\nif it is in another, it is not *Jingming*.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe origin of *Jingming* lies in true nature.\nWithin nature, there is function,\nrooted in true thought.\nWithin thought, there is delusion—\nthus, *Jingming* is lost.\nLike a mirror in water,\nif dust and filth obscure it,\nit cannot reflect objects—\nwhen objects obscure nature,\nthought is not true,\nand *Jingming* is lost.\n\n---\n**Volume Nine of the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu* by the Highest Moon Palace, Taoyin Yuanjun, the Daoist King of Filial Piety, concludes.**\n**Volume Ten of the *Lingbao Jingming Huangsu* begins.**\n\nYellow Silk says:\nParents are the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nThe sovereign is the Sun and Moon.\nThere has never been one who existed before Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon,\nyet could act in the world.\nThus, the foundation of filial piety\nscatters as loyalty and filiality.\nThe virtues of loyalty and filiality\nare perfected in the Great Dao,\ntranscending the immortal realm—\nthus, their rightness.\n\nA person’s body is like Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth as parents are like Original *Qi*.\nThe sovereign as Sun and Moon is like the heart and kidneys, ears and eyes.\nThere has never been one without these who could attain longevity—\nit depends on steadfast loyalty and filiality.\nLife is the Eight Extremes;\nwhen the Eight Extremes are complete,\nlike a sturdy beam,\nwho could topple it?\n\nYellow Silk says:\n*Xin* (faith) is *qi*.\nA person’s *qi* flows continuously,\nlike the four seasons of Heaven—\nbreathing and pulse numbers—\nif disrupted, it becomes illness.\nCold, heat, yin, and rain transform—\nthen disaster arises.\nWhen a person lacks faith,\ndisaster and illness emerge.\nThus, beyond the Eight Extremes,\nthere is also faith.\nYang *qi* sprouts in the Yellow Bell organ—\nfaith arises within it.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe *Jing* (essence) of Yellow Silk has inner and outer aspects.\nThe inner *Jing* is clear and bright,\nthe outer *Jing* is luminous and transparent,\nlike a *liuli* (glazed) pearl—\nalso able to illuminate.\nLike ice, clear and pure,\nit melts and dissolves.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThose who know *Móming* (enlightenment)\nare like casting a name into a *liuli* bottle—\nvisible both inside and out.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nTo study the Dao broadly,\nbroadness must be precise.\nOnce precise, one must know its principles.\nKnowing the principles,\nfocus on what is essential.\nOnce the essential is grasped,\nthe Dao becomes easily known.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nAll under Heaven converges in unity—\nattaining the hundred concerns.\nThe Dao is attained through unity—\nthere is no other way.\nLike the paths of east, west, south, and north,\nconverging at the center.\nRivers and lakes,\nall flow into the sea.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nTrue nature is nature;\nhabit is not nature.\nThe ten habits are:\n1. Lustful habit.\n2. Greedy habit.\n3. Arrogant habit.\n4. Angry habit.\n5. Deceitful habit.\n6. Fraudulent habit.\n7. Resentful habit.\n8. Superficial habit.\n9. Crooked habit.\n10. Litigious habit.\nWhen these ten habits are polished away,\nthe Dao of *Jingming* emerges.\nIf thought is impure,\nthe true is lost.\nLosing the true,\ntrue nature is obscured—\nthus, *Jingming*’s principles are lost,\ngiving rise to false perceptions.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Dao is originally empty yet real.\nWhat is emptiness?\nThat which has no foundation is emptiness.\nThat which has a foundation is reality.\nHeaven’s reality is in its height.\nEarth’s reality is in its breadth.\nGhosts and spirits’ reality is in their numinousness.\nThe reality of *Jingming* is in *Jingming*—\nthus, *Jingming* is reality.\nBeyond true reality,\nall else is illusory.\nWhat is illusory?\nIf one takes intelligence as reality,\nthe Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.\nIf one takes speech as reality,\nthe Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.\nIf one takes cleverness and deceit as reality,\nthe Dao of *Jingming* cannot be founded upon it.\nWhat can be relied upon\nis what is practiced in true reality.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nWhat is *shǒu* (guard)?\nTo guard in unity.\nUnity is unchanging—\nonly the unchanging can transform endlessly;\none transformation leads to seven,\nseven transformations lead to nine,\nnine transformations return to unity.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Dao is not distant—\nit lies in the eyebrows and eyelashes.\nThe Dao is within—\nin the chest and abdomen.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Dao values essence,\nessence lies in simplicity,\nsimplicity lies in detail,\ndetail lies in principles.\nThus, Yellow Silk is the framework of *Jingming*.\nLike grasping the collar of a robe\nto know the order of the collar and lining.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe three *Ling* (numinous) scriptures have a unified law.\nThe essential principle of the Supreme Sovereign\ncan be expressed in one phrase\nto equal the three *Ling* scriptures.\nIf held steadfastly,\nits efficacy is equal.\nIt can calm concerns and gather *shao* (summon),\nconcentrate the spirit and nurture the true—\nthis is essence and detail.\n\nIncantation:\n*Om* Sūluónà Sūlūsūshāfúhē.\n\nThe learned scholar, like holding a *lunzhū* (wheel-bead),\ncalled the *jièzhū* (precept-bead),\nfrom beginning to end—\nthe hundred spirits guard and the five *qi* settle,\ninner thoughts cut off evil,\nouterly welcoming the true—\nthis is called *Zǒng Xuán* (Total Mystery).\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe *Jingming* (Pure Clarity) defense has a precept:\nHold the *shūzhū* (output-bead) and *lunzhū* (wheel-bead),\nnever release them without cause.\nMaintain the right mindfulness\nand return to right thought.\nBefore seeing the *bǎoyìn* (treasure-seal),\nfirst perceive the *shūzhū*.\nThe *lunzhū* is boundless—\nthis is the *Jingming* method,\nthus it can equal my mirror-water.\nMirror-water as the seat,\nwhile the *shūzhū* moves and stops in accordance.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nWith the mirror reflecting form,\nwithin form there is spirit.\nWith spirit merging with water,\nwithin water there is the true.\nThrough prolonged practice,\none can see the numinous spirit\nand repel demonic forces.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe *Yuāngāng* (Primordial Rigidity) flying spirit\nmust recognize the Dao’s pathways.\nThe *yángshén* (yang spirit) knowing the path\nis how one attends the Primordial and does not err.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe *Yuāngāng* rigid path—\nthe *qi* of intersecting *gāng* (rigid lines).\nIts firmness is like steel;\npracticed long, one treads and ascends to empty space.\nBut with right thought,\nleaping with both shoulders,\nthe spirit’s transformation comes naturally.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nHeaven and Earth move the true,\nthe sun and moon move clarity,\nthe four seasons move sequence,\nyin and yang move harmony.\nWhen Heaven issues killing intent,\nwhen Earth issues killing intent,\nthe sun and moon alternate with the four seasons,\nyet the *wǔ* (martial) *yin-yang qi* alternate as dust.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nFortune and misfortune\nare used to admonish the virtuous—\nthis is *pǐ* (stop).\nRegret and hesitation\nare used to clarify movement—\nthis is *zhǐ* (halt).\nDisaster and filth\nare used to repay the noble—\nthis is the petty.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe *língxiǎng* (numinous echoes)\nare born from the heart.\nWhen the heart reaches,\nthe numinous responds.\nWhen the heart does not reach,\nnone can attain the numinous echoes.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe sun and moon in the sky—\ntheir essence can be obtained and savored.\nYin and yang, formless—\ntheir *qi* can be obtained and breathed.\nGhosts and spirits, most subtle—\ntheir emotions and forms can be obtained and summoned.\nThis is the heart reaching,\nand the numinous responding.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe Dao has a beginning and end,\nyet its beginning cannot be exhausted.\nOnly because it cannot be exhausted,\ndoes it begin at the beginning and end at the end.\n\n*The Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure, Pure Clarity, Yellow Silk, Volume Ten, concludes.*",

When reflecting on their past, they must carefully examine their intentions.\n\nThose who tread the path of public service must understand the true purpose of their office.\nThose who wield the people’s strength must know the proper way to serve them.\nThose who have living parents must recognize that the debt of filial piety cannot be repaid with tears, nor can the dead be consoled with lamentations.\nOnly those who have lost both parents know the unbearable weight of grief.\nYet if they can grasp that those who turn toward the Dao will succeed, transcending worldly records and rising above ordinary status, their teachings will be universally followed. Extend this to the world, and there will be none who cannot be reached.\n\nThe loyal will revere it to its utmost; the filial will follow it to its utmost. If one embodies both reverence and filial duty without failing, then those in public service will labor night and day without rest to serve their superiors, and with kindness and benevolence to nurture those beneath them—thus knowing the true purpose of their office.\n\nBy following the Dao of Heaven, sharing the benefits of Earth, moderating oneself and regulating expenditures, and remembering one’s sovereign and parents, one knows the proper way to serve the people.\nThe body, flesh, and bones are received from one’s parents, and the debt of gratitude is boundless as the sky.

Earth**.\nTherefore, the **seasons of one’s own body** are rare and precious,\nwhile the **hours within a day** are even more fleeting.\nUnderstanding their mechanism,\nthe youth should apply themselves diligently,\nknowing the **seasons of their own body**.\nNo moment should be wasted,\nknowing the **hours within a day**.\nWithin the body, there are **years**; within the years, **months**; within the months, **days**; within the days, **hours**.\nOnly then can one align with the **Great Dao**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **solar and lunar**, must also comprehend their **numerical correspondence**.\n*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states:\n*The Great Dao is formless*, yet it gives birth to Heaven and Earth.\n*The Great Dao is nameless*, yet it governs the **cycling of the sun and moon**.\nSilently recalling the **Two Principles**—\nthe interplay of **yin and yang**—\nassists in fulfilling the **functions of day and night**.\nThus, when **Chaos first divides**,\nthe **Primordial Yellow and Dark** distinguish their positions.\nThe forms of Heaven and Earth\nare like **joined vessels**.\nWithin the **Six Extremes**,\nthey resemble **a single egg**.\nThe **palaces of the sun and moon**,\nascending and descending by their **numerical order**,\nare like the **vital essence (魄)** of a human.\nTherefore, the adept\nmust **nurture the spirit to govern the vital essence (魄)**,\nand must not fail to know the **birth and setting of the sun and moon**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, having known the **Five Phases**,\nyet do not grasp their **proper application**.\nThey **generate and restrain** one another,\nas **father and son**,\nas **husband and wife**,\nas **lord and subject**,\nas **male and female**.\nThe human **Five Zang and Six Fu organs**,\neach correspond by analogy,\nwhile the human body contains all **Five Phases** in full.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*, within the **Five Phases**,\nknow **water and fire**.\nYet how does one **discriminate between them**?\nThe **kidneys** and **heart**,\neight inches and four divisions apart,\nmark the **fixed positions of water and fire**.\nThe **vital essence (氣)** and **body fluids (液)**,\nthe **Great Sources** of **yin and yang**,\nare the **interplay of water and fire**.\nThe **heart produces fluids**,\ndescending from the **lung’s fluids** to the heart.\nThese **fluids** are the **yin**, the **home** of the **transforming blood**.\nThe **kidneys produce qi**,\nascending from the **kidney’s qi** to the heart.\nThis **qi** is the **yang**, the **chamber** of the **vital seed**.\nSometimes it flows **from above to below**,\nsometimes **from below to above**,\nas the **Two Essences** unite,\nthus it is called **True Fire, True Water**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,\nmust yet clarify the **nature of the elixirs**.\nFor **elixirs** have **internal and external** forms.\nThe **Internal Elixir**—\nits **medicinal ingredients** arise from the **heart and kidneys**,\nwhich all humans possess,\nyet one must seek the **Sacred Embryo**,\nwhereby **True Qi** is generated.\nWithin the **Qi**, there is **Qi**,\nlike **Dragon’s Pearl** or **Ox’s Yellow**,\nrooted in the **Primordial Yellow Sprout**.\nOnce the **Internal Elixir** is formed,\none can **store external medicines** in the **breathing exercises (呵呼)**,\nsuch as the **fusion of lead and mercury**,\nor the **refinement of cinnabar and silver essence**.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **union of Dragon and Tiger**,\nand discriminated the **medicinal ingredients**,\nmust also explain the **nature of lead and mercury**.\nWithin **cinnabar**, there is **mercury**,\ncomparable to the **Yang Dragon**.\nWithin **lead**, the **silver essence**,\ncomparable to the **Yin Tiger**.\n**Lead** is the **mother** of **silver**,\n**mercury** is the **child** of **cinnabar**.\nWhen **lead and mercury** unite,\n**refinement and tempering** naturally occur.\nPlaced in the **alchemical furnace (鼎器)**,\npaired with the **medicinal decoctions (药饵)**,\nnourished without deficiency,\nthen the **Golden Elixir** can be attained.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered **lead and mercury**,\nmust also know the **methods of distillation and sublimation**.\n**Distillation (抽)** means **to extract**,\n**sublimation (添)** means **to supplement**.\nThe **principles of extraction and supplementation**\nare the **foundation of transformation**.\nThus, Heaven and Earth—\n**yin and yang** ascending and descending—\n**transform the Six Qi**.\nThe **sun and moon cycling**—\n**transform the Nine and Six** (i.e., the **Nine Stars of the Sun and Six Stars of the Moon**).\nIf one does not grasp the **mechanism of Heaven and Earth**,\nthen **True Lead** will scatter in an instant.\nThis must be carefully remembered.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving mastered the **principles of distillation and sublimation**,\nmust also know the **operations of the Cinnabar Furnace (河车)**.\nWhat is the **Cinnabar Furnace**?\nThere is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**,\nthe **Small Cinnabar Furnace**,\nand the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.\nThe **Cinnabar Furnace** is the **orthodox Qi of the North**,\nconstantly revolving,\nencompassing the **beginning of yin and yang**,\nand **matching odd and even pairs** in succession.\nInternally, it **concentrates the spirit**,\nthen **harvests medicines from Nature**,\nadvances **True Qi’s Fire**,\n**supplements mercury and extracts lead**,\nand this is the **first matter of the Small Cinnabar Furnace**.\nWhen one **passes the Three Passes with a single strike**,\ndirectly transcending to the **Inner Palace**,\n**retrieving and refining** the **posterior and anterior**,\n**nurturing the upper and lower**,\nwhile the **Great Elixir of the Yellow Court** gradually forms,\nthis is the **Great Cinnabar Furnace**.\n\nWhen the **Great and Small Cinnabar Furnaces** are both in operation,\nand the **art is fully realized**,\nthe **form and Qi are unharmed**,\nthe **Dao is harmonized**,\nthen it is called the **Purple Cinnabar Furnace**.\nWith these **Three Furnaces** mastered,\nall take meaning from the **operations of revolving**.\nThus, **refining the form**\nis the **art of Primordial Inner Observation (元内观)**,\nall within oneself.\n\nAll who study *The Yellow and White Scriptures*,\nhaving heard the **precepts and prohibitions**,\nmust **diligently uphold them**.\nTime passes swiftly like a flowing stream,\nand the **pills of Qi** and **form** dissipate,\nlike **burning flames melting into embers**.\nOnce the **flames are extinguished**,\nthey **must** be **quenched**.\nEach should **early exert their efforts**,\nso that the **Six Relatives** may harmonize,\nand one may **ascend to the Six Heavens**,\nwhile the **Nine Clans** receive blessings.\n\nFrom the **origin of the Qi and pulse pathways**,\none must **obtain the smooth path**.\nThe **Scriptures of the Immortals** are near—\neach should **strive earnestly**.」",

if **qi** does not generate, death follows.\nThus, the **lungs** must cover above, and the **spleen** must support below—this is the fundamental principle of the *Yellow Silk Scripture*.\nAt the hours of *zi* (11 PM–1 AM) and *wu* (11 AM–1 PM), visualize a child holding a yellow banner within the **spleen** and **lungs**.\nIf **white qi** appears, like wind stirring the banner,\nclose the breath and focus the mind—then all distractions will cease.\nThe five **zàng**-organs all nourish **essence** and **qi**, yet here the emphasis lies on the **spleen** and **lungs**.\nThe **heart** and **kidneys** are husband and wife,\nwhile the **spleen** and **lungs** are mother and child.\nOnly after mother and child nourish each other does the father-son relationship arise—thus the **liver** generates, and the **liver** gives birth to the **heart**.\nThe **heart** is the sovereign; thus, this is the **Dao** of lord and minister, preserved in sequence.\n\nHeaven is high, Earth is low; the three **yin** and three **yang** circulate within.\nIn one’s body, **yin** and **yang qi** flow through.\nHarmony brings peace; imbalance brings illness.\nThus, when cold or heat overpowers, it becomes *nuè* (malaria-like fever) or *lì* (severe cold).\nIf **yang qi** is excessive while **yin** is suppressed, it becomes *lì*.\nIf **yang qi** is suppressed while **yin** is excessive, it becomes *wēn* (epidemic disease).\nIf **yang qi** is stagnant and does not circulate, it becomes *jū* (ulcerous sores).\nIf blood and **qi** are blocked, it becomes *yǒu* (a wasting disease).\nAll these manifest as bear-like afflictions, threatening life itself.\n\nMany know how illness harms, yet few grasp cultivation to achieve longevity.\nThey see distant threats yet fail to observe those near at hand.\nIf you cover one eye, you cannot see.\nIf you pinch one ear, you cannot hear.\nIf you hold your breath, internal **qi** cannot escape.\nIf you sneeze, external **qi** cannot enter.\nUnderstanding this, how can you doubt that focusing the mind and calling **qi** can bring harmony?\n\nOnly by mastering focused contemplation and **qi**-invocation can one grasp the *Yellow Silk Scripture*’s true essence.\nWhat is the true essence?\nAll else is not the true essence.\nThe eyes perceive color, the ears hear sound, the nose smells fragrance, the mouth tastes flavor—\nlust for clothing, money, or filth; or entanglement in debauchery and deceit—\nall arise from imagination.\nIf you focus correctly, what you attain will also be effortless.\nThus, the **Dao** of *Yellow Silk Scripture* is easier than pursuing the pleasures of the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.\nThose who attain this **Dao** will prevail.\n\nWhat does it mean to prevail?\nNo one does not desire longevity, yet this method can grant it.\nNo one does not desire divinity, yet this method can achieve it.\nThus, the **Dao** of longevity and immortality lies not in idle thought but in focused contemplation to align with the true essence.\n\nThe **Dao** is without contemplation or action.\nWithout contemplation does not mean one never contemplates—\ncontemplation is the rectification of nature.\nWithout action does not mean one never acts—\naction is the fulfillment of principle.\nIf one insists on \"without contemplation,\" they are no better than beasts.\nIf one insists on \"without action,\" they are no better than stone.\nTo mistake beasts and stone for the **Dao**, saying,\n*\"I have no contemplation; I have no action,\"*\nis false.\n\nNow, if a person sits in a grand hall,\nfire rising from above—they will flee;\nwater overflowing from below—they will flee.\nIf they do not flee, it is because they discern whether the threat is true or false.\nIf they can discern correctly, they must say:\n*\"Fire and water approach, threatening my life—I must flee!\"*\nYet if the **Dao** is claimed to be without contemplation or action,\nwhile also relying on focused visualization and **qi**-invocation,\nthis is a contradiction—and it is not so.\n\nThus, the mind feels, the spirit condenses, the **qi** interacts, and sincerity is achieved.\nWhat is *feeling*?\nIt is responding to sound.\nWhat is *condensing*?\nIt is focusing on one thing and becoming still.\nWhat is *interacting*?\nIt is stillness that allows interaction.\nWhat is *achieving*?\nIt is interaction that brings fulfillment.\n\nFor the silent morning audience method of communicating with the heavens,\nthis principle applies—then the soul and spirit will not wander,\nand the audience will not be lost.\nIf, during this time, a boy stands beside you,\nstriking the *zhèng* (metallophone) or walking in empty space,\nand your spirit rises with the sound,\nthen upon returning, it will also seek the sound—\nthis is the supreme method.\n\nThese techniques vary widely, yet beyond them lies an essential truth.\nNow, many cultivate the **Dao** and seek the spirit,\nyet they only refine **yin qi**—like the *Yuángāng* (primordial **qi**) walking method.\nWithin *Yuángāng*, there is also the method of **yang qi**.\nDirectly within the physical form, its benefits are immediate,\nthough refining **yin qi** for ten years is still difficult.\nMethods like the *Rìyuè Jié Lún Gāoběn* (sun-moon purification of the essence’s foundation) are **yang**-based,\nrequiring deep familiarity—if not, one will be attached to other practices.\n\nFew can ascend and transform, yet many can shed their bones.\nAt the moment of shedding bones,\none must be thoroughly familiar with the *Yuángāng* walking method,\nthe palace courts and morning audiences,\nand the proper responses to the celestial throne.\nIgnorance here will invite the *Luóxiá* (demons) and a hundred ghosts\nto deceive and ensnare you within the realm.\nOnly those who recognize this danger will succeed.",

originally arise from the fragrance of fine aromas and filth.\nThus, before tasting fine aromas or filth,\none assumes they do not enter the body,\nbelieving that swallowing and vomiting come from

other things exist,\nthe flowers outside the chamber\nare unseen within.\nYet when one closely contemplates the flowers before them,\nthe floral scene appears before the eyes.\nThus, the Celestial Palace and Underworld\nenter clearly through false perception.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nThe desire between male and female\narises from yin and yang.\nWithin yin and yang,\nthe distinction of male and female emerges.\nA beautiful husband and ugly wife—\nthough they do not please each other;\nA beautiful wife and ugly husband—\nit is the same.\nThe difference between beauty and ugliness\nlies in the male and female distinction.\nSome find each other pleasing,\nothers do not—\nthus, the desire of male and female\nis like beauty and ugliness.\nThe perception of beauty and ugliness\ndoes not depend on male and female.\nOnce, a blind man\ncoupled with an ugly woman,\nyet found her as beautiful as a fair one.\nThus, the perception of beauty and ugliness\nis like the distinction of male and female.\nTherefore, the so-called male and female distinction\nis irrelevant.\nThe mind’s desire for beauty arises from lust,\nlust arises from lewdness,\nand lewdness’s fluids intermingle,\nrooted in false perception.\nControlled by false perception,\nthe essence is not true—\nthis is called *Jingming* (Pure Clarity).\n\nYellow Silk says:\nFluids arise from the mind,\nthe mind arises from fluids—\nthe thought of mind and fluids\nis where they originate.\nThe fluids of tears and mucus,\nthe kinship of flesh and bone.\nWhen the close one dies,\none weeps before seeing them.\nWhen the distant one dies,\none covers their nose and passes by.\nThough tears and mucus are one,\nproximity and distance lie in the mind.\nThe mind’s thought generates fluids,\nfluids transform into tears and mucus.\n\nYellow Silk says:\nTo be steadfast and responsive—\nsteadfastness is unity.\nResponsiveness is thought.\nUnity in what is contemplated\nis the true and real.\nThe *qi* within the mind\noriginates from the formless.\nThe bone at the crown\nis form and thus firm.\nThe thought of the body’s *qi*\nshatters this firm bone.\nBone is black, void within—\nbone opens due to *qi*.\n*Qi*

never existed.\nWhat thought touches\nresults in the bone’s opening and closing.\nWhen *qi* attacks,\nthe body’s firmness and *qi*’s completeness—\nwhy could they not be one?\nGuiding and drawing *qi*
