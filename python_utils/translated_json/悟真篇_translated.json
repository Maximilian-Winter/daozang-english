  "full_translation": "**Preface to *Awakening to Reality***\n\nAlas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away with ease. Who can fathom the span of life or escape the retribution of karma? If one does not awaken in time, content merely to await the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads will plunge one into the three evil destinies, where eons may pass without hope of deliverance. When that time comes, though one may repent, what use will it be?\n\nThus, the sages of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means in the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate the seed of transcendence and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect comprehension, one may directly cross to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to conditioned existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one may ascend to sagehood in an instant. But if one fails to awaken to the original nature, one remains mired in the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains sayings on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny, while the *Analects* speaks of \"having no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no ego\"—these are Confucius’ profoundest insights into the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words so often brief and lacking in detail? It is because he sought to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—all active endeavors. Thus, he never explicitly expounded the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of destiny within the images of the *Changes* and mingled the methods of nature within his subtle words.\n\nAs for *Zhuangzi*, who exhaustively explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi* of integrity—both came close to the crux of the matter. Later, during the Han, Wei Boyang drew upon the *Changes* to elucidate the principle of yin-yang union in the *Can Tong Qi*, clarifying the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of the Loyal Lineage, in the preface to his recorded sayings, expounded the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the root and branches of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?\n\nYet how lamentable that later generations of Daoist and Buddhist practitioners, each clinging to their own sect, have disparaged one another, causing the essential purport of the three traditions to be lost amid heterodox paths, unable to merge and return to unity!\n\nMoreover, people today assume that the Daoist path emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two: those that are easily encountered but difficult to perfect, and those that are difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the Five Sprouts, absorbing the radiance of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and chanting talismans, clicking the teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating the spirit and holding the breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, or practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining minerals, herbs, and other substances—all belong to the category of what is easily encountered but difficult to perfect.\n\nThe above methods, in their approach to cultivating the body, are generally fragmented and incomplete. Though one may expend great effort, no verifiable results are obtained. If one diligently applies oneself with bitter resolve, practicing day and night, one may at best avoid illness and prevent untimely misfortune. Yet if one ceases practice even for a day, previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such methods merely prolong the years without hope of true accomplishment. How can one expect to attain permanence, reverse aging, transform the body, and ascend in flight? It is truly pitiable!\n\nMost practitioners in recent times cling to delusions and fail to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, instead blaming the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages concealed the truth beneath a veil of symbolic names. Among these methods, only breath-holding resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles: if one can forget scheming and still the mind, one may enter samadhi and project the spirit. Yet the spirit belongs to yin, and the dwelling of the body is hard to stabilize, necessitating constant migration. Without mastering the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones, transform the yang, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir, by contrast, is difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the Jade Crucible simmers, and the Golden Furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this may be accomplished in a brief moment, yet it secures boundless ease and joy for eternity.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing the upright and maintaining fullness, the key lies in embracing the feminine and holding to the One. Naturally, the *qi* of yang rebirth arises, and the form of yin dissolution is shed. Once the nodal phases are complete, one casts off the womb and transforms the spirit, the name is inscribed in the immortal register, and the title of Perfected One is conferred—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, designate the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidneys into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, employ spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and grasp fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they fathom the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang interpenetrating?\n\nAll this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returned Elixir? It is truly difficult!\n\nFrom youth, I have been fond of the Dao and traversed the scriptures of the Three Teachings, extending even to legal codes, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and misfortune, life and death—nothing has escaped my careful study. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, silver and lead, *li* and *kan* as male and female, capable of forming the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir. None, however, reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor do they explain the methods of fire phases, the measures of refinement, or the aims of nurturing and preservation.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded practitioners, indulging their fanciful interpretations, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancients, introducing myriad errors and distortions.\n\nNot only have they thrown the immortal classics into chaos, but they have also led later students astray. As for myself, having never encountered a perfected one nor received oral instructions, I grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withering away. Though I sought answers across mountains and seas, consulting both the wise and the foolish, none could truly comprehend the essential teaching or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* reign (1069), while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my unwavering resolve and deep sincerity moved a true immortal to bestow upon me the secret instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and fire phases. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—pointing to the stream to reveal the source, speaking one to awaken a hundred. Like mist dispersing to reveal the sun’s brilliance, or dust settling to expose a mirror’s clarity, they aligned with the immortal classics as if matching tally tokens.\n\nI observed that of those who pursue immortality, eight or nine in ten do so; yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essence. Having received this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it? I poured forth all I had gained, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them are sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, reflecting the number of the two eights; sixty-four jueju, arranged according to the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*; one five-character verse, symbolizing the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully expounded the hierarchy of the crucible, the weights of the ingredients, the progression and retreat of the fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the interplay of existence and non-existence, and the auspices of fortune and misfortune.\n\nYet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and securing the body, leaving the original awakening of the true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs had attained enlightenment through a bamboo’s strike. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I appended to the end of the scroll. Here, at last, the Way of realizing the fundamental and illuminating the nature is made complete.\n\nMay those of shared aspiration who read this perceive the root through the branches and abandon delusion to follow the real.\n\n**Scroll One: Sixteen Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**(Marking the count of two eights and one jin)**\n\n**I**\nNot seeking the great Dao to escape delusion’s way,\nThough burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of life—spark struck from stone,\nA lifetime’s fate—bubble afloat on water.\nOnly craving fame and profit, chasing glory’s sheen,\nUnheeding how the form withers, darkly sere and dry.\nAsk then: though gold be piled like mountains high,\nCan impermanence be bought to grant a single \"no\"?\n\n**II**\nThough man’s life may span a hundred years,\nShort or long, poverty or ease—none can foreknow.\nYesterday through streets he galloped proud,\nToday in coffin lies his sleeping shroud.\nWife and wealth abandoned, no longer his to hold,\nKarmic deeds advance—no self-deceit can hide.\nIf the great elixir is not sought, how chance to meet?\nMeeting yet not refining—foolish folly indeed.\n\n**III**\nTo learn immortality, learn the Heavenly Immortal’s way,\nFor only the Golden Vessel is most true and sure.\nWhen the two meet, nature and feeling unite,\nWhere the Five Phases are whole, tiger and dragon coil.\nOriginally through *xu* and *ji* they wed as matchmakers,\nThus husband and wife in joyous union stay.\nAwaiting only merit’s completion to ascend the Jade Towers,\nAmid ninefold rosy clouds, riding the auspicious radiance.\n\n**IV**\nThree, five, one—three characters in all,\nFrom ancient times to now, few truly understand.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five,\nNorth’s one and west’s four share the same.\n*Xu* and *ji* dwell in the generative number five,\nWhen the three families meet, the infant is conceived.\nThe infant is the One, containing true qi,\nTen months’ gestation complete—entering the sage’s foundation.\n\n**V**\nGrasses and trees, yin and yang—both must align,\nIf one is lacking, no fragrance will rise.\nFirst unfurl green leaves, yang taking the lead,\nThen bloom red blossoms, yin following after.\nThe common way is but this in daily use,\nYet who knows the true source’s reversal and return?\nI say to all who study the Dao:\nWithout knowing yin and yang, do not act in vain.\n\n**VI**\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness,\nCultivating one alone leaves the body frail.\nExhausting form with exercises—none is the Dao,\nIngesting qi, dining on mist—all is madness.\nThe world vainly seeks lead and mercury’s taming,\nWhen will they witness tiger and dragon’s descent?\nI urge you: exhaustively seek your birth’s origin,\nReturning to the root, restoring the source—this is the Medicine King.\n\n**VII**\nEvery person possesses the elixir of long life,\nYet deluded fools cast it aside in vain.\nWhen sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite,\nWhere yellow sprouts arise, *kan* and *li* intertwine.\nThe well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists,\nThe hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.\nWhen the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house of itself—\nWhy seek herbs to burn and thatch?\n\n**VIII**\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits,\nSeeking myriad herbs is not the true way.\nYin and yang, matched in kind, return to mutual resonance,\nTwo eights in balance naturally unite as kin.\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun’s red dispels yin’s specters,\nOn the mountain’s peak, the moon’s white brings fresh elixir sprouts.\nIf men would know true lead and mercury,\nThey are not mere cinnabar or quicksilver.\n\n**IX**\nThis method is true, yet within it truer still,\nFor it arises from my singular difference from others.\nI know the inversion comes from *li* and *kan*,\nBut who discerns the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,\nThe jade pool first receives silver from water.\nThe divine work of firing is not a day’s labor—\nBehold: in the deep pool, a single moon’s wheel appears.\n\n**X**\nTo know where the medicine’s river-source arises,\nThe moon in the southwest is its native land.\nWhen lead meets *gui*’s birth, swiftly gather it,\nGold at full moon’s distance is not fit to taste.\nSend it to the earthen crucible, seal fast,\nThen into flowing pearls let them pair and unite.\nThe medicine weighs two jin—two eights required,\nHarmonizing fire and timing, entrusting to yin and yang.\n\n**XI**\nTiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,\nAt the center’s rightful place, the mysterious pearl is born.\nFruit on the branch awaits ripening in time,\nThe child in the womb—how could it be different?\nNorth and south schools reverse the hexagrams’ signs,\nDawn and dusk’s firing accords with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace—\nWhy must one guard solitude in deep mountains?\n\n**XII**\nNot knowing the inversion within the mysterious,\nHow can one plant lotuses in fire?\nLead the White Tiger home to rear,\nBear a bright pearl round as the moon.\nVainly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing,\nSimply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting to nature.\nWhen the host of yin is wholly stripped away, the cinnabar ripens,\nLeaping from the cage to live ten thousand years.\n\n**XIII**\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find,\nBut the adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.\nThe Four Images and Five Phases wholly depend on earth,\nThe Three Primes and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave *ren*?\nRefining into the numinous treasure is hard to recognize,\nDissolving yin’s demons, ghosts dare not invade.\nWishing to leave secret formulas among men,\nYet not one encounter proves a knowing friend.\n\n**XIV**\nDiligently seek true lead with intent,\nLest time slip by too easily.\nSimply capture earth’s *po* to tame cinnabar’s mercury,\nNaturally heaven’s *hun* will subdue water’s gold.\nThis may be called Dao so lofty dragons and tigers submit,\nWorthy of saying virtue so weighty ghosts and spirits revere.\nAlready knowing life spans equal heaven and earth,\nNo cause for affliction to rise in the heart.\n\n**XV**\nNot recognizing true lead as the primal ancestor,\nAll efforts applied are but wasted toil.\nRenouncing wives vainly severs yin and yang,\nFasting empties the bowels—all in vain.\nGrasses and trees, yin and yang—all are dregs,\nClouds and mist, sun and moon—belong to the turbid.\nEven adding breathing exercises and visualization,\nAll differ from the work of the golden elixir.\n\n**XVI**\nTen thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures speak the same,\nThe Golden Vessel alone is the root and source.\nRelying on *kun*’s position to form the body,\nPlanted in *qian*’s house, the organs of resonance.\nMarvel not that the celestial mechanism is wholly revealed,\nOnly because scholars are all benighted and dull.\nIf one can grasp the meaning within these verses,\nAt once they will meet the Three Purities’ Most High Lord.\n\n**Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**(By Hexagram and Number)**\n\n**I**\nThe Dao from emptiness gives birth to the primal qi,\nFrom this single qi arise yin and yang.\nYin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,\nThe Three Bodies engender the flourishing of the ten thousand things.\n\n**II**\nThe ten thousand things, teeming, each return to the root;\nReturning to the root and reviving life is everlasting.\nTo know constancy and return to the origin—few comprehend,\nWhile reckless action invites misfortune, as all have heard.\n\n**III**\nSimply take the gate of death as the gate of life,\nDo not cling to the gate of life and call it the gate of death.\nIf one grasps the mechanism of killing and reversal,\nOnly then will one know that harm conceals grace.\n\n**IV**\nFortune and misfortune from of old intertwine,\nLike echo and shadow following one another.\nIf one can turn this mechanism of life and death,\nDisaster transforms to blessing in the space between palm and hand.\n\n**V**\nTo secure the Valley Spirit and never die,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\nOnce true essence returns to the golden chamber,\nA single luminous pearl will never depart.\n\n**VI**\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world,\nDo not mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose.\nEven with a thousand years of breathing exercises,\nHow can one seize the golden horse and grapple the hare?\n\n**VII**\nFew know that different names arise from the same source,\nThese two mysteries within mysteries are the essential mechanism.\nTo preserve life and perfect form, discern gain and loss—\nThe purple-gold elixir is most wondrous and rare.\n\n**VIII**\nNot recognizing yin and yang, nor host and guest,\nHow can one know which is distant and which is near?\nIn the chamber, vainly sealing the Gate of Tailbone,\nHow many in Jambudvīpa have been led to ruin?\n\n**IX**\nFirst observe heaven to understand the Five Thieves,\nNext examine earth to pacify the people.\nOnly when the people are at peace and the state prosperous should one wage war,\nAfter war’s end can the sage be seen.\n\n**X**\nIn deployment, distinguish left and right armies,\nThough they may be host and I the guest.\nI urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,\nLest you lose our priceless treasure.\n\n**XI**\nThe Three Powers plunder one another in their time,\nThis is the mechanism of the immortals’ virtue and power.\nOnce the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nThe hundred bones are all ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\n**XII**\nThe *Yinfu*’s treasured words exceed three hundred,\nThe *Daode*’s numinous script fills five thousand.\nImmortals of past and present are without number,\nYet all from this point reach the true essence.\n\n**XIII**\nThe *Cantong Qi*, scriptures, and songs expound the utmost truth,\nYet fire-phases are not set down in writing.\nTo know the oral instructions that penetrate the mystery,\nOne must discuss them carefully with an immortal.\n\n**XIV**\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a teacher’s transmission, do not force guesses.\nFor elixir scriptures lack oral instructions,\nWhere then can you congeal the numinous embryo?\n\n**XV**\nDreaming of thirst, I ascended Xihua to the nine heavens,\nWhere a perfected one bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan* chapter.\nIts essentials are few, with little speech,\nOnly teaching one to refine mercury and lead.\n\n**XVI**\nDo not use common lead—use true lead,\nYet even true lead, once used, must be discarded.\nThis is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:\nTo use lead is not to use it—this is the truth.\n\n**XVII**\nWhen bamboo is split, it must be mended with bamboo;\nTo hatch a chicken, one must use an egg.\nAll other methods are vain toil,\nHow can they compare to true lead, which contains the sacred mechanism?\n\n**XVIII**\nDo not hide in the mountains before refining the returning elixir,\nFor all before and after in the mountains is not lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.\n\n**XIX**\n\"Empty the heart and fill the belly\"—both meanings run deep,\nBut to empty the heart, one must first know the heart.\nBetter to refine lead and first fill the belly,\nThen guard the hall filled with gold.\n\n**XX**\nThe sun dwelling in *Li*’s position becomes female,\nThe moon paired with the Toad Palace is male.\nIf one does not grasp this inversion,\nDo not presume to speak of lofty matters with limited insight.\n\n**XXI**\nThe *Zhen* dragon’s mercury emerges from *Li*’s land,\nThe *Dui* tiger’s gold is born in *Kan*’s direction.\nThese two things arise as the child produces the mother,\nThe Five Phases must all enter the center.\n\n**XXII**\nIf *Li* and *Kan* lack *Xu* and *Ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly because each holds true earth,\nCan the golden elixir return and revert.\n\n**XXIII**\nFire born of wood inherently conceals its edge,\nWithout understanding, do not forcefully drill.\nDisaster arises from this—it harms oneself,\nOne must subdue it to seek the Metal Lord.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Metal Lord is originally the Eastern House’s son,\nSent to dwell in the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.\nIf you recognize and summon him to return and nurture,\nPair him with the Maiden to forge a bond.\n\n**XXV**\nThe Maiden wanders in all directions,\nHer forward path must be short, her rearward long.\nReturning, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nTo wed the Metal Lord as her old husband.\n\n**XXVI**\nTake the solid center from *Kan*’s position,\nTo transmute the yin within *Li*’s palace.\nFrom this, it transforms into *Qian*’s vigorous body,\nHidden or soaring—all is governed by the heart.\n\n**XXVII**\nFirst take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible and vessel,\nNext gather the hare and crow to cook the medicine.\nOnce these two are driven into the Yellow Path,\nHow can the golden vessel fail to be born?\n\n**XXVIII**\nEstablish the furnace and set up the vessel according to *Qian* and *Kun*,\nRefine the essence to subdue the po and hun.\nGathering and dispersing, misty and dense, they transform,\nDare one treat such mysteries as trivial?\n\n**XXIX**\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,\nOnly with medicine can creation and transformation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks a true seed,\nIt is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.\n\n**XXX**\nEven if you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the fire-phases, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends entirely on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of delay, and the elixir will not form.\n\n**XXXI**\nBlack containing white is the elixir’s mother,\nYang concealing yin is the sacred embryo.\nThe Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care,\nThe Three Fields gather treasures like the Three Terraces.\n\n**XXXII**\nWithin the indistinct, seek the image,\nWithin the profound darkness, find the true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being mutually enter,\nWithout seeing, how can one imagine it complete?\n\n**XXXIII**\nThe eldest son suddenly drinks wine from the west,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms flowers in the north.\nOnce the Green Maiden meets him,\nAll is sealed at once in the Yellow House.\n\n**XXXIV**\nOn Mount Hua’s peak, the male tiger roars,\nIn Fusang’s sea, the female dragon sings.\nThe Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,\nSending them to become husband and wife with one heart.\n\n**XXXV**\nThe White Tiger of the Western Mountain rages,\nThe Green Dragon of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,\nTransforming into a sheet of purple-gold frost.\n\n**XXXVI**\nThe Red Dragon and Black Tiger, each in west and east,\nThe Four Images intersect in *Xu* and *Ji*.\n\n**XXXVII**\nSince filth is now transformed to function,\nWho says the golden elixir cannot be achieved?\n\n**XXXVIII**\nThe moon at heaven’s edge, half a wheel bright,\nAlready the dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar arise.\nBest now to refine the dual eights with diligence,\nWithin one double-hour the elixir is complete.\n\n**XXXIX**\nResplendent, the golden elixir forms in a day—\nThe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nThose who speak of nine years or three years\nAre merely procrastinating to extend their days.\n\n**XL**\nStriking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow jade mushrooms,\nStrumming the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife’s measure.\nOf late, golden light shines through the body,\nNo longer speaking of these principles to ordinary folk.\n\n**XLI**\nWithin the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout,\nIn the cinnabar tripod, mercury lies level.\nOnly after the fire’s force is harmonized\nDoes the yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\n**XLII**\nDo not cling to the labor of the elixir hearth—\nTo refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.\nThere exists a natural true fire’s season;\nWhy rely on kindling or forced breath?\n\n**XLIII**\nBetween the waning and waxing moon’s phases,\nThe medicine’s flavor is balanced, its qi complete.\nOnce gathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,\nForged and nurtured as if simmering fresh delicacies.\n\n**XLIV**\nIn the hare and rooster’s months, at their appointed time,\nPunishment and virtue arrive at the gate—such is the medicine’s image.\nAt this point, the golden elixir should be bathed;\nIf fire is added, it will surely topple into danger.\n\n**XLV**\nOu Ye personally transmitted the sword-forging method,\nMoye’s metal and water tempered softness and hardness.\nOnce refined, it understands human intent,\nSlaying demons a thousand miles away in a flash of lightning.\n\n**XLVI**\nHarmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir,\nNeither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.\nIf one asks where true lead is found,\nThe toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.\n\n**XLVII**\nOn the fifteenth of the eighth month, admiring the toad’s glow,\nIt is precisely when the golden essence is robust and flourishing.\nWhen the first yang arises in revival,\nOne may then advance the fire without delay.\n\n**XLVIII**\nAs soon as the first yang stirs to begin the elixir,\nThe lead tripod glows warmly behind the curtain.\nAt the moment of receiving qi, it is easily recognized,\nBut in drawing and adding, tending the fire, guard against peril.\n\n**XLIX**\nSun and moon meet once every thirty days,\nExchanging time for days by the method of divine work.\nDefending the city or waging wild battles, knowing fortune and misfortune,\nOne gains numinous cinnabar filling the tripod with red.\n\n**L**\nThe mysterious pearl takes form as yang arises,\nYang at its peak, yin wanes, gradually stripping away form.\nIn the tenth month, frost flies, the elixir ripens,\nAt this time, even spirits and ghosts must be startled.\n\n**LI**\nAfter drinking at Jasper Pool, the moon’s radiance clears,\nMounting a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the assembled immortals,\nThe seas and fields, hills and valleys may shift at will.\n\n**LII**\nDo not exert clever deceit as effort,\nRecognize the other family’s deathless method.\nIn the gourd, swiftly add the wine of extended life,\nIn the tripod, gather the essence of returned souls.\n\n**LIII**\nSnow Mountain’s single flavor is the finest ghee,\nPoured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of transformation.\nIf it passes beyond Kunlun to the northwest,\nZhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\n\n**LIV**\nThunder roars, refining the golden-water method,\nFire erupts on Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.\nIf these two substances harmonize,\nNaturally the elixir matures, fragrance suffusing the body.\n\n**LV**\nTo know the method of refining and nurturing the returned elixir,\nOne must plant the seed in one’s own garden.\nWithout forced breath or exertion,\nNaturally the fruit ripens, the numinous embryo forms.\n\n**LVI**\nBefore refining the returned elixir, refine it swiftly;\nOnce refined, one must know when to stop and be content.\nIf one’s heart remains insatiable in holding abundance,\nOne will inevitably one day suffer distress and humiliation.\n\n**LVII**\nOnly after adversity and prosperity pass through myriad things’ fullness,\nDo difficulty and simplicity receive their seals, upholding generation.\nIn this, attaining the meaning, one must forget images;\nIf one exhaustively investigates the hexagrams, one vainly labors the emotions.\n\n**LVIII**\nThe hexagrams’ established methods are originally forms,\nAttaining the image, forgetting words, the intent becomes clear.\nThe deluded people of the world cling only to images,\nYet practice hexagram qi, hoping for ascension.\n\n**LIX**\nHeaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness have their times;\nOnly by discerning ebb and flow does one grasp the mechanism.\nFrom of old, *geng* and *jia* clarify the mandate,\nSlaying the Three Worms, the Dao may be attained.\n\n**LX**\nWhen the Four Images converge, the mysterious body is complete,\nWhere the Five Phases are whole, purple light shines.\nShedding the embryo, entering the mouth, one becomes divine and sagely,\nCountless divine dragons all lose their astonishment.\n\n**LXI**\nMedicine meets its kindred qi to form an image,\nThe Dao resides in emptiness, uniting with spontaneity.\nSwallowing a single grain of numinous elixir,\nOne then knows my life is not ruled by heaven.\n\n**LXII**\nThe great Dao’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,\nOne knows it depends on me, yet also on heaven.\nIf not for accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue,\nAt every move, hordes of demons would obstruct the path.\n\n**LXIII**\nOnly when the mind-monkey is stilled and the square-inch mechanism,\nThree thousand merits and deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally there is a tripod to refine dragon and tiger,\nWhy cling to home, yearning for children and wife?\n\n**LXIV**\nCultivation blends with the world, yet harmonizes its light,\nRound when round, square when square.\nConcealed or revealed, contrary or compliant, none can fathom,\nHow can one make others see one’s conduct and concealment?\n\n**Five-Character Quatrain (On the Image of the Supreme Unity)**\n*(Omitted as the original text cuts off mid-line.)*\n\nA maiden dons azure robes,\nA gentleman wears plain silk.\nSeen, they cannot be used;\nUsed, they cannot be seen.\nIn fleeting glimpses they meet,\nIn profound obscurity they transform.\nA flash—flame soars aloft,\nAnd the true adept appears.\n\n**Twelve *Xijiang yue* Lyrics**\n*(Xijiang yue: \"West River Moon.\" West is the direction of metal; river, the body of water; moon, the function of the elixir. Twelve lyrics to correspond with the twelve months of the year.)*\n\n**I**\nThe inner elixir mirrors the outer,\nThe inner flows free, the outer must likewise flow.\nThe cinnabar head blends in perfect accord,\nNurtured by twofold action, warm and gentle.\nWithin, the natural true fire,\nIn the crucible, blazing and ever red.\nThe outer furnace’s regulation demands diligence,\nFor nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.\n\n**II**\nThis elixir, most divine and sacred,\nYet your meager share is hard to dissolve.\nHarmonize lead and mercury without delay,\nSoon you’ll witness the form of the dark pearl.\nIf a steadfast seeker refines it,\nWhy not dwell in the marketplace or court?\nThe work is easy, the medicine not distant—\nRevealed, it moves one to laughter.\n\n**III**\nThe White Tiger’s first classic is a treasure,\nThe Flowery Pond’s divine water, true gold.\nKnow then that the highest good’s source runs deep,\nUnlike common medicinal substances.\nShould you seek to refine the ninefold cycle,\nFirst refine the self and hold fast the heart.\nFollow the time to gather, fix the floating and sinking,\nAdvance the fire, beware of grave peril.\n\n**IV**\nSeven returns—cinnabar reverts to its root,\nNine reversions—golden liquid returns to truth.\nDo not rely on the *yin* and *zi* to count *kun* and *shen*,\nBut observe the five phases’ completion as the standard.\nIt is but a single taste of mercury,\nCirculating through all the celestial stems.\nWhen yin and yang’s numbers are fulfilled, it attains the divine,\nEntering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.\n\n**V**\nThe Oxherd and Weaver Girl’s bond accords with the Dao,\nTortoise and Serpent naturally hold their endowments.\nThe Toad meets the new moon, joining in beauty,\nThe two qi mutually support and revolve.\nAll is the marvelous work of heaven and earth—\nWho grasps this true essence?\nWhen yin and yang are blocked and divided, it becomes a fault,\nHow then to attain heaven’s eternity and earth’s permanence?\n\n**VI**\nIf you would have true lead retain mercury,\nWithin the family, do not stray from the minister.\nWood and metal, though separated, have no cause to meet—\nA matchmaker must be employed to draw them together.\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s kindness.\nThey swallow and gulp each other, yet grow intimate,\nOnly then does the man conceive.\n\n**VII**\nWhose is the sixteen-year-old radiant maiden?\nWhere is the third dragon’s gentleman?\nThey call themselves Wood’s liquid and Metal’s essence,\nMeeting Earth, they form a third lineage.\nFurther refined by Ding’s forging,\nHusband and wife at last unite in joy.\nThe river chariot dares not pause even briefly,\nConveyed to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.\n\n**VIII**\nHeaven and earth have just passed through closure and opening,\nFrom dawn to dusk, know well the *zhun* and *meng*.\nSpokes gather at the hub, ever paying homage,\nThe wonder lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.\nAttain the One, and all affairs are complete—\nDo not divide north, south, east, or west.\nReduce and reduce again, guard your prior work,\nThe life-treasure must not be lightly toyed with.\n\n**IX**\nAt the winter solstice, the yang returns,\nEach thirty-day period adds a yang line.\nIn the moon’s *fu* hexagram, the new moon surpasses the dawn,\nAfter the full moon, the *qian* hexagram ends its omen.\nThe sun further divides cold and heat,\nYang arises again at midnight.\nAfter noon, one yin departs at dawn—\nRefining the elixir, know dusk and dawn.\n\n**X**\nIf you cannot distinguish the five phases and four images,\nHow can you tell cinnabar from mercury, lead from silver?\nBefore you’ve heard of the firing times for the elixir,\nYou rashly call yourself a great hermit.\nUnwilling to reflect on your own errors,\nYou even teach others your mistaken path.\nLeading them astray into eternal delusion,\nHow can you bear such deceit?\n\n**XI**\nWithin the male, the female essence resides,\nTrue yin embraces yang’s essence.\nWhen the two blend, the medicine is complete,\nTransmuting the hun, ling, po, and shen.\nTrust in the single grain of golden elixir—\nA serpent swallows it and instantly becomes a dragon.\nA chicken consumes it and transforms into a phoenix,\nSoaring into the sacred realm of true yang.\n\n**XII**\nVirtue’s cultivation surpasses eight hundred,\nHidden merits accumulate to three thousand.\nEqualizing self and others, kin and foe,\nOnly then does one fulfill the immortal’s original vow.\nThe tiger brother cannot harm you with blades,\nThe inconstant fire-house cannot entangle you.\nAfter the treasure talisman descends, you ascend to heaven,\nSteadily riding the simurgh’s chariot and phoenix’s carriage.\n\n**One Further Lyric**\n\n**(On the Intercalary Month as Symbol)**\nThe elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nFurther, on the nature, one investigates the true source,\nMastering the wondrous function of non-arising.\nNo need to await another life or future rebirth—\nIn this very moment, attain the Buddha’s divine powers.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this merit,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\n**Five Quatrains**\n*(On the Five Phases as Symbol)*\n\n**I**\nThough you comprehend the true suchness of nature,\nYou still must cast off the body and abandon the human form.\nWhy not also refine the great medicine,\nInstantly transcending the leakless to become a true person?\n\n**II**\nRebirth, possession-stealing, and relocation—\nThe old dwelling is but the fool of cause and effect.\nIf you master the subduing of the dragon and taming of the tiger,\nWhen will the house of true gold ever wither?\n\n**III**\nMirroring form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—\nAt first, the path is arduous; later, it becomes smooth.\nThough in an instant you may roam ten thousand lands,\nAlas, if the house is broken, you must still move.\n\n**IV**\nThe Śākya’s teaching urges cultivation of the Land of Bliss,\nOnly because the Land of Bliss is the golden realm.\nFor the most part, among forms and appearances, only this is real;\nThe other two are not true—vainly do they measure.\n\n**V**\nCommon sayings often speak of uniting with the supreme Dao,\nOne should seek within it with care.\nIf you can invert the ordinary in daily use,\nAll the dust and sand of the great earth become treasures.\n\n**Appendix: Reading the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***\nThe wondrous function of the great elixir follows Qian and Kun,\nAs Qian and Kun move, the Five Phases divide.\nWhen the Five Phases flow forward, the common Dao has arising and ceasing;\nWhen the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring.\nFrom the first sign in the formless,\nThe Two Modes arise from the One Root.\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies,\nThe Eight Trigrams mutually beget as parent and child.\nThe ten thousand images arise from change and movement,\nFortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—here they divide.\nThe common people use it daily yet do not know,\nThe sage alone can fathom its origin.\nThus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,\nAnd so it entrusts its image to this text.\nWhen Pi and Tai alternate, yin and yang now rise, now fall;\nWhen Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness are in morning and dusk.\nKan and Li are the male and female, water and fire;\nZhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, po and hun.\nAbiding in the center, the yellow skirt is supremely auspicious;\nEncountering Kang, there is no position, no honor.\nHaving not yet carefully observed the end and beginning of the ten thousand things,\nOne again meets with Gou, revealing the return of the two qi.\nThe moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit;\nThe sun’s rising and setting accord with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.\nThe words were established to clarify the image,\nOnce the image is grasped, the words are forgotten.\nIt is like setting up an image to point to the meaning—\nWhen the true meaning is realized, the image is discarded.\nThose who understand value simplicity and ease;\nThose who are deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.\nThus, the adept who cultivates the true\nShould not, in reading the *Cantong Qi*, cling to images or grasp at words.\n\n**Song for Master Liu of White Dragon Cave**\nJade flows, gold flies—the two luminaries rush,\nNo sooner do flowers bloom than autumn frost arrives.\nVainly do they boast of Peng Zu’s thousand years—\nIt is but a lightning flash in the clouds.\nA lightning flash—how fleeting!\nA hundred years amount to thirty thousand days,\nDuring which cold and heat alternately torment,\nUnnoticed, the youthful face fades in darkness.\nEven with children and grandchildren before your eyes,\nAffection and love only deepen the entanglement.\nWhen vitality is exhausted and the body withers,\nWho can devise a way to briefly delay?\nBriefly delay—yet there is no method,\nInevitably, the body returns to flowing water.\nJust look at the sages and worthies of old—\nHow many have managed to remain in the world?\nTo remain in the world—there is a way,\nOnly because people of this age lack the capacity.\nThey race into the mountains to seek herbs and trees,\nTo subdue lead and refine mercury, to congeal cinnabar.\nTo congeal cinnabar—this matter is far removed,\nOne must seek the crimson blood within Kan.\nSeize it, bring it to Li’s position to restrain yin essence,\nBlend and harmonize—there is a proper season.\nWhen the season is right, employ the matchmaker:\nThe Metal Elder and the Alchemical Maiden wed.\nThe Metal Elder prefers to ride the white tiger,\nThe Alchemical Maiden always mounts the red dragon’s body.\nThe tiger comes to sit quietly in the autumn mountains,\nThe dragon stirs in the depths of the pool.\nThe two beasts meet and battle,\nWaves surge and boil like a cauldron.\nThe Yellow Dame and Ding the Elder lend their numinous power,\nShaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.\nIn an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,\nA mysterious pearl is planted in the mud.\nFrom this, the root and sprout gradually grow,\nNurtured in season, embracing true essence.\nAfter ten months, the fetus is shed—swallow it,\nUnnoticed, the mortal body already possesses numinosity.\nThis matter—rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary people.\nIf in past lives you lacked the bone of immortality,\nHow could you easily encounter it?\nHaving encountered it—refine it at once,\nFor the light and shadow press on like an arrow.\nTo catch the fish, you must cast the net;\nDo not merely stand by the river and sigh in vain.\nI hear you have known the medicine for many years—\nWhy not gather your mind and refine mercury and lead?\nDo not let the candle be blown out by the wind,\nLest you blame heaven for the six paths of rebirth.\nLately, people in the world are full of deceit,\nAll donning Daoist robes and calling themselves adepts.\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute as if afflicted.\nYet they speak of refining qi and fasting,\nClaiming other schools and paths are long.\nHave you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?\nThe method of embracing the true within the Great One is most excellent.\nDo not fault my words for being wild and coarse—\nIt is only because people of this age are hard to discern.\nOnly when your heart is one with mine\nDare I pour out my thoughts to you.\n\n**Song of Stone Bridge**\nMy home lies north of Stone Bridge,\nWhere mountains guard and waters seal, ancient trees stand dense.\nBeneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,\nBelow the mountain, the spring’s drink is fragrant and rich.\nMy dwelling within the mountains is truly worthy of praise,\nEverywhere, I plant the unadorned flower.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave harbors a fierce tiger,\nEmerging from its den, it roars, stirring wind and mist.\nSouth of the mountain, the pool’s depths hide a flood dragon,\nRising in clouds, it descends rain, veiling the peaks in haze.\nThe two beasts meet and battle,\nThe primal pearl lies hidden—an auspicious sign.\nThe scene is enviable—I secretly rejoice,\nPouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nIts notes, one by one, teach with care.\nAlas, in drunkenness, none understand,\nMuddled and silent, as if foolish.\nGazing upward, I observe the marvelous workings of creation—\nThe sun still sets in the west, the moon still rises in the east.\n\nHeaven is earth, earth is heaven,\nInversion and reversion of yin and yang accord with nature.\nDiscern where the Five Phases reverse and overturn,\nAnd you shall ascend in rosy clouds to the Grotto-Heaven.\n\nA golden chamber, jade rafters,\nJade maidens and golden lads attend before you day and night.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,\nThe myriad phenomena manifest boundlessly.\n\nNo day nor night, only ceaseless continuity,\nGathering and dispersing, drawing and adding—fire and timing complete.\nShould you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,\nSeek a master to reveal the lead within the water.\n\nWood engenders fire, metal engenders water,\nWater and fire must distinguish fore and aft ranks.\nTo discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,\nLead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.\n\nThere is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,\nKnow contentment, ever content, return to the root.\nThe myriad spirits all celebrate the era of Great Peace,\nWhen the nation prospers and the people rejoice.\n\nThis matter is well worth pondering,\nThose of the same Dao know this truth.\nLater generations who study the cultivation of reality\nSpeak only of preserving and nurturing, of circulating qi.\nBefore your eyes, it seems so easy,\nYet those who attain it are wondrous beyond compare.\nFirst, it banishes illness and extends years,\nThen, through firing and refining, transforms the body into yang.\n\nLearners of the Dao, turn your thoughts inward,\nDo not inquire of side doors or minor methods.\nThey know only how to deceive others in the moment,\nUnaware that their own bodies wither in obscurity.\n\nI urge later students to be bold and resolute,\nDo not idly abandon home to dwell in distant lands.\nThe wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,\nHow could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?\n\nDo not procrastinate, do not indulge in baseness,\nHasten to seek a master and grasp the primordial intent.\nIf in this life you do not study and cultivate,\nWho knows what womb you may enter in the next?\n\nIf you have the heart, persevere to the end,\nFor the great matter of life is none other than birth and death.\nIf Heaven should betray one of Daoist heart,\nI would be consigned to the three evil paths as a lowly ghost.\n\n*Awakening to the True Nature School*\n*Four Quatrains*\n\nThe Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades the Ganges’ sands,\nThe myriad phenomena stand in serried ranks, unobstructed.\nWhen you comprehend the true Dharma-eye of perfect interpenetration,\nYou will know the three realms are your home.\n\nGazing, you cannot see its form,\nYet when you call, it responds.\nDo not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—\nIf there were no valley, what sound would there be?\n\nOne thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing,\nFor all dust-bound realms reveal its mechanism.\nYet even this wondrous one thing is not truly existent—\nOn what do the four depend?\n\nWithout moving a step, you reach the Western Heaven,\nFor all directions sit plainly before your eyes.\nThe light behind your neck is still illusion,\nClouds beneath your feet do not make you immortal.\n\n*Eulogy on the Nature-Ground*\n\nBuddha-nature is neither same nor different,\nA thousand lamps share one light.\nAdd to it—can you truly augment?\nSubtract from it—can you truly diminish?\nTaking and forsaking both pass without fault,\nBurning and drowning cause no harm.\nThe dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—\nNot one can be fathomed.\n\n*Eulogy on Arising and Ceasing*\n\nSeeking birth, it is originally unborn,\nFearing cessation, it has never briefly ceased.\nEyes see, yet do not compare to ears hearing,\nMouth speaks, yet how does it rival the nose’s telling?\n\n*Eulogy on the Three Realms as Mind Alone*\n\nThe three realms are the wondrous principle of mind alone,\nThe myriad things are neither this nor that.\nNot one thing is not my mind,\nNot one thing is my self.\n\n*Eulogy on Seeing the Mind in All Things*\n\nSee the thing, and you see the mind,\nWithout things, the mind does not appear.\nWithin the ten directions’ passage and obstruction,\nThe true mind is all-pervading.\nIf you give rise to intellectual understanding,\nYou fall into inverted views.\nWhen you behold phenomena without mind,\nOnly then do you see the bodhi face.\n\n*Eulogy on Equalizing Things*\n\nI am not different from others,\nYet others’ minds differ from mine.\nPeople have near and far,\nI have no this or that.\nBeasts of land and water, birds in flight—\nI regard them as one body.\nNoble and base, high and low,\nAre like hands and feet to me.\nI am not even I,\nHow could there be a you?\nWhen both this and that are gone,\nAll bubbles return to water.\n\n*Eulogy on the Mind Here and Now as Buddha*\n\nBuddha is mind, mind is Buddha,\nYet mind and Buddha have always been illusory things.\nIf you know there is no Buddha and no mind,\nOnly then is this the Dharmakāya Buddha.\n\nThe Dharmakāya Buddha has no form,\nA single orb of radiance contains the myriad phenomena.\nThe formless form is the true form,\nThe signless sign is the true sign.\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,\nNeither movement nor stillness, nor coming nor going.\nNo difference, no sameness, no being, no non-being,\nHard to grasp, hard to relinquish, hard to hear or hope for.\nWithin and without, round and bright, everywhere interpenetrating,\nOne Buddha-land lies within a single grain of sand.\nOne grain of sand contains the great thousandfold world,\nOne body and mind are ten thousand in unison.\nTo know this, you must master the mindless Dharma,\nUnstained and unobstructed—this is pure karma.\nGood and evil, a thousand kinds, yet nothing is done,\nThis is the true meaning of *namo* and Mahākāśyapa.\n\n*Eulogy on the Mindless*\n\nHow laughable, my mind—\nStubborn and coarse.\nStolid and drifting,\nIt entrusts things to their own course.\nIt does not understand cultivation,\nNor does it commit offenses.\nIt does not benefit others,\nNor does it seek for itself.\nIt does not uphold precepts,\nNor does it observe taboos.\nIt knows nothing of rites and music,\nNor does it practice benevolence and righteousness.\nOf all human abilities,\nIt has mastered not one.\nWhen hungry, it eats;\nWhen thirsty, it drinks.\nWhen tired, it sleeps;\nWhen awake, it walks.\nWhen hot, it wears light clothes;\nWhen cold, it covers itself.\nWithout thought, without worry,\nWhat sorrow? What joy?\nNo regret, no scheming,\nNo thought, no intent.\nAll worldly glory and shame\nAre but a travelers’ inn.\nBirds roosting in trees and woods\nMay be likened to this.\nComing, it does not forbid;\nGoing, it does not stop.\nIt neither avoids nor seeks,\nNeither praises nor blames.\nIt does not loathe the ugly,\nNor does it admire the beautiful.\nIt does not hasten to quiet chambers,\nNor does it shun bustling markets.\nIt does not speak of others’ faults,\nNor does it boast of its own rightness.\nIt does not favor the noble,\nNor does it slight the lowly.\nLoved ones and enemies,\nGreat and small, inner and outer—\nSorrow and joy, gain and loss,\nReverence and contempt, peril and ease—\nThe mind does not regard them as two,\nBut meets all with equanimity.\nIt does not strive for blessings first,\nNor does it initiate calamity.\nIt responds only when moved,\nAnd rises again when pressed.\nIt does not fear blades,\nHow could it fear tigers?\nIt follows things in their naming,\nWhy cling to labels?\nThe eye does not pursue forms,\nSounds do not enter the ear.\nAll that has appearance\nIs but delusion and falsehood.\nMale and female forms and voices\nAre not fixed entities.\nForms and appearances are mindless,\nUnstained and unobstructed.\nFree and at ease,\nNothing can burden it.\n\nThe wondrous awakening shines perfectly, illuminating both within and without.\nIt envelops the six directions, without near or far.\nThis light is not light—like the moon reflected in water.\nTo grasp or reject it is difficult; what comparison could suffice?\nUnderstanding this wondrous function, one transcends all bounds.\n\nSomeone asked of its essence—it is only this.\n\n**Heart Sutra Verse**\nThe aggregates, truths, senses, and objects—form and emptiness—\nNone of these dharmas can be spoken.\nDeluded views are wholly extinguished,\nThe quiescent essence abides thus.\n\n**Verse on Sin and Merit**\nAll day walking, yet never walked.\nAll day sitting, yet never sat.\nCultivating goodness brings no merit,\nCommitting evil incurs no sin.\nIf one has not yet awakened to the mind,\nDo not cling to these words and act recklessly.\nAfter death, you must face King Yama—\nHow can you escape the cauldrons, pestles, and mills?\n\n**Verse on Perfect Penetration**\nSeeing true emptiness, emptiness is not empty;\nWhere is perfect clarity not all-pervading?\nSenses, objects, mind, and dharmas—all are without substance.\nOnly in wondrous function do we know their unity with things.\n\n**Verse on Following Conditions**\nThe myriad things lie before you,\nFollowing their movement or stillness, wielding their power.\nPerfect clarity, concentration, and wisdom remain unstained—\nLike water-born lotuses, dry of themselves.\n\n**Precious Moon Verse**\nA single bright moon hangs in the empty sky,\nIts pure light illumines all lands without obstruction.\nGather it, yet it does not accumulate; strike it, yet it does not disperse.\nAdvance, yet it does not proceed; retreat, yet it does not recede.\nThat is not distant, this is not near;\nOuter is not external, inner is not within.\nWithin sameness there is difference, within difference there is sameness—\nTell me, can the marionette understand this?\n\n**Song of the Pearl**\nThe poor man’s pearl in his robe,\nOriginally perfect and luminous.\nNot knowing to seek it himself,\nHe counts the treasures of others.\nCounting others’ treasures brings no benefit,\nOnly teaching you to waste effort in vain.\nBetter to recognize your own jewel—\nWorth countless millions in gold.\nThis precious pearl shines most brightly,\nIllumining the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.\nNever has it lacked even a fraction,\nYet it is obscured by floating clouds.\nSince recognizing this mani-pearl,\nWho still cherishes bubbles, illusions, or flowers?\nThe Buddha’s pearl and my pearl are one;\nMy nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.\nPearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—\nThe mind’s vastness effortlessly contains the Dharma-realm.\nLet the clamorous dust fill your eyes,\nPerfect concentration and wisdom remain ever at ease.\nNot emptiness, not form—\nWithin and without, radiantly unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,\nSelf-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?\nSeeing is completion; all affairs are finished.\nAbandoning learning, acting without effort, passing the days.\nStill as an unborn infant,\nMovement and rest follow conditions without fixation.\nNot cutting off delusion, not cultivating truth—\nThe mind of truth and delusion is but dust.\nFrom the beginning, all dharmas are without form;\nWithin formlessness, there is the Dharma-body.\nThe Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha—\nNeither human nor thing.\nVastly filling heaven and earth,\nIt is only subtlety, indistinctness, and vagueness.\nStains do not defile it; its light shines of itself.\nNo dharma does not arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—\nThus we know sin and merit are originally formless.\nNo Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—\nThe wise vision of a true person naturally differs.\nSpeaking, it roars like a lion,\nNot like the wild fox debating birth and extinction.\n\n**Song Pointing to Chan Delusion**\nThe Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water:\nWhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn movement and rest, it remains serene and clear—\nNot only when sitting is it thus.\nPeople today seek realization through silent sitting,\nNot knowing it lies entirely in seeing the nature.\nIf the nature is clear within seeing,\nSeeing itself settles within the nature.\nWhen concentration matures, wisdom’s function is boundless—\nThis is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.\nIf one seeks to fathom its essence and function,\nOne sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.\nWithin emptiness, not a single thing exists,\nNor subtlety, indistinctness, or vagueness.\nSeeking these elusive qualities,\nOne errs and loses the way.\nYet even these two words—erring and losing—\nCannot be grasped as evidence.\nThe original mind is itself empty space—\nHow could gain or loss ever touch it?\nSimply cast aside all dharmas,\nLeaving nothing remaining.\nSuddenly, perfect clarity manifests—\nThen you are no different from the Buddhas.\nThe physical body is my fetter;\nFor now, blend with the light and mingle with the world.\nIn all actions, be without mind—\nWhy contend over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?\nThis life is but a temporary abode;\nThe host of the inn is Vairocana.\nVairocana neither comes nor goes—\nThus we know birth and extinction are without residue.\nIf asked what Vairocana is like,\nIt is only that which has form that is not it.\nBefore your eyes, dusts and karmas abound—\nDusts and karmas are neither the same nor different.\nSeeing these dusts and karmas,\nEach is Śākyamuni, each is Kāśyapa.\nIf they differ, the myriad sounds all resound;\nIf they are the same, a single wind gathers all.\nTo recognize the mani-pearl,\nDo not say you must attain the Dharma to know it.\nWhen ill, use medicine to cure it;\nOnce healed, what need is there for medicine?\nWhen the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;\nWhen the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.\nLike a tarnished mirror polished—\nStains and grime naturally vanish.\nAll dharmas are fundamentally false,\nThus we are taught to leave all forms behind.\nWhen all forms are left behind, what remains?\nThis is called the supreme, true reality.\nIf you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,\nPractice equality, compassion, and relief of suffering.\nThough the bodhisattva’s original vow is profound,\nDo not grasp at existence within forms.\nThis is the perfect union of merit and wisdom—\nIn the future, you will receive prediction first.\nThe slightest dust of permanence or annihilation brings defilement—\nThen you have no affinity with the Buddhas.\nTurning the thoughts of deluded sentient beings,\nAll are stained by the habits of dust and desire.\nOnly because of excessive attachment to emotions\nDo they constantly take birth in wombs, eggs, transformation, or moisture.\nTo learn the Way, you must be fiercely resolute,\nYour heart of non-emotion hard as iron.\nEven if you have children, wives, and concubines,\nWhat difference is there between them and others?\nAlways guard a single sphere of light,\nSeeing no objects of desire to contemplate.\nAll dharmas are instantly unattached—\nWhat need is there to speak of hell or heaven?\nThen my life is in my own hands,\nIn emptiness, neither ascending nor descending.\nAppearing and disappearing in the Buddha-lands,\nNever leaving the original seat of bodhi.\nThe thirty-two transformations of Avalokiteśvara—\nI too shall realize them within.\nManifestations beyond conception\nAll arise from the nature of freedom.\nNot empty, not form—\nWithin and without, radiantly unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,\nSelf-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?\nSeeing is completion; all affairs are finished.\nAbandoning learning, acting without effort, passing the days.\nStill as an unborn infant,\nMovement and rest follow conditions without fixation.\nNot cutting off delusion, not cultivating truth—\nThe mind of truth and delusion is but dust.\nFrom the beginning, all dharmas are without form;\nWithin formlessness, there is the Dharma-body.\nThe Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha—\nNeither human nor thing.\nVastly filling heaven and earth,\nIt is only subtlety, indistinctness, and vagueness.\nStains do not defile it; its light shines of itself.\nNo dharma does not arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—\nThus we know sin and merit are originally formless.\nNo Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—\nThe wise vision of a true person naturally differs.\nSpeaking, it roars like a lion,\nNot like the wild fox debating birth and extinction.\n\nI am a Chan practitioner of no-mind,\nIn all matters, making no distinctions.\nOnce a black ox,\nToday wholly white.\nSometimes I sing and laugh alone,\nOthers say I lack sense.\nHow would they know that beneath this coarse robe,\nLies a priceless treasure?\n\nShould you see me speak of emptiness,\nIt would be like swallowing a date whole.\nThis Dharma only Buddhas can know—\nHow could the deluded grasp its surface?\n\nThere are also those who study Chan,\nMerely learning to spar with words and lips.\nThey boast of my quick replies,\nYet do not recognize the true host.\nThis is but gleaning branches and leaves,\nFailing to fathom the root.\nWith the root, branches and leaves flourish;\nWithout the root, they cannot endure.\n\nSome flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,\nYet remain entangled in self and other.\nCompared to my wondrous awakening at the source,\nThey are as distant as a thousand miles.\nSuch people are pitiable and laughable,\nHaving spent years studying the Dao in vain.\nToo proud to seek guidance,\nThey waste their lives in futility.\n\nThis stems from dull roots and heavy karmic delusion.\nIf they fail to awaken in this life,\nHow will they escape sinking in the next?\n\n*Reading the Song of Ancestral Courage from Chan Master Xuedou’s Collection*\n\nA single stream from Caoxi divides into a thousand branches,\nReflecting past and present without hindrance.\nYet recent scholars do not trace the source,\nMistaking a hoofprint’s puddle for the great ocean.\n\nMaster Xuedou grasped the true essence,\nStriking the Dharma drum with thunderous roars.\nThe lion king emerges from its den with a mighty roar,\nAll beasts and demons tremble in fear.\n\nSometimes in song, sometimes in verse,\nHe earnestly points the way for the lost.\nHis words are bold, his meaning profound,\nStriking jade and ringing gold through the ages.\n\nAlas, the deluded cling to appearances,\nChasing after words and counting names.\nThe true suchness of the Dharma is beyond speech,\nNeither low nor high, without bounds.\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor duality—\nThe ten directions’ dust and realms are one perfect circle.\n\nTrue samadhi makes no distinction between speech and silence,\nNeither grasped nor abandoned.\nSimply not clinging to any appearance—\nThis is the true conduct of the Tathagata.\n\nTo dispel delusion, one opposes it with truth,\nYet if delusion does not arise, truth also fades.\nOnly when both truth and delusion are seen as non-dual,\nDoes the true mind become unobstructed.\n\nUnobstructed, one attains freedom—\nA single awakening dissolves eons of transgressions.\nWithout effort, one realizes bodhi,\nHenceforth forever liberated from the sea of birth and death.\n\nMy teacher’s words flow freely of late,\nLeaving a model for the world.\nLast night, I summoned him,\nPierced his nostrils and hung him on a staff.\nWhen asked about the supreme truth,\nHe replied, “All speech is slander.”\n\n**On Precepts, Samadhi, and Wisdom**\n\nPrecepts, samadhi, and wisdom\nAre the wondrous functions within the Dharma.\nThough Buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them,\nThe unenlightened cling to their words.\n\nNow, briefly expounded to aid awakening:\nWhen mind and environment are both forgotten, and not a single thought arises—this is precepts.\nWhen awareness is perfectly luminous, inwardly and outwardly radiant—this is samadhi.\nWhen responding to conditions, with inexhaustible marvelous function—this is wisdom.\nThese three depend on one another, each both substance and function.\nThey are never apart, even for an instant.\n\nLike the sun relying on light to illuminate,\nAnd light relying on illumination to shine—\nWithout light, there is no illumination;\nWithout illumination, there is no shining.\nAt their root, precepts, samadhi, and wisdom are one nature;\nLight, illumination, and shining are one sun.\nIf even the one is not truly one,\nHow can the three be three?\nWhen both three and one are forgotten,\nThere is only profound clarity and purity.\n\n**Twelve Lyrics to the Tune of \"Moon over the West River\"**\n\nIllusions need not be forcibly extinguished,\nNor truth sought with desperate longing.\nThe original source and self-nature—Buddha’s cultivation is one;\nDelusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.\n\nAwakening—Buddha is realized in an instant;\nDelusion—one drifts for ten thousand kalpas.\nIf but a single thought aligns with true cultivation,\nAll sins as countless as the Ganges’ sands are wiped away.\n\nIt is inherently neither birth nor extinction,\nYet one clings to distinctions of arising and ceasing.\nEven sin and merit have no root—\nHow could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?\n\nI possess a luminous mirror,\nLong obscured by dust and dimness.\nToday, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth—\nTen thousand images stand revealed, none can hide.\n\nMy nature enters the nature of all Buddhas,\nAnd the nature of Buddhas everywhere is thus.\nLike the cold moon’s reflection in a cold spring,\nOne moon appears in a thousand pools.\n\nSmall as an invisible hair’s tip,\nVast as the filling of the three thousand worlds.\nHigh or low, it naturally conforms to square or round—\nWhy speak of long or short, deep or shallow?\n\nDharma after dharma—originally no dharma;\nEmptiness after emptiness—yet not emptiness.\nStillness and clamor, speech and silence—all are fundamentally the same;\nWhy labor to explain dreams within dreams?\n\nIn use, there is no use;\nIn effortless effort, effort is applied.\nLike a fruit ripening naturally red—\nAsk not how it was cultivated or sown.\n\nGood and evil forgotten in an instant,\nGlory and decay no longer concern the heart.\nDarkness and light, concealment and display—let them drift as they will;\nEat when hungry, drink when thirsty, as one’s portion allows.\n\nThe spirit serene, profoundly still—\nYet one may sit, lie, sing, or chant without hindrance.\nA pool of autumn water, deep and clear as jade—\nThough wind stirs, be not startled; let it be.\n\nFacing circumstances, no need to forcibly extinguish;\nProvisional names are but skillful means for bodhi.\nForm and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal;\nTruth and illusion need not be divided into two.\n\nAwakening is the Pure Land at once—\nNo need for distant India or Cao Creek.\nWho says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the western heavens?\nWhen realized, Amitābha manifests in the world.\n\nSelf and others, sentient beings and lifespan—\nWhy distinguish high or low, near or far?\nThe Dharma illumines all without exception;\nThought after thought, no need to seek.\n\nSeeing—what has ever truly seen?\nHearing—what was never heard?\nAll functions arise without mutual knowledge—\nWho can obstruct you in life or death?\n\nClinging to forms while practicing generosity,\nIts karmic reward remains within the realms of gods and humans.\nLike shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds—\nIt falls only when its force is spent.\n\nHow much better to embody the true mark of non-action,\nReturning to the source, reverting to simplicity and purity.\nForgetting circumstances, exhausting passions—let nature take its course,\nTo realize the forbearance of the unborn Dharma.\n\nWhen fish and rabbit are in hand,\nThe trap and snare are naturally forgotten.\nThe raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—\nOnce arrived, all are cast aside.\n\nBefore awakening, one relies on words;\nUpon awakening, words become false.\nThough these four lines speak of non-action,\nEven these must be transcended.\n\nAwakened, seek not quiescent extinction—\nFollow conditions and guide the deluded.\nCutting off eternalism and annihilationism, offering guidance—\nSkillful means point to the ultimate reality.\n\nThe five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,\nSix perfections, myriad practices—all cultivated in harmony.\nA single perfect radiance, a flawless mani jewel,\nBenefiting others while sustaining oneself.\n\nI see people today speak of nature,\nBoasting with glib tongues, quick to respond.\nYet when confronted with circumstances, they grow confused—\nHow are they different from the foolish?\n\nWhat is spoken must be practiced;\nOnly then is speech and action without flaw.\nWielding the sword of wisdom to sever the mani—\nThis is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.\n\nTo realize the wondrous Dao of the unborn,\nNothing but seeing one’s true mind.\nThe true body is without form or sound—\nOnly the pure Dharma-body remains thus.\n\nThis Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,\nNor is it to be sought in the middle.\nAbandoning both extremes and the center—\nSeeing this is called the supreme grade.\n\n**Postscript**\n\nI observe that human life arises from deluded emotions, giving rise to this body.\nWith this body comes suffering;\nIf there were no body, whence would suffering arise?\n\nTo escape suffering,\nNothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao.\nTo embody the supreme Dao,\nNothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.\n\nThus, the mind is the essence of the Dao,\nAnd the Dao is the function of the mind.\nIf one can examine the mind and observe nature,\nThe luminous essence manifests naturally,\nAnd the effortless function arises spontaneously.\nWithout applying contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore.\n\nIf not for the mind-mirror shining brightly,\nThe divine pearl resplendent and clear,\nHow could all appearances instantly dissolve,\nNot a speck of dust adhere,\nThe mind’s source be free,\nAnd the certainty of the unborn be attained?\n\nThose who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao\nAre not burdened by the body,\nNor disturbed by circumstances.\nHow could blades or weapons harm them?\nHow could tigers or rhinoceroses endanger them?\nHow could great fires or floods cause concern?\n\nThe awakened one’s mind, like a mirror reflecting circumstances,\nDiscerns without grasping.\nResponding to conditions, harmonizing without leading—\nThus, they overcome phenomena without injury.\nThis is the wondrous Dao of the supreme, utmost truth.\n\nOriginally, the Dao has no name—\nThe sage forcibly named it.\nOriginally, the Dao has no words—\nThe sage forcibly spoke of it.\n\nYet if names and words were silenced,\nLater generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to truth.\nThus, the sage established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao.\nThe Dao is revealed through words,\nAnd words are forgotten in the Dao.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle,\nYet the world’s people, dull in root-nature,\nCling to their bodies, loathe death, and delight in life—\nThus, they ultimately struggle to awaken.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments,\nUsed the art of cultivating life,\nFollowing their desires to gradually guide them.\nThe essence of cultivating life lies in the golden elixir,\nAnd the essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flower pool.\nThus, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world,\nFor people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound.\nThough scholars recite their texts,\nNone grasp their meaning.\nWithout encountering a true master to transmit the oral instructions,\nEven with a hundred conjectures,\nOne can never apply the work or accomplish the task.\nIs this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs,\nWhile those who attain are as rare as qilin horns?\n\nIn the *jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu,\nWho transmitted the elixir method to me.\nSince then, three transmissions to unworthy recipients,\nThree encounters with calamities—\nEach lasting no more than twenty days.\nRecently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition:\n“One day, if someone comes to loosen your bonds and remove your shackles,\nYou must transmit it to them.\nAll others are not permitted.”\n\n\"Afterward, desiring to absolve myself from the ledger of names, yet fearing that later generations would not trust this Dao, I composed the *Wuzhen Pian*, setting forth the origins and completion of the elixir method. Once it was published, seekers flocked in throngs. Seeing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse, and so I selected from among them to transmit the teachings. Yet those to whom I transmitted were none of great influence or mighty power, none capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning, none magnanimous and exceptional, none benevolent and enlightened in the Dao.\n\nAt first, I suffered calamities once, then twice, yet my heart remained unenlightened. Only upon the third did I awaken to my past errors. Thus I know the Great Elixir’s method is most simple and most easy—even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to the realm of sages. This is why Heaven guards it in secrecy, forbidding its careless transmission to the unworthy.\n\nYet I, Boduan, disobeyed my teacher’s words, repeatedly leaking Heaven’s mysteries. Because I possess a body, I have each time borne Heaven’s reproof and suffering. So profound and swift is Heaven’s admonition—how dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself? From this day forward, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue. Though cauldrons and boiling oil stand before me, though blades press upon my neck, never again shall I dare speak of it.\"\n\nWithin this *Waking to Reality* are sung the subtle principles of the Great Elixir, its medicinal substances, and the firing times—all set forth in exhaustive detail. Should some devoted seeker, long possessing the bone of immortality, peruse these verses, their wisdom and discernment will naturally awaken, enabling them to trace the text and fathom its meaning. What need have they for this Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In such a case, the transmission is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous imparting.\n\nAs for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse upon seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrously awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its first priority; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately attach to it. Alas, common folk differ in the depth of their karmic conditions and the sharpness of their innate faculties. Even should they hear a single note, they will scatter into divergent views. Thus the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are nothing but the One Vehicle, yet as listeners comprehend according to their capacity, they naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nHereafter, should any person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. For such a one, a single word may awaken them to the ten thousand dharmas. If, however, residual habitual tendencies remain, they will revert to middling or inferior views—yet this is no fault of Boduan’s.\n\nWritten on the day *wuyin* in mid-summer of the year *wuwu*, the first of the Yuanfeng era, by Zhang Boduan Pingshu.

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *Awakening to Reality***\n\nAlas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away with ease. Who can fathom the span of life or escape the retribution of karma? If one does not awaken in time, content merely to await the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads will plunge one into the three evil destinies, where eons may pass without hope of deliverance. When that time comes, though one may repent, what use will it be?\n\nThus, the sages of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means in the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate the seed of transcendence and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect comprehension, one may directly cross to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to conditioned existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one may ascend to sagehood in an instant. But if one fails to awaken to the original nature, one remains mired in the illusory form.\n\nNext, the *Book of Changes* contains sayings on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny, while the *Analects* speaks of \"having no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no ego\"—these are Confucius’ profoundest insights into the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words so often brief and lacking in detail? It is because he sought to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—all active endeavors. Thus, he never explicitly expounded the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of destiny within the images of the *Changes* and mingled the methods of nature within his subtle words.\n\nAs for *Zhuangzi*, who exhaustively explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi* of integrity—both came close to the crux of the matter. Later, during the Han, Wei Boyang drew upon the *Changes* to elucidate the principle of yin-yang union in the *Can Tong Qi*, clarifying the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of the Loyal Lineage, in the preface to his recorded sayings, expounded the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the root and branches of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?\n\nYet how lamentable that later generations of Daoist and Buddhist practitioners, each clinging to their own sect, have disparaged one another, causing the essential purport of the three traditions to be lost amid heterodox paths, unable to merge and return to unity!\n\nMoreover, people today assume that the Daoist path emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two: those that are easily encountered but difficult to perfect, and those that are difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the Five Sprouts, absorbing the radiance of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and chanting talismans, clicking the teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating the spirit and holding the breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, or practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining minerals, herbs, and other substances—all belong to the category of what is easily encountered but difficult to perfect.\n\nThe above methods, in their approach to cultivating the body, are generally fragmented and incomplete. Though one may expend great effort, no verifiable results are obtained. If one diligently applies oneself with bitter resolve, practicing day and night, one may at best avoid illness and prevent untimely misfortune. Yet if one ceases practice even for a day, previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such methods merely prolong the years without hope of true accomplishment. How can one expect to attain permanence, reverse aging, transform the body, and ascend in flight? It is truly pitiable!\n\nMost practitioners in recent times cling to delusions and fail to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, instead blaming the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages concealed the truth beneath a veil of symbolic names. Among these methods, only breath-holding resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles: if one can forget scheming and still the mind, one may enter samadhi and project the spirit. Yet the spirit belongs to yin, and the dwelling of the body is hard to stabilize, necessitating constant migration. Without mastering the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones, transform the yang, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?\n\nThe refinement of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir, by contrast, is difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the Jade Crucible simmers, and the Golden Furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this may be accomplished in a brief moment, yet it secures boundless ease and joy for eternity.\n\nAs for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing the upright and maintaining fullness, the key lies in embracing the feminine and holding to the One. Naturally, the *qi* of yang rebirth arises, and the form of yin dissolution is shed. Once the nodal phases are complete, one casts off the womb and transforms the spirit, the name is inscribed in the immortal register, and the title of Perfected One is conferred—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.\n\nYet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, designate the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidneys into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, employ spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and grasp fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they fathom the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang interpenetrating?\n\nAll this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returned Elixir? It is truly difficult!\n\nFrom youth, I have been fond of the Dao and traversed the scriptures of the Three Teachings, extending even to legal codes, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and misfortune, life and death—nothing has escaped my careful study. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, silver and lead, *li* and *kan* as male and female, capable of forming the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir. None, however, reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor do they explain the methods of fire phases, the measures of refinement, or the aims of nurturing and preservation.\n\nMoreover, later generations of deluded practitioners, indulging their fanciful interpretations, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancients, introducing myriad errors and distortions.",

      "translated_text": "Not only have they thrown the immortal classics into chaos, but they have also led later students astray. As for myself, having never encountered a perfected one nor received oral instructions, I grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withering away. Though I sought answers across mountains and seas, consulting both the wise and the foolish, none could truly comprehend the essential teaching or illuminate the depths of my heart.\n\nLater, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* reign (1069), while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my unwavering resolve and deep sincerity moved a true immortal to bestow upon me the secret instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and fire phases. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—pointing to the stream to reveal the source, speaking one to awaken a hundred. Like mist dispersing to reveal the sun’s brilliance, or dust settling to expose a mirror’s clarity, they aligned with the immortal classics as if matching tally tokens.\n\nI observed that of those who pursue immortality, eight or nine in ten do so; yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essence. Having received this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it? I poured forth all I had gained, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them are sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, reflecting the number of the two eights; sixty-four jueju, arranged according to the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*; one five-character verse, symbolizing the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully expounded the hierarchy of the crucible, the weights of the ingredients, the progression and retreat of the fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the interplay of existence and non-existence, and the auspices of fortune and misfortune.\n\nYet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and securing the body, leaving the original awakening of the true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs had attained enlightenment through a bamboo’s strike. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I appended to the end of the scroll. Here, at last, the Way of realizing the fundamental and illuminating the nature is made complete.\n\nMay those of shared aspiration who read this perceive the root through the branches and abandon delusion to follow the real.\n\n**Scroll One: Sixteen Seven-Character Quatrains**",

      "translated_text": "**(Marking the count of two eights and one jin)**\n\n**I**\nNot seeking the great Dao to escape delusion’s way,\nThough burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of life—spark struck from stone,\nA lifetime’s fate—bubble afloat on water.\nOnly craving fame and profit, chasing glory’s sheen,\nUnheeding how the form withers, darkly sere and dry.\nAsk then: though gold be piled like mountains high,\nCan impermanence be bought to grant a single \"no\"?\n\n**II**\nThough man’s life may span a hundred years,\nShort or long, poverty or ease—none can foreknow.\nYesterday through streets he galloped proud,\nToday in coffin lies his sleeping shroud.\nWife and wealth abandoned, no longer his to hold,\nKarmic deeds advance—no self-deceit can hide.\nIf the great elixir is not sought, how chance to meet?\nMeeting yet not refining—foolish folly indeed.\n\n**III**\nTo learn immortality, learn the Heavenly Immortal’s way,\nFor only the Golden Vessel is most true and sure.\nWhen the two meet, nature and feeling unite,\nWhere the Five Phases are whole, tiger and dragon coil.\nOriginally through *xu* and *ji* they wed as matchmakers,\nThus husband and wife in joyous union stay.\nAwaiting only merit’s completion to ascend the Jade Towers,\nAmid ninefold rosy clouds, riding the auspicious radiance.\n\n**IV**\nThree, five, one—three characters in all,\nFrom ancient times to now, few truly understand.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five,\nNorth’s one and west’s four share the same.\n*Xu* and *ji* dwell in the generative number five,\nWhen the three families meet, the infant is conceived.\nThe infant is the One, containing true qi,\nTen months’ gestation complete—entering the sage’s foundation.\n\n**V**\nGrasses and trees, yin and yang—both must align,\nIf one is lacking, no fragrance will rise.\nFirst unfurl green leaves, yang taking the lead,\nThen bloom red blossoms, yin following after.\nThe common way is but this in daily use,\nYet who knows the true source’s reversal and return?\nI say to all who study the Dao:\nWithout knowing yin and yang, do not act in vain.\n\n**VI**\nWithin yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness,\nCultivating one alone leaves the body frail.\nExhausting form with exercises—none is the Dao,\nIngesting qi, dining on mist—all is madness.\nThe world vainly seeks lead and mercury’s taming,\nWhen will they witness tiger and dragon’s descent?\nI urge you: exhaustively seek your birth’s origin,\nReturning to the root, restoring the source—this is the Medicine King.\n\n**VII**\nEvery person possesses the elixir of long life,\nYet deluded fools cast it aside in vain.\nWhen sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite,\nWhere yellow sprouts arise, *kan* and *li* intertwine.\nThe well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists,\nThe hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.\nWhen the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house of itself—\nWhy seek herbs to burn and thatch?\n\n**VIII**\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits,\nSeeking myriad herbs is not the true way.\nYin and yang, matched in kind, return to mutual resonance,\nTwo eights in balance naturally unite as kin.\nAt the pool’s bottom, the sun’s red dispels yin’s specters,\nOn the mountain’s peak, the moon’s white brings fresh elixir sprouts.\nIf men would know true lead and mercury,\nThey are not mere cinnabar or quicksilver.\n\n**IX**\nThis method is true, yet within it truer still,\nFor it arises from my singular difference from others.\nI know the inversion comes from *li* and *kan*,\nBut who discerns the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,\nThe jade pool first receives silver from water.\nThe divine work of firing is not a day’s labor—\nBehold: in the deep pool, a single moon’s wheel appears.\n\n**X**\nTo know where the medicine’s river-source arises,\nThe moon in the southwest is its native land.\nWhen lead meets *gui*’s birth, swiftly gather it,\nGold at full moon’s distance is not fit to taste.\nSend it to the earthen crucible, seal fast,\nThen into flowing pearls let them pair and unite.\nThe medicine weighs two jin—two eights required,\nHarmonizing fire and timing, entrusting to yin and yang.\n\n**XI**\nTiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,\nAt the center’s rightful place, the mysterious pearl is born.\nFruit on the branch awaits ripening in time,\nThe child in the womb—how could it be different?\nNorth and south schools reverse the hexagrams’ signs,\nDawn and dusk’s firing accords with the celestial pivot.\nKnow that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace—\nWhy must one guard solitude in deep mountains?\n\n**XII**\nNot knowing the inversion within the mysterious,\nHow can one plant lotuses in fire?\nLead the White Tiger home to rear,\nBear a bright pearl round as the moon.\nVainly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing,\nSimply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting to nature.\nWhen the host of yin is wholly stripped away, the cinnabar ripens,\nLeaping from the cage to live ten thousand years.\n\n**XIII**\nYellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find,\nBut the adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.\nThe Four Images and Five Phases wholly depend on earth,\nThe Three Primes and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave *ren*?\nRefining into the numinous treasure is hard to recognize,\nDissolving yin’s demons, ghosts dare not invade.\nWishing to leave secret formulas among men,\nYet not one encounter proves a knowing friend.\n\n**XIV**\nDiligently seek true lead with intent,\nLest time slip by too easily.\nSimply capture earth’s *po* to tame cinnabar’s mercury,\nNaturally heaven’s *hun* will subdue water’s gold.\nThis may be called Dao so lofty dragons and tigers submit,\nWorthy of saying virtue so weighty ghosts and spirits revere.\nAlready knowing life spans equal heaven and earth,\nNo cause for affliction to rise in the heart.\n\n**XV**\nNot recognizing true lead as the primal ancestor,\nAll efforts applied are but wasted toil.\nRenouncing wives vainly severs yin and yang,\nFasting empties the bowels—all in vain.\nGrasses and trees, yin and yang—all are dregs,\nClouds and mist, sun and moon—belong to the turbid.\nEven adding breathing exercises and visualization,\nAll differ from the work of the golden elixir.\n\n**XVI**\nTen thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures speak the same,\nThe Golden Vessel alone is the root and source.\nRelying on *kun*’s position to form the body,\nPlanted in *qian*’s house, the organs of resonance.\nMarvel not that the celestial mechanism is wholly revealed,\nOnly because scholars are all benighted and dull.\nIf one can grasp the meaning within these verses,\nAt once they will meet the Three Purities’ Most High Lord.\n\n**Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains**",

This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I appended to the end of the scroll.

      "translated_text": "**(By Hexagram and Number)**\n\n**I**\nThe Dao from emptiness gives birth to the primal qi,\nFrom this single qi arise yin and yang.\nYin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,\nThe Three Bodies engender the flourishing of the ten thousand things.\n\n**II**\nThe ten thousand things, teeming, each return to the root;\nReturning to the root and reviving life is everlasting.\nTo know constancy and return to the origin—few comprehend,\nWhile reckless action invites misfortune, as all have heard.\n\n**III**\nSimply take the gate of death as the gate of life,\nDo not cling to the gate of life and call it the gate of death.\nIf one grasps the mechanism of killing and reversal,\nOnly then will one know that harm conceals grace.\n\n**IV**\nFortune and misfortune from of old intertwine,\nLike echo and shadow following one another.\nIf one can turn this mechanism of life and death,\nDisaster transforms to blessing in the space between palm and hand.\n\n**V**\nTo secure the Valley Spirit and never die,\nOne must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\nOnce true essence returns to the golden chamber,\nA single luminous pearl will never depart.\n\n**VI**\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world,\nDo not mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose.\nEven with a thousand years of breathing exercises,\nHow can one seize the golden horse and grapple the hare?\n\n**VII**\nFew know that different names arise from the same source,\nThese two mysteries within mysteries are the essential mechanism.\nTo preserve life and perfect form, discern gain and loss—\nThe purple-gold elixir is most wondrous and rare.\n\n**VIII**\nNot recognizing yin and yang, nor host and guest,\nHow can one know which is distant and which is near?\nIn the chamber, vainly sealing the Gate of Tailbone,\nHow many in Jambudvīpa have been led to ruin?\n\n**IX**\nFirst observe heaven to understand the Five Thieves,\nNext examine earth to pacify the people.\nOnly when the people are at peace and the state prosperous should one wage war,\nAfter war’s end can the sage be seen.\n\n**X**\nIn deployment, distinguish left and right armies,\nThough they may be host and I the guest.\nI urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,\nLest you lose our priceless treasure.\n\n**XI**\nThe Three Powers plunder one another in their time,\nThis is the mechanism of the immortals’ virtue and power.\nOnce the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,\nThe hundred bones are all ordered, and non-action is realized.\n\n**XII**\nThe *Yinfu*’s treasured words exceed three hundred,\nThe *Daode*’s numinous script fills five thousand.\nImmortals of past and present are without number,\nYet all from this point reach the true essence.\n\n**XIII**\nThe *Cantong Qi*, scriptures, and songs expound the utmost truth,\nYet fire-phases are not set down in writing.\nTo know the oral instructions that penetrate the mystery,\nOne must discuss them carefully with an immortal.\n\n**XIV**\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a teacher’s transmission, do not force guesses.\nFor elixir scriptures lack oral instructions,\nWhere then can you congeal the numinous embryo?\n\n**XV**\nDreaming of thirst, I ascended Xihua to the nine heavens,\nWhere a perfected one bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan* chapter.\nIts essentials are few, with little speech,\nOnly teaching one to refine mercury and lead.\n\n**XVI**\nDo not use common lead—use true lead,\nYet even true lead, once used, must be discarded.\nThis is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:\nTo use lead is not to use it—this is the truth.\n\n**XVII**\nWhen bamboo is split, it must be mended with bamboo;\nTo hatch a chicken, one must use an egg.\nAll other methods are vain toil,\nHow can they compare to true lead, which contains the sacred mechanism?\n\n**XVIII**\nDo not hide in the mountains before refining the returning elixir,\nFor all before and after in the mountains is not lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nYet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.\n\n**XIX**\n\"Empty the heart and fill the belly\"—both meanings run deep,\nBut to empty the heart, one must first know the heart.\nBetter to refine lead and first fill the belly,\nThen guard the hall filled with gold.\n\n**XX**\nThe sun dwelling in *Li*’s position becomes female,\nThe moon paired with the Toad Palace is male.\nIf one does not grasp this inversion,\nDo not presume to speak of lofty matters with limited insight.\n\n**XXI**\nThe *Zhen* dragon’s mercury emerges from *Li*’s land,\nThe *Dui* tiger’s gold is born in *Kan*’s direction.\nThese two things arise as the child produces the mother,\nThe Five Phases must all enter the center.\n\n**XXII**\nIf *Li* and *Kan* lack *Xu* and *Ji*,\nThough they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.\nOnly because each holds true earth,\nCan the golden elixir return and revert.\n\n**XXIII**\nFire born of wood inherently conceals its edge,\nWithout understanding, do not forcefully drill.\nDisaster arises from this—it harms oneself,\nOne must subdue it to seek the Metal Lord.\n\n**XXIV**\nThe Metal Lord is originally the Eastern House’s son,\nSent to dwell in the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.\nIf you recognize and summon him to return and nurture,\nPair him with the Maiden to forge a bond.\n\n**XXV**\nThe Maiden wanders in all directions,\nHer forward path must be short, her rearward long.\nReturning, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nTo wed the Metal Lord as her old husband.\n\n**XXVI**\nTake the solid center from *Kan*’s position,\nTo transmute the yin within *Li*’s palace.\nFrom this, it transforms into *Qian*’s vigorous body,\nHidden or soaring—all is governed by the heart.\n\n**XXVII**\nFirst take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible and vessel,\nNext gather the hare and crow to cook the medicine.\nOnce these two are driven into the Yellow Path,\nHow can the golden vessel fail to be born?\n\n**XXVIII**\nEstablish the furnace and set up the vessel according to *Qian* and *Kun*,\nRefine the essence to subdue the po and hun.\nGathering and dispersing, misty and dense, they transform,\nDare one treat such mysteries as trivial?\n\n**XXIX**\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,\nOnly with medicine can creation and transformation arise.\nIf the crucible lacks a true seed,\nIt is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.\n\n**XXX**\nEven if you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the fire-phases, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends entirely on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth of delay, and the elixir will not form.\n\n**XXXI**\nBlack containing white is the elixir’s mother,\nYang concealing yin is the sacred embryo.\nThe Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care,\nThe Three Fields gather treasures like the Three Terraces.\n\n**XXXII**\nWithin the indistinct, seek the image,\nWithin the profound darkness, find the true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being mutually enter,\nWithout seeing, how can one imagine it complete?\n\n**XXXIII**\nThe eldest son suddenly drinks wine from the west,\nThe youngest daughter first blooms flowers in the north.\nOnce the Green Maiden meets him,\nAll is sealed at once in the Yellow House.\n\n**XXXIV**\nOn Mount Hua’s peak, the male tiger roars,\nIn Fusang’s sea, the female dragon sings.\nThe Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,\nSending them to become husband and wife with one heart.\n\n**XXXV**\nThe White Tiger of the Western Mountain rages,\nThe Green Dragon of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,\nTransforming into a sheet of purple-gold frost.\n\n**XXXVI**\nThe Red Dragon and Black Tiger, each in west and east,\nThe Four Images intersect in *Xu* and *Ji*.",

kindling or forced breath?\n\n**XLIII**\nBetween the waning and waxing moon’s phases,\nThe medicine’s flavor is balanced, its qi complete.\nOnce gathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,\nForged and nurtured as if simmering fresh delicacies.\n\n**XLIV**\nIn the hare and rooster’s months, at their appointed time,\nPunishment and virtue arrive at the gate—such is the medicine’s

and adding, tending the fire, guard against peril.\n\n**XLIX**\nSun and moon meet once every thirty days,\nExchanging time for days by the method of divine work.\nDefending the city or waging wild battles, knowing fortune and misfortune,\nOne gains numinous cinnabar filling the tripod with red.\n\n**L**\nThe mysterious pearl takes form as yang arises,\nYang at its peak, yin wanes, gradually stripping away form.\nIn the tenth month, frost flies, the elixir ripens,\nAt this time, even spirits and ghosts must be startled.\n\n**LI**\nAfter drinking at Jasper Pool, the moon’s radiance clears,\nMounting a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the assembled immortals,\nThe seas and fields, hills and valleys may shift at will.\n\n**LII**\nDo not exert

forms.\n\n**LVI**\nBefore refining the returned elixir, refine it swiftly;\nOnce refined, one must know when to stop and be content.\nIf one’s heart remains insatiable in holding abundance,\nOne will inevitably one day suffer distress and humiliation.\n\n**LVII**\nOnly after adversity and prosperity pass through myriad things’ fullness,\nDo difficulty and simplicity receive their seals, upholding generation.\nIn this, attaining the meaning, one must forget images;\nIf one exhaustively investigates the hexagrams, one vainly labors the emotions.\n\n**LVIII**\nThe hexagrams’ established methods are originally forms,\nAttaining the image, forgetting words, the intent becomes clear.\nThe deluded people of the world cling only to images,\nYet practice hexagram qi, hoping for ascension.\n\n**LIX**\nHeaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness have their times;\nOnly by discerning ebb and flow does one grasp the mechanism.\nFrom of old, *geng* and *jia* clarify the mandate,\nSlaying the Three Worms, the Dao may be attained.\n\n**LX**\nWhen the Four Images converge, the mysterious body is complete,\nWhere the Five Phases are whole, purple light shines.\nShedding the embryo, entering the mouth, one becomes divine and sagely,\nCountless divine dragons all lose their astonishment.\n\n**LXI**\nMedicine meets its kindred qi to form an image,\nThe Dao resides in emptiness, uniting with spontaneity.\nSwallowing a single grain of numinous elixir,\nOne then knows my life is not ruled by heaven.\n\n**LXII**\nThe great Dao’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,\nOne knows it depends on me, yet also on heaven.\nIf not for accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue,\nAt every move, hordes of demons would obstruct the path.\n\n**LXIII**\nOnly when the mind-monkey is stilled and the square-inch mechanism,\nThree thousand merits and deeds align with heaven.\nNaturally there is a tripod to refine dragon and tiger,\nWhy cling to home, yearning for children and wife?\n\n**LXIV**\nCultivation blends with the world, yet harmonizes its light,\nRound when round, square when square.\nConcealed or revealed, contrary or compliant, none can

      "translated_text": "**(On the Intercalary Month as Symbol)**\nThe elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body,\nRefined, it transforms endlessly.\nFurther, on the nature, one investigates the true source,\nMastering the wondrous function of non-arising.\nNo need to await another life or future rebirth—\nIn this very moment, attain the Buddha’s divine powers.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this merit,\nWho since has been able to follow in her footsteps?\n\n**Five Quatrains**\n*(On the Five Phases as Symbol)*\n\n**I**\nThough you comprehend the true suchness of nature,\nYou still must cast off the body and abandon the human form.\nWhy not also refine the great medicine,\nInstantly transcending the leakless to become a true person?\n\n**II**\nRebirth, possession-stealing, and relocation—\nThe old dwelling is but the fool of cause and effect.\nIf you master the subduing of the dragon and taming of the tiger,\nWhen will the house of true gold ever wither?\n\n**III**\nMirroring form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—\nAt first, the path is arduous; later, it becomes smooth.\nThough in an instant you may roam ten thousand lands,\nAlas, if the house is broken, you must still move.\n\n**IV**\nThe Śākya’s teaching urges cultivation of the Land of Bliss,\nOnly because the Land of Bliss is the golden realm.\nFor the most part, among forms and appearances, only this is real;\nThe other two are not true—vainly do they measure.\n\n**V**\nCommon sayings often speak of uniting with the supreme Dao,\nOne should seek within it with care.\nIf you can invert the ordinary in daily use,\nAll the dust and sand of the great earth become treasures.\n\n**Appendix: Reading the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***\nThe wondrous function of the great elixir follows Qian and Kun,\nAs Qian and Kun move, the Five Phases divide.\nWhen the Five Phases flow forward, the common Dao has arising and ceasing;\nWhen the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring.\nFrom the first sign in the formless,\nThe Two Modes arise from the One Root.\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies,\nThe Eight Trigrams mutually beget as parent and child.\nThe ten thousand images arise from change and movement,\nFortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—here they divide.\nThe common people use it daily yet do not know,\nThe sage alone can fathom its origin.\nThus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,\nAnd so it entrusts its image to this text.\nWhen Pi and Tai alternate, yin and yang now rise, now fall;\nWhen Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness are in morning and dusk.\nKan and Li are the male and female, water and fire;\nZhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, po and hun.\nAbiding in the center, the yellow skirt is supremely auspicious;\nEncountering Kang, there is no position, no honor.\nHaving not yet carefully observed the end and beginning of the ten thousand things,\nOne again meets with Gou, revealing the return of the two qi.\nThe moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit;\nThe sun’s rising and setting accord with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.\nThe words were established to clarify the image,\nOnce the image is grasped, the words are forgotten.\nIt is like setting up an image to point to the meaning—\nWhen the true meaning is realized, the image is discarded.\nThose who understand value simplicity and ease;\nThose who are deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.\nThus, the adept who cultivates the true\nShould not, in reading the *Cantong Qi*, cling to images or grasp at words.\n\n**Song for Master Liu of White Dragon Cave**\nJade flows, gold flies—the two luminaries rush,\nNo sooner do flowers bloom than autumn frost arrives.\nVainly do they boast of Peng Zu’s thousand years—\nIt is but a lightning flash in the clouds.\nA lightning flash—how fleeting!\nA hundred years amount to thirty thousand days,\nDuring which cold and heat alternately torment,\nUnnoticed, the youthful face fades in darkness.\nEven with children and grandchildren before your eyes,\nAffection and love only deepen the entanglement.\nWhen vitality is exhausted and the body withers,\nWho can devise a way to briefly delay?\nBriefly delay—yet there is no method,\nInevitably, the body returns to flowing water.\nJust look at the sages and worthies of old—\nHow many have managed to remain in the world?\nTo remain in the world—there is a way,\nOnly because people of this age lack the capacity.\nThey race into the mountains to seek herbs and trees,\nTo subdue lead and refine mercury, to congeal cinnabar.\nTo congeal cinnabar—this matter is far removed,\nOne must seek the crimson blood within Kan.\nSeize it, bring it to Li’s position to restrain yin essence,\nBlend and harmonize—there is a proper season.\nWhen the season is right, employ the matchmaker:\nThe Metal Elder and the Alchemical Maiden wed.\nThe Metal Elder prefers to ride the white tiger,\nThe Alchemical Maiden always mounts the red dragon’s body.\nThe tiger comes to sit quietly in the autumn mountains,\nThe dragon stirs in the depths of the pool.\nThe two beasts meet and battle,\nWaves surge and boil like a cauldron.\nThe Yellow Dame and Ding the Elder lend their numinous power,\nShaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.\nIn an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,\nA mysterious pearl is planted in the mud.\nFrom this, the root and sprout gradually grow,\nNurtured in season, embracing true essence.\nAfter ten months, the fetus is shed—swallow it,\nUnnoticed, the mortal body already possesses numinosity.\nThis matter—rare in the world,\nNot known to ordinary people.\nIf in past lives you lacked the bone of immortality,\nHow could you easily encounter it?\nHaving encountered it—refine it at once,\nFor the light and shadow press on like an arrow.\nTo catch the fish, you must cast the net;\nDo not merely stand by the river and sigh in vain.\nI hear you have known the medicine for many years—\nWhy not gather your mind and refine mercury and lead?\nDo not let the candle be blown out by the wind,\nLest you blame heaven for the six paths of rebirth.\nLately, people in the world are full of deceit,\nAll donning Daoist robes and calling themselves adepts.\nAsk them what metal and wood are—\nThey fall silent, mute as if afflicted.\nYet they speak of refining qi and fasting,\nClaiming other schools and paths are long.\nHave you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?\nThe method of embracing the true within the Great One is most excellent.\nDo not fault my words for being wild and coarse—\nIt is only because people of this age are hard to discern.\nOnly when your heart is one with mine\nDare I pour out my thoughts to you.\n\n**Song of Stone Bridge**\nMy home lies north of Stone Bridge,\nWhere mountains guard and waters seal, ancient trees stand dense.\nBeneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,\nBelow the mountain, the spring’s drink is fragrant and rich.\nMy dwelling within the mountains is truly worthy of praise,\nEverywhere, I plant the unadorned flower.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave harbors a fierce tiger,\nEmerging from its den, it roars, stirring wind and mist.\nSouth of the mountain, the pool’s depths hide a flood dragon,\nRising in clouds, it descends rain, veiling the peaks in haze.\nThe two beasts meet and battle,\nThe primal pearl lies hidden—an auspicious sign.\nThe scene is enviable—I secretly rejoice,\nPouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nIts notes, one by one, teach with care.\nAlas, in drunkenness, none understand,\nMuddled and silent, as if foolish.\nGazing upward, I observe the marvelous workings of creation—\nThe sun still sets in the west, the moon still rises in the east.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,\nInversion and reversion of yin and yang accord with nature.\nDiscern where the Five Phases reverse and overturn,\nAnd you shall ascend in rosy clouds to the Grotto-Heaven.\n\nA golden chamber, jade rafters,\nJade maidens and golden lads attend before you day and night.\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,\nThe myriad phenomena manifest boundlessly.\n\nNo day nor night, only ceaseless continuity,\nGathering and dispersing, drawing and adding—fire and timing complete.\nShould you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,\nSeek a master to reveal the lead within the water.\n\nWood engenders fire, metal engenders water,\nWater and fire must distinguish fore and aft ranks.\nTo discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,\nLead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.\n\nThere is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,\nKnow contentment, ever content, return to the root.\nThe myriad spirits all celebrate the era of Great Peace,\nWhen the nation prospers and the people rejoice.\n\nThis matter is well worth pondering,\nThose of the same Dao know this truth.\nLater generations who study the cultivation of reality\nSpeak only of preserving and nurturing, of circulating qi.\nBefore your eyes, it seems so easy,\nYet those who attain it are wondrous beyond compare.\nFirst, it banishes illness and extends years,\nThen, through firing and refining, transforms the body into yang.\n\nLearners of the Dao, turn your thoughts inward,\nDo not inquire of side doors or minor methods.\nThey know only how to deceive others in the moment,\nUnaware that their own bodies wither in obscurity.\n\nI urge later students to be bold and resolute,\nDo not idly abandon home to dwell in distant lands.\nThe wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,\nHow could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?\n\nDo not procrastinate, do not indulge in baseness,\nHasten to seek a master and grasp the primordial intent.\nIf in this life you do not study and cultivate,\nWho knows what womb you may enter in the next?\n\nIf you have the heart, persevere to the end,\nFor the great matter of life is none other than birth and death.\nIf Heaven should betray one of Daoist heart,\nI would be consigned to the three evil paths as a lowly ghost.\n\n*Awakening to the True Nature School*\n*Four Quatrains*\n\nThe Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades the Ganges’ sands,\nThe myriad phenomena stand in serried ranks, unobstructed.\nWhen you comprehend the true Dharma-eye of perfect interpenetration,\nYou will know the three realms are your home.\n\nGazing, you cannot see its form,\nYet when you call, it responds.\nDo not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—\nIf there were no valley, what sound would there be?\n\nOne thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing,\nFor all dust-bound realms reveal its mechanism.\nYet even this wondrous one thing is not truly existent—\nOn what do the four depend?\n\nWithout moving a step, you reach the Western Heaven,\nFor all directions sit plainly before your eyes.\nThe light behind your neck is still illusion,\nClouds beneath your feet do not make you immortal.\n\n*Eulogy on the Nature-Ground*\n\nBuddha-nature is neither same nor different,\nA thousand lamps share one light.\nAdd to it—can you truly augment?\nSubtract from it—can you truly diminish?\nTaking and forsaking both pass without fault,\nBurning and drowning cause no harm.\nThe dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—\nNot one can be fathomed.\n\n*Eulogy on Arising and Ceasing*\n\nSeeking birth, it is originally unborn,\nFearing cessation, it has never briefly ceased.\nEyes see, yet do not compare to ears hearing,\nMouth speaks, yet how does it rival the nose’s telling?\n\n*Eulogy on the Three Realms as Mind Alone*\n\nThe three realms are the wondrous principle of mind alone,\nThe myriad things are neither this nor that.\nNot one thing is not my mind,\nNot one thing is my self.\n\n*Eulogy on Seeing the Mind in All Things*\n\nSee the thing, and you see the mind,\nWithout things, the mind does not appear.\nWithin the ten directions’ passage and obstruction,\nThe true mind is all-pervading.\nIf you give rise to intellectual understanding,\nYou fall into inverted views.\nWhen you behold phenomena without mind,\nOnly then do you see the bodhi face.\n\n*Eulogy on Equalizing Things*\n\nI am not different from others,\nYet others’ minds differ from mine.\nPeople have near and far,\nI have no this or that.\nBeasts of land and water, birds in flight—\nI regard them as one body.\nNoble and base, high and low,\nAre like hands and feet to me.\nI am not even I,\nHow could there be a you?\nWhen both this and that are gone,\nAll bubbles return to water.\n\n*Eulogy on the Mind Here and Now as Buddha*\n\nBuddha is mind, mind is Buddha,\nYet mind and Buddha have always been illusory things.\nIf you know there is no Buddha and no mind,\nOnly then is this the Dharmakāya Buddha.\n\nThe Dharmakāya Buddha has no form,\nA single orb of radiance contains the myriad phenomena.\nThe formless form is the true form,\nThe signless sign is the true sign.\nNeither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,\nNeither movement nor stillness, nor coming nor going.\nNo difference, no sameness, no being, no non-being,\nHard to grasp, hard to relinquish, hard to hear or hope for.\nWithin and without, round and bright, everywhere interpenetrating,\nOne Buddha-land lies within a single grain of sand.\nOne grain of sand contains the great thousandfold world,\nOne body and mind are ten thousand in unison.\nTo know this, you must master the mindless Dharma,\nUnstained and unobstructed—this is pure karma.\nGood and evil, a thousand kinds, yet nothing is done,\nThis is the true meaning of *namo* and Mahākāśyapa.\n\n*Eulogy on the Mindless*\n\nHow laughable, my mind—\nStubborn and coarse.\nStolid and drifting,\nIt entrusts things to their own course.\nIt does not understand cultivation,\nNor does it commit offenses.\nIt does not benefit others,\nNor does it seek for itself.\nIt does not uphold precepts,\nNor does it observe taboos.\nIt knows nothing of rites and music,\nNor does it practice benevolence and righteousness.\nOf all human abilities,\nIt has mastered not one.\nWhen hungry, it eats;\nWhen thirsty, it drinks.\nWhen tired, it sleeps;\nWhen awake, it walks.\nWhen hot, it wears light clothes;\nWhen cold, it covers itself.\nWithout thought, without worry,\nWhat sorrow? What joy?\nNo regret, no scheming,\nNo thought, no intent.\nAll worldly glory and shame\nAre but a travelers’ inn.\nBirds roosting in trees and woods\nMay be likened to this.\nComing, it does not forbid;\nGoing, it does not stop.\nIt neither avoids nor seeks,\nNeither praises nor blames.\nIt does not loathe the ugly,\nNor does it admire the beautiful.\nIt does not hasten to quiet chambers,\nNor does it shun bustling markets.\nIt does not speak of others’ faults,\nNor does it boast of its own rightness.\nIt does not favor the noble,\nNor does it slight the lowly.\nLoved ones and enemies,\nGreat and small, inner and outer—\nSorrow and joy, gain and loss,\nReverence and contempt, peril and ease—\nThe mind does not regard them as two,\nBut meets all with equanimity.\nIt does not strive for blessings first,\nNor does it initiate calamity.\nIt responds only when moved,\nAnd rises again when pressed.\nIt does not fear blades,\nHow could it fear tigers?\nIt follows things in their naming,\nWhy cling to labels?\nThe eye does not pursue forms,\nSounds do not enter the ear.\nAll that has appearance\nIs but delusion and falsehood.\nMale and female forms and voices\nAre not fixed entities.\nForms and appearances are mindless,\nUnstained and unobstructed.\nFree and at ease,\nNothing can burden it.",
      "overlap_context": " clouds, it descends rain, veiling the peaks in haze.\nThe two beasts meet and battle,\nThe primal pearl lies hidden—an auspicious sign.\nThe scene is enviable—I secretly rejoice,\nPouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.\nDrunk, I pluck a stringless zither,\nIts notes, one by one, teach with care.\nAlas, in drunkenness, none understand,\nMuddled and silent, as if foolish.\nGazing upward, I observe the marvelous workings of creation—\nThe sun still sets in the west, the moon still rises in the east.",

strike it, yet it does not disperse.\nAdvance, yet it does not proceed; retreat, yet it does not recede.\nThat is not distant, this is not near;\nOuter is not external, inner is not within.\nWithin sameness there is difference, within difference there is sameness—\nTell me, can the marionette understand this?\n\n**Song of the Pearl**\nThe poor man’s pearl in his robe,\nOriginally perfect and luminous.\nNot knowing to seek it himself,\nHe counts the treasures of others.\nCounting others’ treasures brings no benefit,\nOnly teaching you to waste effort in vain.\nBetter to recognize your own jewel—\nWorth countless millions in gold.\nThis precious pearl shines most brightly,\nIllumining the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.\nNever has it lacked even a fraction,\nYet it is obscured by floating clouds.\nSince recognizing this mani-pearl,\nWho still cherishes bubbles, illusions, or flowers?\nThe Buddha’s pearl and my pearl are one;\nMy nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.\nPearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—\nThe mind’s vastness effortlessly contains the Dharma-realm.\nLet the clamorous dust fill your eyes,\nPerfect concentration and wisdom remain ever at ease.\nNot emptiness, not form—\nWithin and without, radiantly unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,\nSelf-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?\nSeeing is completion; all affairs are finished.\nAbandoning learning, acting without effort, passing the days.\nStill as an unborn infant,\nMovement and rest follow conditions without fixation.\nNot cutting off delusion, not cultivating truth—\nThe mind of truth and delusion is but dust.\nFrom the beginning, all dharmas are without form;\nWithin formlessness, there is the Dharma-body.\nThe Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha—\nNeither human nor thing.\nVastly filling heaven and earth,\nIt is only subtlety, indistinctness, and vagueness.\nStains do not defile it; its light shines of itself.\nNo dharma does not arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—\nThus we know sin and merit are originally formless.\nNo Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—\nThe wise vision of a true person naturally differs.\nSpeaking, it roars like a lion,\nNot like the wild fox debating birth and extinction.\n\n**Song Pointing to Chan Delusion**\nThe Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water:\nWhen the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.\nIn movement and rest, it remains serene and clear—\nNot only when sitting is it thus.\nPeople today seek realization through silent sitting,\nNot knowing it lies entirely in seeing the nature.\nIf the nature is clear within seeing,\nSeeing itself settles within the nature.\nWhen concentration matures, wisdom’s function is boundless—\nThis is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.\nIf one seeks to fathom its essence and function,\nOne sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.\nWithin emptiness, not a single thing exists,\nNor subtlety, indistinctness, or vagueness.\nSeeking these elusive qualities,\nOne errs and loses the way.\nYet even these two words—erring and losing—\nCannot be grasped as evidence.\nThe original mind is itself empty space—\nHow could gain or loss ever touch it?\nSimply cast aside all dharmas,\nLeaving nothing remaining.\nSuddenly, perfect clarity manifests—\nThen you are no different from the Buddhas.\nThe physical body is my fetter;\nFor now, blend with the light and mingle with the world.\nIn all actions, be without mind—\nWhy contend over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?\nThis life is but a temporary abode;\nThe host of the inn is Vairocana.\nVairocana neither comes nor goes—\nThus we know birth and extinction are without residue.\nIf asked what Vairocana is like,\nIt is only that which has form that is not it.\nBefore your eyes, dusts and karmas abound—\nDusts and karmas are neither the same nor different.\nSeeing these dusts and karmas,\nEach is Śākyamuni, each is Kāśyapa.\nIf they differ, the myriad sounds all resound;\nIf they are the same, a single wind gathers all.\nTo recognize the mani-pearl,\nDo not say you must attain the Dharma to know it.\nWhen ill, use medicine to cure it;\nOnce healed, what need is there for medicine?\nWhen the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;\nWhen the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.\nLike a tarnished mirror polished—\nStains and grime naturally vanish.\nAll dharmas are fundamentally false,\nThus we are taught to leave all forms behind.\nWhen all forms are left behind, what remains?\nThis is called the supreme, true reality.\nIf you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,\nPractice equality, compassion, and relief of suffering.\nThough the bodhisattva’s original vow is profound,\nDo not grasp at existence within forms.\nThis is the perfect union of merit and wisdom—\nIn the future, you will receive prediction first.\nThe slightest dust of permanence or annihilation brings defilement—\nThen you have no affinity with the Buddhas.\nTurning the thoughts of deluded sentient beings,\nAll are stained by the habits of dust and desire.\nOnly because of excessive attachment to emotions\nDo they constantly take birth in wombs, eggs, transformation, or moisture.\nTo learn the Way, you must be fiercely resolute,\nYour heart of non-emotion hard as iron.\nEven if you have children, wives, and concubines,\nWhat difference is there between them and others?\nAlways guard a single sphere of light,\nSeeing no objects of desire to contemplate.\nAll dharmas are instantly unattached—\nWhat need is there to speak of hell or heaven?\nThen my life is in my own hands,\nIn emptiness, neither ascending nor descending.\nAppearing and disappearing in the Buddha-lands,\nNever leaving the original seat of bodhi.\nThe thirty-two transformations of Avalokiteśvara—\nI too shall realize them within.\nManifestations beyond conception\nAll arise from the nature of freedom.\nNot empty, not form—\nWithin and without, radiantly unobstructed.\nThe six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,\nSelf-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?\nSeeing is completion;

      "translated_text": "**Twelve Lyrics to the Tune of \"Moon over the West River\"**\n\nIllusions need not be forcibly extinguished,\nNor truth sought with desperate longing.\nThe original source and self-nature—Buddha’s cultivation is one;\nDelusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.\n\nAwakening—Buddha is realized in an instant;\nDelusion—one drifts for ten thousand kalpas.\nIf but a single thought aligns with true cultivation,\nAll sins as countless as the Ganges’ sands are wiped away.\n\nIt is inherently neither birth nor extinction,\nYet one clings to distinctions of arising and ceasing.\nEven sin and merit have no root—\nHow could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?\n\nI possess a luminous mirror,\nLong obscured by dust and dimness.\nToday, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth—\nTen thousand images stand revealed, none can hide.\n\nMy nature enters the nature of all Buddhas,\nAnd the nature of Buddhas everywhere is thus.\nLike the cold moon’s reflection in a cold spring,\nOne moon appears in a thousand pools.\n\nSmall as an invisible hair’s tip,\nVast as the filling of the three thousand worlds.\nHigh or low, it naturally conforms to square or round—\nWhy speak of long or short, deep or shallow?\n\nDharma after dharma—originally no dharma;\nEmptiness after emptiness—yet not emptiness.\nStillness and clamor, speech and silence—all are fundamentally the same;\nWhy labor to explain dreams within dreams?\n\nIn use, there is no use;\nIn effortless effort, effort is applied.\nLike a fruit ripening naturally red—\nAsk not how it was cultivated or sown.\n\nGood and evil forgotten in an instant,\nGlory and decay no longer concern the heart.\nDarkness and light, concealment and display—let them drift as they will;\nEat when hungry, drink when thirsty, as one’s portion allows.\n\nThe spirit serene, profoundly still—\nYet one may sit, lie, sing, or chant without hindrance.\nA pool of autumn water, deep and clear as jade—\nThough wind stirs, be not startled; let it be.\n\nFacing circumstances, no need to forcibly extinguish;\nProvisional names are but skillful means for bodhi.\nForm and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal;\nTruth and illusion need not be divided into two.\n\nAwakening is the Pure Land at once—\nNo need for distant India or Cao Creek.\nWho says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the western heavens?\nWhen realized, Amitābha manifests in the world.\n\nSelf and others, sentient beings and lifespan—\nWhy distinguish high or low, near or far?\nThe Dharma illumines all without exception;\nThought after thought, no need to seek.\n\nSeeing—what has ever truly seen?\nHearing—what was never heard?\nAll functions arise without mutual knowledge—\nWho can obstruct you in life or death?\n\nClinging to forms while practicing generosity,\nIts karmic reward remains within the realms of gods and humans.\nLike shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds—\nIt falls only when its force is spent.\n\nHow much better to embody the true mark of non-action,\nReturning to the source, reverting to simplicity and purity.\nForgetting circumstances, exhausting passions—let nature take its course,\nTo realize the forbearance of the unborn Dharma.\n\nWhen fish and rabbit are in hand,\nThe trap and snare are naturally forgotten.\nThe raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—\nOnce arrived, all are cast aside.\n\nBefore awakening, one relies on words;\nUpon awakening, words become false.\nThough these four lines speak of non-action,\nEven these must be transcended.\n\nAwakened, seek not quiescent extinction—\nFollow conditions and guide the deluded.\nCutting off eternalism and annihilationism, offering guidance—\nSkillful means point to the ultimate reality.\n\nThe five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,\nSix perfections, myriad practices—all cultivated in harmony.\nA single perfect radiance, a flawless mani jewel,\nBenefiting others while sustaining oneself.\n\nI see people today speak of nature,\nBoasting with glib tongues, quick to respond.\nYet when confronted with circumstances, they grow confused—\nHow are they different from the foolish?\n\nWhat is spoken must be practiced;\nOnly then is speech and action without flaw.\nWielding the sword of wisdom to sever the mani—\nThis is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.\n\nTo realize the wondrous Dao of the unborn,\nNothing but seeing one’s true mind.\nThe true body is without form or sound—\nOnly the pure Dharma-body remains thus.\n\nThis Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,\nNor is it to be sought in the middle.\nAbandoning both extremes and the center—\nSeeing this is called the supreme grade.\n\n**Postscript**\n\nI observe that human life arises from deluded emotions, giving rise to this body.\nWith this body comes suffering;\nIf there were no body, whence would suffering arise?\n\nTo escape suffering,\nNothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao.\nTo embody the supreme Dao,\nNothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.\n\nThus, the mind is the essence of the Dao,\nAnd the Dao is the function of the mind.\nIf one can examine the mind and observe nature,\nThe luminous essence manifests naturally,\nAnd the effortless function arises spontaneously.\nWithout applying contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore.\n\nIf not for the mind-mirror shining brightly,\nThe divine pearl resplendent and clear,\nHow could all appearances instantly dissolve,\nNot a speck of dust adhere,\nThe mind’s source be free,\nAnd the certainty of the unborn be attained?\n\nThose who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao\nAre not burdened by the body,\nNor disturbed by circumstances.\nHow could blades or weapons harm them?\nHow could tigers or rhinoceroses endanger them?\nHow could great fires or floods cause concern?\n\nThe awakened one’s mind, like a mirror reflecting circumstances,\nDiscerns without grasping.\nResponding to conditions, harmonizing without leading—\nThus, they overcome phenomena without injury.\nThis is the wondrous Dao of the supreme, utmost truth.\n\nOriginally, the Dao has no name—\nThe sage forcibly named it.\nOriginally, the Dao has no words—\nThe sage forcibly spoke of it.\n\nYet if names and words were silenced,\nLater generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to truth.\nThus, the sage established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao.\nThe Dao is revealed through words,\nAnd words are forgotten in the Dao.\n\nAlas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle,\nYet the world’s people, dull in root-nature,\nCling to their bodies, loathe death, and delight in life—\nThus, they ultimately struggle to awaken.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments,\nUsed the art of cultivating life,\nFollowing their desires to gradually guide them.\nThe essence of cultivating life lies in the golden elixir,\nAnd the essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flower pool.\nThus, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world,\nFor people delight in life.\n\nYet their words are veiled and their principles profound.\nThough scholars recite their texts,\nNone grasp their meaning.\nWithout encountering a true master to transmit the oral instructions,\nEven with a hundred conjectures,\nOne can never apply the work or accomplish the task.\nIs this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs,\nWhile those who attain are as rare as qilin horns?\n\nIn the *jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu,\nWho transmitted the elixir method to me.\nSince then, three transmissions to unworthy recipients,\nThree encounters with calamities—\nEach lasting no more than twenty days.\nRecently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition:\n“One day, if someone comes to loosen your bonds and remove your shackles,\nYou must transmit it to them.\nAll others are not permitted.”",

Yet those to whom I transmitted were none of great influence or mighty power, none capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning, none magnanimous and exceptional, none benevolent and enlightened in the Dao.\n\nAt first, I suffered calamities once, then twice, yet my heart remained unenlightened. Only upon the third did I awaken to my past errors.

Should some devoted seeker, long possessing the bone of immortality, peruse these verses, their wisdom and discernment will naturally awaken, enabling them to trace the text and fathom its meaning. What need have they for this Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In such a case, the transmission is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous imparting.\n\nAs for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse upon seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrously awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its first priority; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately attach to it. Alas, common folk differ in the depth of their karmic conditions and the sharpness of their innate faculties. Even should they hear a single note, they will scatter into divergent views. Thus the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are nothing but the One Vehicle, yet as listeners comprehend according to their capacity, they naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.\n\nHereafter, should any person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. For such a one, a single word may awaken them to the ten thousand dharmas.
