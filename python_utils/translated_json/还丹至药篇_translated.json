  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir*\nOriginally attributed to Xianzhi Yingtu; likely a Song-dynasty work. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Tai Xuan Section.\n\n**Preface to *The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir***\n\nIn my youth, I dwelt within the military camp, my heart set upon obscure passions. By chance, I met a like-minded companion who revealed to me the red furnace. For twenty years, I pursued cultivation in vain—my worldly heart unchanged, my secular desires ever-present. I sought only the gates of profit and self-preservation, never delving into the essence of the golden elixir. Adrift and aimless, I achieved nothing, my steps faltering, my path lost. Only later did I come to trust that the eight minerals held no power to ascend to sagehood, just as the five metals remained but common substances.\n\nThough I failed, I bore no resentment, knowing my studies had not penetrated the profound mechanism, my understanding strayed from the distant truth. Later, after escaping great peril, I chanced upon a perfected one who, moved by my earnest devotion, transmitted to me oral instructions. Bound by oath, he entrusted me with the teaching, swearing it must not be falsely passed on, nor revealed to the uninitiated.\n\nFollowing his instructions, I cultivated and witnessed the divine workings—so subtle and wondrous, unmatched in marvel. Though Xianzhi □ had attained sudden enlightenment, I was struck with awe, fearing first that my merit and conduct were incomplete, and second that my bones were light and my fate fragile. I saw that those who pursued this path were often of noble birth—emperors’ sons, princes, scholars of refined talent, gentlemen of great ability. Countless thousands set their hearts upon it, yet scarcely two or three achieved renown. Truly, this attainment does not favor the highborn; success depends solely on one’s destined portion.\n\nXianzhi, ashamed to be but a common soldier, had nonetheless encountered the immortal formula. I beheld the root of true lead and true mercury, discerned the beginning and end of true water and true fire. The pivotal yellow sprout lay grasped in my palm; the profound mysteries of autumn stone filled my breast. Such fortune surpassed all expectation—one in ten thousand might chance upon it.\n\nThus, Xianzhi reformed his ways and devoted himself to the Dao, forsaking extravagance. Clad in hempen robes, content with simplicity, he cultivated virtue and preserved spirit, aiding those in need. Recently, in leisure, I reflected upon my fellow seekers—how they squandered their minds and wearied their viscera, striving after the elixir’s tortoise, mistaking snakes for dragons. Countless such errors have arisen, all in vain. Unaware of the true root of lead and mercury, they engage in deceptive alchemy. The eight minerals surge wildly; the five metals are scorched and spent.\n\nNow, I humbly offer my humble insights to urge and encourage those of shared aspiration. The great medicine exists; the returned elixir is real. One must achieve inner and outer harmony, heart and mouth in accord. Spare no toil, seek the presence of the enlightened. I inscribe these ten verses to share with fellow practitioners, that together we may ascend beyond the clouds and forever escape the dust.\n\n**The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir**\nComposed by Wu Xuzi Xianzhi Yingtu\n\nLong have I indulged in the supreme art, toiling through twenty springs,\nSifting through immortal scriptures, seeking white mercury in fire’s glow.\nIn a fleeting instant, within water’s depths, I beheld lead’s silver gleam.\nAt last, I knew my lifelong aspiration was not in vain—\nAwakened from the dreamlike body of old illusions.\nFor long years, I burned aloeswood and sandalwood in incense,\nPurifying my heart to pay homage to the Jade Emperor’s truth.\n\nAshamed, a mere soldier risen from the camp’s gate,\nWho could have foreseen the raven’s light illuminating the overturned basin?\nI grasped the mutual overcoming of the five phases,\nDiscerned the dragon and tiger locked in devouring struggle.\nSouth becomes north, and north follows south;\nWhat flees as being is stored as non-being, yet non-being does not cease to be.\nOnly when minds align may one speak of this—\nTo those unfit, the discourse remains unspoken.\n\nTruly, such an encounter is heaven-sent;\nAmid the dust, mortal eyes perceive the cinnabar field.\nThe divine principle, though silent, imparts its near-silence;\nWithin the scrolls of immortal scriptures, I awakened to single-minded clarity.\nThe yellow sprout refined, I beheld within the furnace;\nThe sacred stone cultivated, I held upon my palm.\nThough my heart has escaped the dust, my body remains bound—\nAll worldly affairs now seem but idle distraction.\n\nUpon perusing the *Cantong Qi*, my eyes grew bright:\nThe yellow sprout thrives even in the world’s midst.\nYet all men are deluded, seeking where it cannot be found;\nEach wanders in confusion, journeying far in vain.\nFour substances cycle as root and origin;\nTwo essences harmonize, contracting at the first sprouting.\nThe river chariot gradually transforms the fetal form,\nTurning the green dragon and white tiger into new shapes.\n\nAwakening to true lead, I was struck with awe—\nFearful that amid the dust, my body might await divine judgment.\nMy merit unrefined, my root shallow,\nI dwell among the unenlightened, anxious my bones are too light.\nFrom this moment, I pitied the waters and earth,\nNo longer coveting gold and jade.\nWhen the cauldron of heaven and earth is complete, the years fulfilled,\nI shall carry my elixir gourd toward the Crimson City.\n\nI have heard of the immortal elixir that transcends the world—\nSeekers are as numerous as hemp seeds, yet few attain it.\nThey merely refine the four yellows, attack the eight minerals,\nUnknowing what form the dragon and tiger assume.\nDiligently, they pore over scriptures,\nEndlessly unrolling myriad scrolls.\nFor thirty years, they toil without respite,\nYet frost whitens their temples before true lead is known.\n\nA hundred million seek in vain;\nFrom ancient times to now, this matter is profoundly obscure.\nThe southern work flourishes in the vermilion summer;\nThe northern refinement transforms radiance into white autumn.\nWith bitter resolve, they refine without method;\nWith single-minded devotion, they cultivate without aim.\nThey search to the ends of the earth,\nYet before encountering it, their hair turns white with snow.\n\nThe immortal elixir’s divine art is wondrous and rare;\nFrom ancient times to now, few have attained it.\nThose of shallow wisdom and narrow measure—what can they perceive?\nEven the enlightened ponder, still harboring doubt.\nFrom non-being to being, the divine is unfathomable;\nFrom being to non-being, even sages know not.\nMarvel not that immortal scriptures remain hidden—\nThey are preserved lest the celestial mechanism be revealed.\n\nThe returned elixir is vast and boundless, difficult to fathom;\nWithout destined affinity, one may never encounter it through a thousand lives.\nOnce attained, it must be guarded and concealed—\nDo not equate it with gold and jade.\nWhen refined, the sparrow and swallow dine as phoenixes;\nWhen awakened, the snake and fish feed as dragons.\nSuch divine workings defy description—\nHow could one idly speak of them to the foolish?\n\nKnow that perfection is not easily achieved—\nTruly, it is a thousandfold, ten-thousandfold difficult.\nThe world knows only minor arts of preservation;\nWho would undertake the great returned elixir?\nGold and silver are spoken of with delight,\nBut at the mention of lead and mercury, men seem lost in dreams.\nThus, countless errors arise through the ages—\nBefore fifty, their temples are streaked with gray.\n\n**The Supreme Elixir of the Returned Cinnabar**\n\nWhen one awakens to true lead, the reversal stirs awe;\nIn this dusty world, the body awaits the divine.\nWithout cultivating merit and conduct, the root is shallow,\nAnd among the unenlightened, the bones are deemed light.\n\nFrom this moment, the heart pities the waters and earth;\nFrom now on, no desire lingers for gold and jade.\nWhen the cauldron of heaven and earth is complete and the years are full,\nTake up the elixir gourd and journey to the Crimson City.\n\nIt is said that transcendent cinnabar exists beyond the world—\nSeekers are as numerous as hemp, yet those who attain it are rare.\nThey merely refine the Four Yellows and attack the Eight Stones,\nUnknowing what form the Dragon and Tiger assume.\n\nDiligent only in unrolling scriptures to read,\nStubbornly poring over ten thousand scrolls,\nThey toil for thirty years in vain—\nFrosted temples, yet true lead remains unseen.\n\nA hundred million seek, yet cannot find;\nFrom ancient times to now, this matter runs deep and obscure.\nIn the south, the work aligns with the vermilion summer;\nIn the north, the radiant countenance turns to white autumn.\n\nWith bitter resolve, they refine but find no method;\nWith single-minded devotion, they cultivate—yet how?\nThey search far and wide to the ends of the earth,\nYet before meeting it, their hair is white with snow.\n\nThe divine art of the transcendent elixir is profoundly wondrous;\nFrom ancient times to now, those who attain it are few.\nWhat can shallow wisdom and narrow measure perceive?\nEven the lofty-minded ponder and still harbor doubt.\n\nFrom non-being into being, the divine is unfathomable;\nFrom being into non-being, even sages do not know.\nNo wonder the immortal scriptures remain long concealed—\nTheir transmission fears the leakage of heavenly secrets.\n\nBoundless, the returned elixir is difficult to fathom;\nWithout destined affinity, one may never encounter it through a thousand lives.\nOnce attained, it must be guarded and
