  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Various Heavens for Delivering Lives: The Wondrous Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Various Heavens for Delivering Lives: The Wondrous Scripture*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient* **Lingbao Scriptures***. One fascicle. Base text from:* **Zhengtong Daoist Canon***, Cavern Realms Section, Original Texts Category.*\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, within the Abode of Eternal Joy, seated upon a seven-colored cloud of precious radiance alongside the assembly of the various celestial great sages and flying heavenly divine kings. Then the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: \"Have you heard the sounds of lamentation and weeping from the ten directions and borderlands of the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord bowed his head and respectfully replied to the Celestial Worthy: \"Upon entering this realm for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, I have never heard such sounds of sorrow and sighing in this land. I do not know the reason for this.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy again asked the Dao Lord: \"Have you heard the sounds of stringed music and joyful singing?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord bowed his head and answered: \"In this land, from the time men and women first opened their eyes for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, they have never perceived the people of this kingdom to show signs of aging. Whether man or woman, all share the same appearance. Thus they are born, dwelling in blessings, ever free from sorrow and distress, delighting only in joy. From the moment of their birth, they abide in happiness, never knowing grief.\"\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning smiled and emitted a five-colored radiant light from his mouth, illuminating the land of this kingdom. The true writ of the Numinous Treasure shone brilliantly within the light, its resplendent patterns illuminating and illuminating the five directions.\n\nThe Dao Lord knelt in reverence, bowing his head to gaze upward, wishing to hear its essential teaching.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning replied: \"Have you seen the true writ within the light? This writ emerged in this land during the Dragon Han era. At that time, together with the Highest Great Sage, the Jade Emperor, I composed the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures to deliver the Dao to humanity. Thus, this land was named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, the Abode of Eternal Joy, its numinous sounds resounding to bless the ten directions. Therefore, the men and women of this land enjoy long life, without premature death, never experiencing suffering, never treading the paths of sorrow, never falling into the three evil destinies, never passing through the eight gates of adversity. They know no sounds of lamentation, only the music of joy. To be born in this world and encounter the scriptures and the Dao is truly the karmic affinity of countless kalpas—a life without affliction. How could this not be joyous?\n\nThe reason I smiled without cause just now was to laugh at the people of this land, who do not know whence their joy comes, nor that other lands are filled with sorrow and distress. After I depart, the true writ will be concealed, the kalpas of deliverance will hasten, the Five Turbidities will grow restless, and myriad evils will arise together. Those who, moved by karmic conditions, are reborn into such a world willingly endure sins, cycling through the five destinies, suffering the eight adversities, harming one another, their sorrows and afflictions cutting deeply into their very beings. Never seeing the scriptures, never encountering the sacred writ, they submit to the dictates of life and death—how pitiful and sorrowful!\n\nDeeply moved by such beings, who do not know that their present sufferings are the retribution of past-life karma, I shall now expound the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures to deliver the celestial and human realms. You must diligently apply your mind, receive these teachings with upright intention, and never forget these words.\"\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Great Dao Lord stepped forward, bowed his head, and reverently received the Celestial Worthy’s decree. At that moment, all the assembled sages rejoiced.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then expounded the true writ of the Numinous Treasure in the Abode of Eternal Joy, delivering the Dao to humanity, beginning in this kingdom. At that time, the boundless assembly of perfected great sages from the ten directions and immeasurable worlds, flying heavenly divine kings, and wondrously accomplished perfected ones gathered together as one. The land was paved with molten gold, and the pathways on all four sides were adorned with jade and lapis lazuli, their splendor resplendent and radiant. The Dao and its methods unfolded, delivering countless beings.\n\nThus, this kingdom was named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom. Those born here suffer no harm to their lives, know no mental anguish, and bear no bodily afflictions. Their hearts’ desires are fulfilled, and when their lives end, they are delivered into the Vermilion Mound. At that time, men and women who had cultivated intention were all delivered to transcend the world.\n\nThen the land of the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom was perfected, and the Dao extended to the Eastern Ultimate, the Azure Vault, the Empty Song, and the Great Floating Li Kingdom.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon the Azure Radiance in the Azure Vault, Empty Song, Great Floating Li Kingdom. At that time, the boundless assembly of great sages from the Eastern Ultimate, flying heavenly divine kings, perfected great spirits, the Azure Numinous Elder of the Treasure-Flower Forest, the Lord of the Nine Qi of the Azure Emperor, the Supreme Perfected King, the Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, and the various numinous officials of the Eastern Realm—an immeasurable assembly—gathered as one. The land’s terrain was instantly leveled, without high or low. The earth was entirely of azure jade, and the pathways on all four sides were adorned with gold, silver, and precious ornaments, their splendor radiant and gleaming.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Lord of the Azure Emperor: \"In this kingdom, do people study immortality? What wondrous methods do they possess? Do they know the karmic conditions of past lives?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Emperor bowed his head and respectfully replied to the Celestial Worthy: \"Since entering this realm for nine million nine hundred thousand kalpas, there have been no students of immortality. All naturally do not die. This kingdom possesses all manner of wondrous marvels. There are azure forest trees, their leaves all bearing natural purple script. When the wind stirs the trees, their sounds form cavern hymns, their numinous tones resplendent, ringing through the great void. Above them, nine-colored phoenixes are ever present. When these birds sing, all the men and women of the kingdom bow their heads in reverence to the sound. If one obtains a feather from these birds, they can immediately take flight. The men and women of this kingdom know no aging, no sorrow, never tread the paths of suffering, never experience affliction, delighting only in joy, unaware of the origins of their karmic conditions. To be born in this world is truly the result of past-life causes.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Lord of the Azure Emperor: \"In the Dragon Han era, the true writ of the Numinous Treasure emerged in this kingdom to deliver the Dao to humanity. At that time, the Highest Great Sage inscribed the wondrous scriptures with purple brush upon the azure forest. Thus, when the wind stirs these trees, their sounds form music.\"\n\nThe nine-colored birds perpetually feed upon the leaves of these trees, their bodies adorned with natural patterns—thus, when humans obtain their feathers, they gain the power of flight. In that era, all attained the true Dao.\n\nAfter my passing, the kalpa of deliverance will hasten, wars and disasters will rage, and heavenly beings and mortals will suffer as if wading through mud and ashes, willingly bearing their sins, endlessly revolving through the five paths and eight adversities. Without encountering this present life or beholding the scriptural teachings, their agony would be beyond words. Therefore, I now expound this sutra, that the men and women of this land may know the origins of their undying years, and that the root of deliverance may be planted for future generations. You must apply yourselves diligently and heed my words with utmost clarity.\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Emperor bowed his head in reverence and received the decree, and all the assembled sages rejoiced. At that moment, the Celestial Song of the Azure Heavens resounded throughout the Great Fuli Kingdom, where the land was perfected and the Dao extended to the Southern Culmen.\n\nAt the Southern Culmen, the Radiant Crimson Kingdom of the Huili World and the Three Primordial Caverns of the Vermilion Glow in the Southern Orchard were revealed. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon the crimson clouds in the Radiant Crimson Kingdom of the Chanli World. The boundless assembly of the Southern Infinite Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Vermilion Elder of the Flourishing Yang Treasure, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords of the Crimson Emperor, the Three Qi Elders, the Jade Maidens of the Great Vermilion Palace, and the myriad spirit officials of the Southern Realm gathered as one in the Three Primordial Caverns of the Vermilion Glow. The land of this kingdom was the color of cinnabar fat, perpetually suffused with crimson qi like swirling crimson clouds. Its four-sided stairways were adorned with lapis lazuli and precious treasures, their radiance resplendent, illuminating the entire kingdom.\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning asked the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Crimson Emperor: \"How long is the lifespan of the people in this land?\"\n\nThe Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and replied: \"Since dwelling in this realm for three million three hundred thousand kalpas, we have never heard the sound of sorrow in this land, only witnessed its ageless people.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy inquired further: \"By what wondrous method is this achieved?\"\n\nThe Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: \"This kingdom possesses the Cavern of the Flaming Intestines and the Pool of Fire Refinement. The people visit the fire pool thrice yearly, tempering themselves with the essence of fire to refine their forms, thus attaining agelessness. Above, the Lord of the Southern Palace, who cherishes life, safeguards the registers of human destiny, ensuring no sound of mourning for the dead is heard. We know not the origins of this beginning—we only beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning declared: \"The Cavern of Yang Unity and the Flowing Fire Pool in this land arose when the true writ of the Numinous Treasure first emerged. When the script was not yet manifest, I and the Highest Great Sage, the Jade Emperor, came to this kingdom to refine the true writ with fire, illuminating the forms of the characters until their radiance shone brilliantly, illuminating the five directions. Thus, this land was named the Radiant Crimson Kingdom. The essence of fire flowed into the Cavern of Yang, and so the people temper their bodies in the fire cavern, achieving agelessness—a benefit that endures to this day as the merit of the true writ. This method is most wondrous and profound. Above, the Lord of the Southern Palace, who cherishes life, is appointed to oversee the registers of human destiny, refining the dead to deliver the living. Thus, this kingdom knows no sound of mourning for the dead. To be born in this world is truly bliss!\n\nAfter my passing, the true scriptures will be concealed, the celestial kalpa will hasten, the five turbidities will contend, poison will flow through heavenly beings and mortals, and men and women will suffer as if wading through mud and ashes, willingly bearing their sins, endlessly revolving through the five paths and eight adversities. Without beholding the luminous teachings or encountering the true scriptures, they will know no deliverance. Therefore, I now expound this wondrous sutra for future generations, bestowing upon you the true writ, that the people of this land may recognize the origins of the immortals’ ageless and undying state, and that the root of deliverance may be planted for the men and women of future kalpas. Apply yourselves diligently and do not forget my words.\"\n\nThereupon, the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Crimson Emperor bowed his head in reverence and received the decree. At that moment, the assembled sages paid their respects and departed.\n\nThen the Radiant Crimson Jade Kingdom of the Chanli World was perfected, and the Dao extended to the Western Culmen. At the Western Culmen, the Great Blessing Hall of the Weiluo World and the Western Jade Kingdom were revealed. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat beneath the Seven Treasures Kān Tree on the Floating Mountain of the Yucha Range in the Western Jade Kingdom of the Great Blessing Hall World. The boundless assembly of the Western Infinite Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Radiant Elder of the Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords of the White Emperor, the Seven Qi Elders of Bright Stone, the Supreme White Jade Maidens, and the myriad spirit officials of the Western Realm gathered as one upon the Floating Mountain. The land of this kingdom was paved with white jade, its stairways wrought of gold, and its four sides adorned with precious treasures, their radiance luminous, illuminating the entire kingdom.\n\nThe kingdom’s elegant music and wondrous sounds were exquisitely beautiful, and its myriad marvels—its forests, birds, and beasts—all uttered jade-like verses. Golden pools flowed with essence, nourishing the people of the land. This kingdom was named the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then asked the Heavenly Lord of the White Emperor: \"Why is this named the Land of Ultimate Bliss? What wonders does this land possess that it knows no sorrow?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of the White Emperor bowed and replied: \"Since entering this realm seven million kalpas ago, we have heard only the harmonious sounds of elegant music and never the cries of sorrow from its people. All men and women of this land bear golden countenances. Its forests are filled with Seven Treasures Kān Trees, which bear crimson fruits and white rings. Upon them perch phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds, whose elegant songs resound through the six periods of day and night. Lions and white deer roar and sing in harmony. There are also pools of golden essence and jade elixir, where flying heavenly beings descend thrice yearly to bathe. The flowing essence and mysterious depths universally deliver the boundless—thus, this land is named the Land of Ultimate Bliss. We know not the origins of this beginning—we only beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"In the Dragon Han era, I, along with the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and the Highest Jade Emperor, encountered the true writ of the Numinous Treasure in this land, emerging upon the Floating Mountain of the Azure Void.\"\n\nPhoenixes, peacocks, and flocks of golden-winged birds soar above its peaks. In an instant, a five-colored radiance suddenly illumines the land, revealing all that was hidden in darkness. Upon this empty mountain, I expounded the true writ, composing the ten divisions of wondrous scriptures. Here, the Dharma was first revealed to deliver beings, that its resonant teaching might flow forth to transform later generations, and the Dharma flourish. At that time, both humans and beasts received liberation; thus, the flocks of birds ever emit their extraordinary, elegant songs. Those who hear their voices naturally awaken the Dao-mind, giving rise to wholesome thoughts and cultivating virtuous intentions. All men and women of this land attain the true Dao. Those reborn here have, for seven hundred kalpas past, borne good names recorded in the celestial realms, thereby gaining birth in this land. The land possesses divine birds whose elegant songs resound through the six periods of day and night—thus is it named the Land of Ultimate Bliss. To be born in this world is an immeasurable blessing. After my passing, the true scriptures will be concealed. As the celestial cycles hasten, the land shall be destroyed, and in future lives, beings will suffer in the mire of the Five Afflictions and Eight Adversities. Men and women will die young, their agonies beyond words. Therefore, I now proclaim this sutra, that the people of this land may know the roots of their past-life karmic affinities, and that I may open the ford of deliverance for all future beings. Understand my words clearly and apply them with diligence.\n\nThe Seven Qi Heavenly Lords bowed in reverence to receive the mandate, and all the assembled sages rejoiced without exception.\n\nAt that time, in the world of the Great Blessed Hall of Wei Luo, within the Jade Land of Xi Na, the land was perfected, and the Dao flourished toward the Northern Culmen. In the Land of Yu Shan within the Primordial Blessed Renunciant World of the Northern Culmen, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon a five-colored cloud of mysterious darkness atop the Northern Mound of the Mysterious Hill. The boundless assembly of the Northern Culmen’s Great Saints—Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven’s Cavern-Yin Northern Solitude’s Five Numinous Mysterious Elders, the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Mysterious Nourishing Five Qi Heavenly Lords, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night-Shining Jade Maidens, and the countless officials of the Northern Realm—gathered as one upon the Northern Mound of the Mysterious Hill. The land was congealed of water essence, its paths paved with lapis lazuli. Within the land lay a vast pool, five hundred leagues in breadth. The pool bore flowing-essence jade mushrooms, and at its center stood the Spontaneously Manifest Cavern-Spirit Temple. The temple’s height rivaled the clouds, its perimeter spanning fifty leagues. Within, all was inscribed in golden characters, and the temple’s four faces bore inscriptions. Though the place was shrouded in darkness, with no light upon its four sides, ever resembling a moonless night where none could see, the men and women of the land drank the pool’s waters, their faces like jade cream. They knew no illness, no sorrow, and lived for thirty thousand years without premature death. After their lives ended, their bones did not decay, and even after ten thousand years, they never putrefied. The land had no rites or music, only the knowledge of sincerity. Thus, this land was named the Land Without Affliction.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy asked the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord: \"Why is this called the Land Without Affliction? What wondrous methods does this land possess?\"\n\nThe Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and replied: \"Since entering this realm five million kalpas ago, with each kalpa’s passage, I have witnessed the Cavern-Spirit Temple suddenly brighten, only to darken again once the kalpa ends. Beneath the temple lies a frigid pool, where all the land’s men and women drink. Their faces are like jade, free of aging, unaware of sickness or pain. They live out their years, and when they die, their bodies do not decay. Thus, it is called the Land Without Affliction. The men and women of this land only know rebirth, not its source, yet attain such longevity. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy smiled, and a five-colored radiance issued from his mouth, illuminating the entire land. The Cavern-Spirit Temple became brilliantly visible, its four sides transparent as the midday sun. The city and pool gleamed with resplendent patterns, beyond description. The people of the land rejoiced immeasurably.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"The true writ of the Numinous Treasure once emerged in this land to deliver beings. I sealed the celestial writ within this temple, hence its name, the Cavern-Spirit Temple. Beneath it lies a frigid pool, wholly infused with numinous essence, so that those who drink its waters live without death. After my passing, this temple’s scriptures shall return to the Boundless Heaven of Yu Shan. As the celestial cycles hasten, myriad calamities will cut short the lives of heavenly beings. In future lives, they will suffer in the mire, bereft of the scriptures’ teaching, adrift in the Five Afflictions, unbearable to witness. Therefore, I now proclaim this sutra, that the people of this land may know the origins of their karmic affinities, and that I may open the ford of deliverance for future men and women. Those with wholesome hearts shall receive these texts, that they may live and be delivered from suffering amid the myriad calamities. Understand my words clearly, receive them with sincerity, and practice them diligently. Do not grow lax and thereby mislead future beings.\"\n\nThe Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed to receive the mandate, and all within the land rejoiced without exception.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord: \"The Five Elder Emperor Lords and the Numinous Treasure share karmic affinities across billions of kalpas, meeting life after life without cease in their teaching and transformation. Since the true writ was entrusted to the Five Elder Emperor Lords, each has received a portion of the true scriptures and wondrous instructions, installed to guard the five directions. The lands where they dwell are filled with blessings and virtue, so that their men and women enjoy long lives, free from premature death. All fulfill their years, knowing no sorrow or suffering, encountering no Eight Adversities. Their forms do not age, their lands know no lamentation, only the elegant sounds of wondrous music. The land’s joy endures kalpa after kalpa. Yet in other lands and foreign realms where blessings and virtue do not reach, men and women, bereft of the scriptures’ teaching, know not their past lives. They drift through birth and death, from east to west, revolving through the Five Paths without hope of return. That blessings are not universal is most lamentable. Now, I shall once more broadly open the Dharma’s teaching to universally deliver the heavens, that the men and women of these sundry lands and border regions may all turn their hearts toward me, enter my Dharma-gate, and be delivered from the Eight Adversities and manifold sufferings. They shall behold all wholesome qualities, transform their minds without exception, and their seven generations of ancestors shall receive its blessings. They shall be reborn among humans, and with blessings universally bestowed, the world shall rejoice.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy perfected the lands of the Five Directions, delivering all people, that each might receive the luminous teaching. Each one aroused good thoughts and kind intentions, contemplating the Great Dharma, transgressing neither scriptures nor precepts, treading no evil paths, nor committing unlawful acts, their bodies unstained by the slightest defilement. Universally cultivating a mind of compassion, they revered and obeyed the divine spirits, honored the aged and cherished the young, their conduct aligning with the natural order, thereby securing long life and enduring form, free from decline and aging.\n\nAs the Dharma’s resonance spread forth, all heavens looked up in veneration. Even in those sundry lands, border regions, and distant realms where life was brief and blessings did not reach—wherever the Dao’s presence was heard—all attained deliverance, their lifespans extended, and none failed to rejoice. At that time, men and women alike came forth to take refuge.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then returned to the Abode of Eternal Joy. From all those sundry lands, great and small, the entire populace came forth, an influx that could not be restrained. For three days and three nights, the Heavenly Worthy sealed the celestial radiance, causing the light to cease shining. A pyre was raised upon high ground, some two hundred *zhang* in height. The Heavenly Worthy sat atop the pyre and set himself ablaze. The fire’s glow illuminated the Four Directions, brightly illuminating all lands.\n\nFrom afar, men and women saw the Heavenly Worthy seated in the flames, yet had no means to approach and lay bare their hearts. The Heavenly Worthy, desiring to observe their resolve, addressed those who had come: \"If you seek long life, enter the fire and receive the Dharma from me.\" Among those who yearned for the Great Dharma with sincere devotion, seventy-two thousand four hundred and fifty persons cast themselves into the flames, all reaching the presence of the Dao. The Heavenly Worthy then conferred upon them the scriptural teachings within the fire, bestowing the Dharma as they entered. All attained deliverance and departed, their forms concealed.\n\nThe remaining four hundred thousand, seeing those who entered did not emerge, believed them to have perished in the flames. Thus, they withdrew and returned to their homelands. Those who had entered the fire to receive deliverance had already returned to their homes by the time the others arrived. Upon meeting again, they were filled with remorse and lamentation, their regret too late to amend. Those who had received deliverance gained long life, their bodies free from suffering, their forms unaging, living for thirty thousand years before passing away. Even those who, though not yet delivered, cultivated the Dharma with diligent devotion, all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: \"In the Dragon Han era, I was the Eternal Lord of Formless Existence, manifesting to teach and transform. At that time, heaven and earth existed, the sun and moon shone with radiance, and the Three Luminaries were complete. There were men and women, birth and death, and though yin and yang were present, there were no rites or canons, nor the five flavors or garments—all arose in primordial chaos. Through the Dao’s transformative instruction, they gradually awakened, coming to know and practice benevolence and righteousness, turning their hearts in faith and devotion. Thus, their lifespans were all extended. Those who did not believe in the Dharma had brief lives.\n\nAfter my departure, heaven and earth collapsed, plunging into vast obscurity. For countless eons, there was no light; above, no celestial hues remained, and below, no abysses endured. Wind and marsh pervaded the void, dark and dim, formless and shadowless, boundless and infinite. This chaotic, timeless state was called the Era of Prolonged Stability. When the Crimson Radiance dawned, heaven and earth were restored, yin and yang emerged, and people were complete, yet birth and death remained.\n\nI manifested again, known as the Nameless Lord, teaching with the Lingbao scriptures to deliver the heavens and humanity. At that time, men and women who cultivated the Dharma with sincere devotion, upholding the scriptures and precepts without negligence, all attained the true Dao, their bones and flesh ascending together, moving freely through the void. Even those who had not yet attained the Dao enjoyed long life, ascending to heavenly realms upon death, reborn in successive lives, their wheel of existence unbroken, eventually attaining immortality.\n\nAfter my departure, at the close of one kalpa, heaven and earth were again destroyed, plunging into darkness. For five kalpas, all was dim and obscure, the Three Qi intermingled in chaos, borne by the turning of the cosmic wheel. When the Kaihuang era arrived, the true scriptures of Lingbao opened the Three Luminaries, heaven and earth were restored, the Five Scriptures shone brilliantly, and the sun, moon, and stars gleamed anew. The four seasons and five phases arose with yin and yang.\n\nI then manifested in the Azure Heaven as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, spreading the Dharma’s teaching and perfecting all heavens. People then were simple and unadorned, conducting their affairs by knotted cords. There were no rites or canons, no five flavors, no clothing, no five colors, no patterns or texts. They dwelled naked in the open, mingling with birds and beasts. Through the Dao’s transformative instruction, their minds gradually awakened, coming to know benevolence and righteousness. Ritual and music flourished, they covered their bodies and partook of flavors, integrating the five phases. Thus, I proclaimed the teaching, propagating the Dharma’s resonance, widely bestowing scriptures, exhorting and admonishing the ignorant, guiding them to turn their hearts in faith and gradually enter the Dharma-gate.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy journeyed to the banks of the Western River and sat upon the Weak Waters. From his mouth issued a five-colored radiance, universally illuminating all heavens and the lands of the Four Directions, so that all beheld the light. The Heavenly Worthy divided his form into a million, appearing simultaneously in every place. Men and women everywhere saw the Heavenly Worthy within the five-colored light, as if present in one location. Wherever he manifested, young and old, men and women, all came to bow in reverence. The Heavenly Worthy, adapting to each land, emitted from his mouth the five true scriptures of Lingbao, their luminous splendor too dazzling to behold. He expounded the Ten Wondrous Scriptures and conferred prohibitive precepts.\n\nHe proclaimed to the men and women: \"If any desire long life, come forth to inscribe your names, etching them upon iron tablets with cinnabar, swearing oaths in blood from bitten arms, pledging sincere devotion before receiving the Dharma and departing.\" At that time, men and women, young and old, from the Four Directions and borderlands, all turned their hearts in devotion. Each brought gold, silver, brocade, and multicolored silks, pearls, jade, and treasures beyond count, coming before the Heavenly Worthy. They prostrated themselves to receive the Dharma and precepts, reverently upholding the wondrous scriptures. For seven days and seven nights, the radiant light shone brightly, and the Four Directions returned to normal. The treasures and pledges of all lands filled the realm.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then bestowed alms upon the destitute, filling the hungry and sustaining the rich, equalizing wealth and poverty so that none harbored resentment. The heavens reviewed the records, and those whose names were inscribed in the ledgers of good deeds were all delivered across the world, soaring through the great void. Those who first entered the Dharma gate all attained longevity of thirty-six thousand years.\n\nBy the first year of the Supreme August Era, the forms of the celestial men and women reverted to pure simplicity, yet their hearts gradually grew lax and corrupt. Fearing their decline and the incompleteness of the true teaching, I thus manifested in every land to fulfill all hearts. After my passing, within half a kalpa, the men and women of future generations will see their hearts corrupted, growing mutually suspicious and divided. They will disbelieve the scriptural teachings, giving rise to jealousy and harm, competing for supremacy, and attacking one another. Their words will contradict their hearts; they will create their own laws, disrespecting heaven and earth, scorning the divine, killing living beings, and making licentious sacrifices to seek perverse spirits. Men and women will curse one another, indulging in lust and wantonness, stealing without cause. Unwilling to accept their past lives, they will bring harm upon themselves, entering evil destinies and treading paths of suffering. Their lifespans will be short, and they will be afflicted by sorrow, revolving endlessly through the Three Paths and Five Realms. Born only to die, their karmic retribution will follow them, their flesh and blood parted—truly a grievous fate.\n\nNow I expound this scripture to deliver those of future generations who can be delivered. Those of good heart, listen clearly and remember my words well.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord bowed his head in reverence and received the command.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: I have surveyed all the heavens, from kalpas past to this day. The lofty sages and great divine spirits who attained the Dao in the heavens above, along with all the perfected ones and flying immortals of the Three Clarities, Nine Palaces, and Five Peaks, have all received deliverance through the *Lingbao* scriptures, thereby becoming true immortals. Next, I observed the Vermilion Palace of the Southern Mound and the Ninefold Numinous Blessing Hall, where the celestial provisions of past-life blessings nourish the souls of the naturally fed. None among them had not, in their past lives, made offerings to the *Lingbao*, practiced fasting and precepts, awakened the mind of spontaneity, and performed meritorious deeds, thereby attaining deliverance and ascending to the Blessing Hall to receive the celestial provisions.\n\nThis scripture is most venerable and wondrous, delivering countless beings. When great kalpas cycle and the heavens collapse, the earth sinks, the four seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve, and the myriad Daoist arts perish—yet this scripture alone endures, its Dharma unbroken. All other miscellaneous arts—methods of guiding and nourishing life, techniques of transformation, medical formulas, and scattered worldly practices—belong to the Six Heavens and the Desire Realm. When a minor kalpa arrives, all such arts vanish without remnant.\n\nAs for the miscellaneous talismans and diagrams of the Great Clarity, the *Scriptures of the Great Peace*, and various minor Daoist arts and scriptures, they circulate among the eighteen heavens above and below within the Form Realm. When the great kalpa turns, heaven and earth transform, and these texts too will perish without remnant.\n\nThe supreme scriptures of the Jade Clarity—*Three Caverns Divine Scriptures*, *Divine Perfected Tiger Scripts*, *Golden Writings and Jade Characters*, and *Lingbao True Scriptures*—all emanate from the Primordial Beginning, residing above the twenty-eight heavens in the formless realm. When the great kalpa cycles, these texts return to the Seven Jeweled Mystic Terrace of Jade Capital Mountain in the Supreme Primordial Great Luo Heaven, untouched by calamity. The Great Luo Heaven is the highest of the fifty-five myriad, five thousand, five hundred, and fifty-five heavens.\n\nThus, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, *Mystic Mystery of the Lingbao*, *Cavernous Void*, and *Cavernous Nonbeing*—the spontaneous texts—perish and arise with the cosmic cycles, encompassing all scriptures and serving as the foundation of all heavens. Those who cultivate them diligently attain divine transcendence, eternal life, and deliverance across the world, ascending in broad daylight to soar through the void. Those who uphold them with reverence and devotion will see their seven ancestors reborn in heaven, becoming wheel-turning sage kings, their blessings unbroken through generations, bound to good karmic conditions.\n\n**Numinous Writings of the Heavens: Chapters on Delivering Lives**\n\n**Chapter on the Numinous Writings of the Nine Qi Heavens of the East for Delivering Lives**\nIn the Eastern Palace of Radiance, the perfected ones and jade maidens chant its verses to harmonize form and soul, record qi to preserve life, retain spirit to attain transcendence—these are the subtle words of the Primordial Beginning’s spontaneity.\n\nThe Eastern Radiance exhales numinous winds,\nThe Western Palace harmonizes with jade sounds.\nThe two qi conjoin in the empty cavern,\nFrom the Great Void, the heart arises.\nThe Numinous Writings unfurl like long branches,\nThe Treasure Scripts flourish in emerald forests.\nPhoenix songs echo through the heavens,\nChanted in rhythm with the six hours.\nAbove stands the Youth Who Delivers Lives,\nDispelling night and illuminating the long darkness.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, he preserves the brightness of form,\nYet remains too subtle to trace.\nHe records the undying years,\nFloating and sinking with the cosmic cycles.\nSun and moon illuminate the numinous soul,\nThe celestial pivot turns to the southeast.\nThe nine stars cast their shadows,\nTreasure blossoms bloom in the five hearts.\nThere exists an undecaying spirit,\nSealed with me in cinnabar and gold.\nThe Red Writings tally the essence of qi,\nThe Jade Instructions hold profound mystery.\nIn the Vermilion Palace lie the records,\nNo demon or spirit can invade.\nThis chapter originates from the Primordial Beginning’s Eastern Radiance Azure Palace, sealed by the Great Lord Azure Youth in a treasure casket of azure jade, stamped with the Primordial Beginning’s Nine Qi Seal, and guarded by nine jade maidens of the azure waist. Those who recite it harmonize form and soul, stabilize life and retain spirit, with the Eight Effulgences as their guardians, ensuring their bodies endure forever. Their seven ancestors rejoice together, all entering the gate of blessings.\n\n**Jade Chapter on the Numinous Writings of the Three Qi Vermilion Heavens of the South for Delivering Lives**\nIn the

The four heavens’ sagely perfected ones and jade maidens constantly chant them to retain spirit and stabilize qi, harmonizing form and soul. Their elegant sounds are wondrous and peerless, their wisdom penetrating the empty void. Thus, when the upright gentlemen of the four directions obtain these dharma sounds, they spontaneously attain the Dao and the real, their lifespans become long and far-reaching. On the day their fate is exhausted, they ascend directly to the heavens, their generations never ceasing, becoming Wheel-Turning Sagely Kings. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, the most venerable among all scriptures, a gateway of the Great Vehicle for nurturing life and protecting the dead.\n\nIf in future lives, the hearts of men and women turn against their destiny, not being as pure and sincere as in this life, constantly harboring doubt and jealousy toward those surpassing them, contending for merit and fame, mutually attacking and harming, self-injuring their years and fate, not speaking of their own evil and perverse deeds, but instead claiming the scriptural teachings lack numinous efficacy—after I depart, the scriptures and Dao will return to the Great Veil Heaven above the Three Realms. Gazing from afar at their hearts, among them there will surely be those who can be delivered. You must diligently propagate and transform, enabling those with the heart to hear the Dharma, delivering them from the roots of suffering and affliction, so their bodies behold the light and encounter good karmic conditions. Those who do not believe and turn toward it bring upon themselves the path of fire and ashes, drifting and trailing through the Five Paths of birth and death, with no time of liberation. How earnestly I exhort you, thus repeatedly admonishing, unable to bear seeing future generations’ obstinate folly and pitiful state. Therefore, I leave this luminous warning: be diligent in practice and do not slacken.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, the Utmost Real Venerable Spirits, all bow their heads in reverence, receive the command, and depart.\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Writings of the Heavens for Delivering Lives from the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Various Heavens for Delivering Lives: The Wondrous Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Various Heavens for Delivering Lives: The Wondrous Scripture*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient* **Lingbao Scriptures***. One fascicle. Base text from:* **Zhengtong Daoist Canon***, Cavern Realms Section, Original Texts Category.*\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning was in the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, within the Abode of Eternal Joy, seated upon a seven-colored cloud of precious radiance alongside the assembly of the various celestial great sages and flying heavenly divine kings. Then the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: \"Have you heard the sounds of lamentation and weeping from the ten directions and borderlands of the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord bowed his head and respectfully replied to the Celestial Worthy: \"Upon entering this realm for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, I have never heard such sounds of sorrow and sighing in this land. I do not know the reason for this.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy again asked the Dao Lord: \"Have you heard the sounds of stringed music and joyful singing?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord bowed his head and answered: \"In this land, from the time men and women first opened their eyes for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, they have never perceived the people of this kingdom to show signs of aging. Whether man or woman, all share the same appearance. Thus they are born, dwelling in blessings, ever free from sorrow and distress, delighting only in joy. From the moment of their birth, they abide in happiness, never knowing grief.\"\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning smiled and emitted a five-colored radiant light from his mouth, illuminating the land of this kingdom. The true writ of the Numinous Treasure shone brilliantly within the light, its resplendent patterns illuminating and illuminating the five directions.\n\nThe Dao Lord knelt in reverence, bowing his head to gaze upward, wishing to hear its essential teaching.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning replied: \"Have you seen the true writ within the light? This writ emerged in this land during the Dragon Han era. At that time, together with the Highest Great Sage, the Jade Emperor, I composed the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures to deliver the Dao to humanity. Thus, this land was named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom, the Abode of Eternal Joy, its numinous sounds resounding to bless the ten directions. Therefore, the men and women of this land enjoy long life, without premature death, never experiencing suffering, never treading the paths of sorrow, never falling into the three evil destinies, never passing through the eight gates of adversity. They know no sounds of lamentation, only the music of joy. To be born in this world and encounter the scriptures and the Dao is truly the karmic affinity of countless kalpas—a life without affliction. How could this not be joyous?\n\nThe reason I smiled without cause just now was to laugh at the people of this land, who do not know whence their joy comes, nor that other lands are filled with sorrow and distress. After I depart, the true writ will be concealed, the kalpas of deliverance will hasten, the Five Turbidities will grow restless, and myriad evils will arise together. Those who, moved by karmic conditions, are reborn into such a world willingly endure sins, cycling through the five destinies, suffering the eight adversities, harming one another, their sorrows and afflictions cutting deeply into their very beings. Never seeing the scriptures, never encountering the sacred writ, they submit to the dictates of life and death—how pitiful and sorrowful!\n\nDeeply moved by such beings, who do not know that their present sufferings are the retribution of past-life karma, I shall now expound the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures to deliver the celestial and human realms. You must diligently apply your mind, receive these teachings with upright intention, and never forget these words.\"\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Great Dao Lord stepped forward, bowed his head, and reverently received the Celestial Worthy’s decree. At that moment, all the assembled sages rejoiced.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then expounded the true writ of the Numinous Treasure in the Abode of Eternal Joy, delivering the Dao to humanity, beginning in this kingdom. At that time, the boundless assembly of perfected great sages from the ten directions and immeasurable worlds, flying heavenly divine kings, and wondrously accomplished perfected ones gathered together as one. The land was paved with molten gold, and the pathways on all four sides were adorned with jade and lapis lazuli, their splendor resplendent and radiant. The Dao and its methods unfolded, delivering countless beings.\n\nThus, this kingdom was named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom. Those born here suffer no harm to their lives, know no mental anguish, and bear no bodily afflictions. Their hearts’ desires are fulfilled, and when their lives end, they are delivered into the Vermilion Mound. At that time, men and women who had cultivated intention were all delivered to transcend the world.\n\nThen the land of the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom was perfected, and the Dao extended to the Eastern Ultimate, the Azure Vault, the Empty Song, and the Great Floating Li Kingdom.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon the Azure Radiance in the Azure Vault, Empty Song, Great Floating Li Kingdom. At that time, the boundless assembly of great sages from the Eastern Ultimate, flying heavenly divine kings, perfected great spirits, the Azure Numinous Elder of the Treasure-Flower Forest, the Lord of the Nine Qi of the Azure Emperor, the Supreme Perfected King, the Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, and the various numinous officials of the Eastern Realm—an immeasurable assembly—gathered as one. The land’s terrain was instantly leveled, without high or low. The earth was entirely of azure jade, and the pathways on all four sides were adorned with gold, silver, and precious ornaments, their splendor radiant and gleaming.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Lord of the Azure Emperor: \"In this kingdom, do people study immortality? What wondrous methods do they possess? Do they know the karmic conditions of past lives?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Emperor bowed his head and respectfully replied to the Celestial Worthy: \"Since entering this realm for nine million nine hundred thousand kalpas, there have been no students of immortality. All naturally do not die. This kingdom possesses all manner of wondrous marvels. There are azure forest trees, their leaves all bearing natural purple script. When the wind stirs the trees, their sounds form cavern hymns, their numinous tones resplendent, ringing through the great void. Above them, nine-colored phoenixes are ever present. When these birds sing, all the men and women of the kingdom bow their heads in reverence to the sound. If one obtains a feather from these birds, they can immediately take flight. The men and women of this kingdom know no aging, no sorrow, never tread the paths of suffering, never experience affliction, delighting only in joy, unaware of the origins of their karmic conditions. To be born in this world is truly the result of past-life causes.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning addressed the Lord of the Azure Emperor: \"In the Dragon Han era, the true writ of the Numinous Treasure emerged in this kingdom to deliver the Dao to humanity. At that time, the Highest Great Sage inscribed the wondrous scriptures with purple brush upon the azure forest. Thus, when the wind stirs these trees, their sounds form music.\"",

In that era, all attained the true Dao.\n\nAfter my passing, the kalpa of deliverance will hasten, wars and disasters will rage, and heavenly beings and mortals will suffer as if wading through mud and ashes, willingly bearing their sins, endlessly revolving through the five paths and eight adversities. Without encountering this present life or beholding the scriptural teachings, their agony would be beyond words. Therefore, I now expound this sutra, that the men and women of this land may know the origins of their undying years, and that the root of deliverance may be planted for future generations. You must apply yourselves diligently and heed my words with utmost clarity.\n\nThe Lord of the Azure Emperor bowed his head in reverence and received the decree, and all the assembled sages rejoiced. At that moment, the Celestial Song of the Azure Heavens resounded throughout the Great Fuli Kingdom, where the land was perfected and the Dao extended to the Southern Culmen.\n\nAt the Southern Culmen, the Radiant Crimson Kingdom of the Huili World and the Three Primordial Caverns of the Vermilion Glow in the Southern Orchard were revealed. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon the crimson clouds in the Radiant Crimson Kingdom of the Chanli World. The boundless assembly of the Southern Infinite Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Vermilion Elder of the Flourishing Yang Treasure, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords of the Crimson Emperor, the Three Qi Elders, the Jade Maidens of the Great Vermilion Palace, and the myriad spirit officials of the Southern Realm gathered as one in the Three Primordial Caverns of the Vermilion Glow. The land of this kingdom was the color of cinnabar fat, perpetually suffused with crimson qi like swirling crimson clouds. Its four-sided stairways were adorned with lapis lazuli and precious treasures, their radiance resplendent, illuminating the entire kingdom.\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning asked the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Crimson Emperor: \"How long is the lifespan of the people in this land?\"\n\nThe Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and replied: \"Since dwelling in this realm for three million three hundred thousand kalpas, we have never heard the sound of sorrow in this land, only witnessed its ageless people.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy inquired further: \"By what wondrous method is this achieved?\"\n\nThe Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: \"This kingdom possesses the Cavern of the Flaming Intestines and the Pool of Fire Refinement. The people visit the fire pool thrice yearly, tempering themselves with the essence of fire to refine their forms, thus attaining agelessness. Above, the Lord of the Southern Palace, who cherishes life, safeguards the registers of human destiny, ensuring no sound of mourning for the dead is heard. We know not the origins of this beginning—we only beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning declared: \"The Cavern of Yang Unity and the Flowing Fire Pool in this land arose when the true writ of the Numinous Treasure first emerged. When the script was not yet manifest, I and the Highest Great Sage, the Jade Emperor, came to this kingdom to refine the true writ with fire, illuminating the forms of the characters until their radiance shone brilliantly, illuminating the five directions. Thus, this land was named the Radiant Crimson Kingdom. The essence of fire flowed into the Cavern of Yang, and so the people temper their bodies in the fire cavern, achieving agelessness—a benefit that endures to this day as the merit of the true writ. This method is most wondrous and profound. Above, the Lord of the Southern Palace, who cherishes life, is appointed to oversee the registers of human destiny, refining the dead to deliver the living. Thus, this kingdom knows no sound of mourning for the dead. To be born in this world is truly bliss!\n\nAfter my passing, the true scriptures will be concealed, the celestial kalpa will hasten, the five turbidities will contend, poison will flow through heavenly beings and mortals, and men and women will suffer as if wading through mud and ashes, willingly bearing their sins, endlessly revolving through the five paths and eight adversities. Without beholding the luminous teachings or encountering the true scriptures, they will know no deliverance. Therefore, I now expound this wondrous sutra for future generations, bestowing upon you the true writ, that the people of this land may recognize the origins of the immortals’ ageless and undying state, and that the root of deliverance may be planted for the men and women of future kalpas. Apply yourselves diligently and do not forget my words.\"\n\nThereupon, the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Crimson Emperor bowed his head in reverence and received the decree. At that moment, the assembled sages paid their respects and departed.\n\nThen the Radiant Crimson Jade Kingdom of the Chanli World was perfected, and the Dao extended to the Western Culmen. At the Western Culmen, the Great Blessing Hall of the Weiluo World and the Western Jade Kingdom were revealed. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat beneath the Seven Treasures Kān Tree on the Floating Mountain of the Yucha Range in the Western Jade Kingdom of the Great Blessing Hall World. The boundless assembly of the Western Infinite Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Radiant Elder of the Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords of the White Emperor, the Seven Qi Elders of Bright Stone, the Supreme White Jade Maidens, and the myriad spirit officials of the Western Realm gathered as one upon the Floating Mountain. The land of this kingdom was paved with white jade, its stairways wrought of gold, and its four sides adorned with precious treasures, their radiance luminous, illuminating the entire kingdom.\n\nThe kingdom’s elegant music and wondrous sounds were exquisitely beautiful, and its myriad marvels—its forests, birds, and beasts—all uttered jade-like verses. Golden pools flowed with essence, nourishing the people of the land. This kingdom was named the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then asked the Heavenly Lord of the White Emperor: \"Why is this named the Land of Ultimate Bliss? What wonders does this land possess that it knows no sorrow?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of the White Emperor bowed and replied: \"Since entering this realm seven million kalpas ago, we have heard only the harmonious sounds of elegant music and never the cries of sorrow from its people. All men and women of this land bear golden countenances. Its forests are filled with Seven Treasures Kān Trees, which bear crimson fruits and white rings. Upon them perch phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds, whose elegant songs resound through the six periods of day and night. Lions and white deer roar and sing in harmony. There are also pools of golden essence and jade elixir, where flying heavenly beings descend thrice yearly to bathe. The flowing essence and mysterious depths universally deliver the boundless—thus, this land is named the Land of Ultimate Bliss. We know not the origins of this beginning—we only beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"In the Dragon Han era, I, along with the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning and the Highest Jade Emperor, encountered the true writ of the Numinous Treasure in this land, emerging upon the Floating Mountain of the Azure Void.\"",
      "overlap_context": "unaware of the origins of their karmic conditions.

At that time, the Highest Great Sage inscribed the wondrous scriptures with purple brush upon the azure forest. Thus, when the wind stirs these trees, their sounds form music.\"",

      "translated_text": "Phoenixes, peacocks, and flocks of golden-winged birds soar above its peaks. In an instant, a five-colored radiance suddenly illumines the land, revealing all that was hidden in darkness. Upon this empty mountain, I expounded the true writ, composing the ten divisions of wondrous scriptures. Here, the Dharma was first revealed to deliver beings, that its resonant teaching might flow forth to transform later generations, and the Dharma flourish. At that time, both humans and beasts received liberation; thus, the flocks of birds ever emit their extraordinary, elegant songs. Those who hear their voices naturally awaken the Dao-mind, giving rise to wholesome thoughts and cultivating virtuous intentions. All men and women of this land attain the true Dao. Those reborn here have, for seven hundred kalpas past, borne good names recorded in the celestial realms, thereby gaining birth in this land. The land possesses divine birds whose elegant songs resound through the six periods of day and night—thus is it named the Land of Ultimate Bliss. To be born in this world is an immeasurable blessing. After my passing, the true scriptures will be concealed. As the celestial cycles hasten, the land shall be destroyed, and in future lives, beings will suffer in the mire of the Five Afflictions and Eight Adversities. Men and women will die young, their agonies beyond words. Therefore, I now proclaim this sutra, that the people of this land may know the roots of their past-life karmic affinities, and that I may open the ford of deliverance for all future beings. Understand my words clearly and apply them with diligence.\n\nThe Seven Qi Heavenly Lords bowed in reverence to receive the mandate, and all the assembled sages rejoiced without exception.\n\nAt that time, in the world of the Great Blessed Hall of Wei Luo, within the Jade Land of Xi Na, the land was perfected, and the Dao flourished toward the Northern Culmen. In the Land of Yu Shan within the Primordial Blessed Renunciant World of the Northern Culmen, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning sat upon a five-colored cloud of mysterious darkness atop the Northern Mound of the Mysterious Hill. The boundless assembly of the Northern Culmen’s Great Saints—Flying Heavenly Kings, Perfected Great Spirits, the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven’s Cavern-Yin Northern Solitude’s Five Numinous Mysterious Elders, the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Mysterious Nourishing Five Qi Heavenly Lords, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night-Shining Jade Maidens, and the countless officials of the Northern Realm—gathered as one upon the Northern Mound of the Mysterious Hill. The land was congealed of water essence, its paths paved with lapis lazuli. Within the land lay a vast pool, five hundred leagues in breadth. The pool bore flowing-essence jade mushrooms, and at its center stood the Spontaneously Manifest Cavern-Spirit Temple. The temple’s height rivaled the clouds, its perimeter spanning fifty leagues. Within, all was inscribed in golden characters, and the temple’s four faces bore inscriptions. Though the place was shrouded in darkness, with no light upon its four sides, ever resembling a moonless night where none could see, the men and women of the land drank the pool’s waters, their faces like jade cream. They knew no illness, no sorrow, and lived for thirty thousand years without premature death. After their lives ended, their bones did not decay, and even after ten thousand years, they never putrefied. The land had no rites or music, only the knowledge of sincerity. Thus, this land was named the Land Without Affliction.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy asked the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord: \"Why is this called the Land Without Affliction? What wondrous methods does this land possess?\"\n\nThe Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and replied: \"Since entering this realm five million kalpas ago, with each kalpa’s passage, I have witnessed the Cavern-Spirit Temple suddenly brighten, only to darken again once the kalpa ends. Beneath the temple lies a frigid pool, where all the land’s men and women drink. Their faces are like jade, free of aging, unaware of sickness or pain. They live out their years, and when they die, their bodies do not decay. Thus, it is called the Land Without Affliction. The men and women of this land only know rebirth, not its source, yet attain such longevity. I beseech the Celestial Worthy to reveal what we have not yet understood.\"\n\nThe Celestial Worthy smiled, and a five-colored radiance issued from his mouth, illuminating the entire land. The Cavern-Spirit Temple became brilliantly visible, its four sides transparent as the midday sun. The city and pool gleamed with resplendent patterns, beyond description. The people of the land rejoiced immeasurably.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy said: \"The true writ of the Numinous Treasure once emerged in this land to deliver beings. I sealed the celestial writ within this temple, hence its name, the Cavern-Spirit Temple. Beneath it lies a frigid pool, wholly infused with numinous essence, so that those who drink its waters live without death. After my passing, this temple’s scriptures shall return to the Boundless Heaven of Yu Shan. As the celestial cycles hasten, myriad calamities will cut short the lives of heavenly beings. In future lives, they will suffer in the mire, bereft of the scriptures’ teaching, adrift in the Five Afflictions, unbearable to witness. Therefore, I now proclaim this sutra, that the people of this land may know the origins of their karmic affinities, and that I may open the ford of deliverance for future men and women. Those with wholesome hearts shall receive these texts, that they may live and be delivered from suffering amid the myriad calamities. Understand my words clearly, receive them with sincerity, and practice them diligently. Do not grow lax and thereby mislead future beings.\"\n\nThe Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed to receive the mandate, and all within the land rejoiced without exception.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord: \"The Five Elder Emperor Lords and the Numinous Treasure share karmic affinities across billions of kalpas, meeting life after life without cease in their teaching and transformation. Since the true writ was entrusted to the Five Elder Emperor Lords, each has received a portion of the true scriptures and wondrous instructions, installed to guard the five directions. The lands where they dwell are filled with blessings and virtue, so that their men and women enjoy long lives, free from premature death. All fulfill their years, knowing no sorrow or suffering, encountering no Eight Adversities. Their forms do not age, their lands know no lamentation, only the elegant sounds of wondrous music. The land’s joy endures kalpa after kalpa. Yet in other lands and foreign realms where blessings and virtue do not reach, men and women, bereft of the scriptures’ teaching, know not their past lives. They drift through birth and death, from east to west, revolving through the Five Paths without hope of return. That blessings are not universal is most lamentable. Now, I shall once more broadly open the Dharma’s teaching to universally deliver the heavens, that the men and women of these sundry lands and border regions may all turn their hearts toward me, enter my Dharma-gate, and be delivered from the Eight Adversities and manifold sufferings. They shall behold all wholesome qualities, transform their minds without exception, and their seven generations of ancestors shall receive its blessings. They shall be reborn among humans, and with blessings universally bestowed, the world shall rejoice.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy perfected the lands of the Five Directions, delivering all people, that each might receive the luminous teaching. Each one aroused good thoughts and kind intentions, contemplating the Great Dharma, transgressing neither scriptures nor precepts, treading no evil paths, nor committing unlawful acts, their bodies unstained by the slightest defilement. Universally cultivating a mind of compassion, they revered and obeyed the divine spirits, honored the aged and cherished the young, their conduct aligning with the natural order, thereby securing long life and enduring form, free from decline and aging.\n\nAs the Dharma’s resonance spread forth, all heavens looked up in veneration. Even in those sundry lands, border regions, and distant realms where life was brief and blessings did not reach—wherever the Dao’s presence was heard—all attained deliverance, their lifespans extended, and none failed to rejoice. At that time, men and women alike came forth to take refuge.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then returned to the Abode of Eternal Joy. From all those sundry lands, great and small, the entire populace came forth, an influx that could not be restrained. For three days and three nights, the Heavenly Worthy sealed the celestial radiance, causing the light to cease shining. A pyre was raised upon high ground, some two hundred *zhang* in height. The Heavenly Worthy sat atop the pyre and set himself ablaze. The fire’s glow illuminated the Four Directions, brightly illuminating all lands.\n\nFrom afar, men and women saw the Heavenly Worthy seated in the flames, yet had no means to approach and lay bare their hearts. The Heavenly Worthy, desiring to observe their resolve, addressed those who had come: \"If you seek long life, enter the fire and receive the Dharma from me.\" Among those who yearned for the Great Dharma with sincere devotion, seventy-two thousand four hundred and fifty persons cast themselves into the flames, all reaching the presence of the Dao. The Heavenly Worthy then conferred upon them the scriptural teachings within the fire, bestowing the Dharma as they entered. All attained deliverance and departed, their forms concealed.\n\nThe remaining four hundred thousand, seeing those who entered did not emerge, believed them to have perished in the flames. Thus, they withdrew and returned to their homelands. Those who had entered the fire to receive deliverance had already returned to their homes by the time the others arrived. Upon meeting again, they were filled with remorse and lamentation, their regret too late to amend. Those who had received deliverance gained long life, their bodies free from suffering, their forms unaging, living for thirty thousand years before passing away. Even those who, though not yet delivered, cultivated the Dharma with diligent devotion, all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: \"In the Dragon Han era, I was the Eternal Lord of Formless Existence, manifesting to teach and transform. At that time, heaven and earth existed, the sun and moon shone with radiance, and the Three Luminaries were complete. There were men and women, birth and death, and though yin and yang were present, there were no rites or canons, nor the five flavors or garments—all arose in primordial chaos. Through the Dao’s transformative instruction, they gradually awakened, coming to know and practice benevolence and righteousness, turning their hearts in faith and devotion. Thus, their lifespans were all extended. Those who did not believe in the Dharma had brief lives.\n\nAfter my departure, heaven and earth collapsed, plunging into vast obscurity. For countless eons, there was no light; above, no celestial hues remained, and below, no abysses endured. Wind and marsh pervaded the void, dark and dim, formless and shadowless, boundless and infinite. This chaotic, timeless state was called the Era of Prolonged Stability. When the Crimson Radiance dawned, heaven and earth were restored, yin and yang emerged, and people were complete, yet birth and death remained.\n\nI manifested again, known as the Nameless Lord, teaching with the Lingbao scriptures to deliver the heavens and humanity. At that time, men and women who cultivated the Dharma with sincere devotion, upholding the scriptures and precepts without negligence, all attained the true Dao, their bones and flesh ascending together, moving freely through the void. Even those who had not yet attained the Dao enjoyed long life, ascending to heavenly realms upon death, reborn in successive lives, their wheel of existence unbroken, eventually attaining immortality.\n\nAfter my departure, at the close of one kalpa, heaven and earth were again destroyed, plunging into darkness. For five kalpas, all was dim and obscure, the Three Qi intermingled in chaos, borne by the turning of the cosmic wheel. When the Kaihuang era arrived, the true scriptures of Lingbao opened the Three Luminaries, heaven and earth were restored, the Five Scriptures shone brilliantly, and the sun, moon, and stars gleamed anew. The four seasons and five phases arose with yin and yang.\n\nI then manifested in the Azure Heaven as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, spreading the Dharma’s teaching and perfecting all heavens. People then were simple and unadorned, conducting their affairs by knotted cords. There were no rites or canons, no five flavors, no clothing, no five colors, no patterns or texts. They dwelled naked in the open, mingling with birds and beasts. Through the Dao’s transformative instruction, their minds gradually awakened, coming to know benevolence and righteousness. Ritual and music flourished, they covered their bodies and partook of flavors, integrating the five phases. Thus, I proclaimed the teaching, propagating the Dharma’s resonance, widely bestowing scriptures, exhorting and admonishing the ignorant, guiding them to turn their hearts in faith and gradually enter the Dharma-gate.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy journeyed to the banks of the Western River and sat upon the Weak Waters. From his mouth issued a five-colored radiance, universally illuminating all heavens and the lands of the Four Directions, so that all beheld the light. The Heavenly Worthy divided his form into a million, appearing simultaneously in every place. Men and women everywhere saw the Heavenly Worthy within the five-colored light, as if present in one location. Wherever he manifested, young and old, men and women, all came to bow in reverence. The Heavenly Worthy, adapting to each land, emitted from his mouth the five true scriptures of Lingbao, their luminous splendor too dazzling to behold. He expounded the Ten Wondrous Scriptures and conferred prohibitive precepts.\n\nHe proclaimed to the men and women: \"If any desire long life, come forth to inscribe your names, etching them upon iron tablets with cinnabar, swearing oaths in blood from bitten arms, pledging sincere devotion before receiving the Dharma and departing.\" At that time, men and women, young and old, from the Four Directions and borderlands, all turned their hearts in devotion. Each brought gold, silver, brocade, and multicolored silks, pearls, jade, and treasures beyond count, coming before the Heavenly Worthy. They prostrated themselves to receive the Dharma and precepts, reverently upholding the wondrous scriptures. For seven days and seven nights, the radiant light shone brightly, and the Four Directions returned to normal. The treasures and pledges of all lands filled the realm.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Worthy then bestowed alms upon the destitute, filling the hungry and sustaining the rich, equalizing wealth and poverty so that none harbored resentment. The heavens reviewed the records, and those whose names were inscribed in the ledgers of good deeds were all delivered across the world, soaring through the great void. Those who first entered the Dharma gate all attained longevity of thirty-six thousand years.\n\nBy the first year of the Supreme August Era, the forms of the celestial men and women reverted to pure simplicity, yet their hearts gradually grew lax and corrupt. Fearing their decline and the incompleteness of the true teaching, I thus manifested in every land to fulfill all hearts. After my passing, within half a kalpa, the men and women of future generations will see their hearts corrupted, growing mutually suspicious and divided. They will disbelieve the scriptural teachings, giving rise to jealousy and harm, competing for supremacy, and attacking one another. Their words will contradict their hearts; they will create their own laws, disrespecting heaven and earth, scorning the divine, killing living beings, and making licentious sacrifices to seek perverse spirits. Men and women will curse one another, indulging in lust and wantonness, stealing without cause. Unwilling to accept their past lives, they will bring harm upon themselves, entering evil destinies and treading paths of suffering. Their lifespans will be short, and they will be afflicted by sorrow, revolving endlessly through the Three Paths and Five Realms. Born only to die, their karmic retribution will follow them, their flesh and blood parted—truly a grievous fate.\n\nNow I expound this scripture to deliver those of future generations who can be delivered. Those of good heart, listen clearly and remember my words well.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord bowed his head in reverence and received the command.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: I have surveyed all the heavens, from kalpas past to this day. The lofty sages and great divine spirits who attained the Dao in the heavens above, along with all the perfected ones and flying immortals of the Three Clarities, Nine Palaces, and Five Peaks, have all received deliverance through the *Lingbao* scriptures, thereby becoming true immortals. Next, I observed the Vermilion Palace of the Southern Mound and the Ninefold Numinous Blessing Hall, where the celestial provisions of past-life blessings nourish the souls of the naturally fed. None among them had not, in their past lives, made offerings to the *Lingbao*, practiced fasting and precepts, awakened the mind of spontaneity, and performed meritorious deeds, thereby attaining deliverance and ascending to the Blessing Hall to receive the celestial provisions.\n\nThis scripture is most venerable and wondrous, delivering countless beings. When great kalpas cycle and the heavens collapse, the earth sinks, the four seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve, and the myriad Daoist arts perish—yet this scripture alone endures, its Dharma unbroken. All other miscellaneous arts—methods of guiding and nourishing life, techniques of transformation, medical formulas, and scattered worldly practices—belong to the Six Heavens and the Desire Realm. When a minor kalpa arrives, all such arts vanish without remnant.\n\nAs for the miscellaneous talismans and diagrams of the Great Clarity, the *Scriptures of the Great Peace*, and various minor Daoist arts and scriptures, they circulate among the eighteen heavens above and below within the Form Realm. When the great kalpa turns, heaven and earth transform, and these texts too will perish without remnant.\n\nThe supreme scriptures of the Jade Clarity—*Three Caverns Divine Scriptures*, *Divine Perfected Tiger Scripts*, *Golden Writings and Jade Characters*, and *Lingbao True Scriptures*—all emanate from the Primordial Beginning, residing above the twenty-eight heavens in the formless realm. When the great kalpa cycles, these texts return to the Seven Jeweled Mystic Terrace of Jade Capital Mountain in the Supreme Primordial Great Luo Heaven, untouched by calamity. The Great Luo Heaven is the highest of the fifty-five myriad, five thousand, five hundred, and fifty-five heavens.\n\nThus, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, *Mystic Mystery of the Lingbao*, *Cavernous Void*, and *Cavernous Nonbeing*—the spontaneous texts—perish and arise with the cosmic cycles, encompassing all scriptures and serving as the foundation of all heavens. Those who cultivate them diligently attain divine transcendence, eternal life, and deliverance across the world, ascending in broad daylight to soar through the void. Those who uphold them with reverence and devotion will see their seven ancestors reborn in heaven, becoming wheel-turning sage kings, their blessings unbroken through generations, bound to good karmic conditions.\n\n**Numinous Writings of the Heavens: Chapters on Delivering Lives**\n\n**Chapter on the Numinous Writings of the Nine Qi Heavens of the East for Delivering Lives**\nIn the Eastern Palace of Radiance, the perfected ones and jade maidens chant its verses to harmonize form and soul, record qi to preserve life, retain spirit to attain transcendence—these are the subtle words of the Primordial Beginning’s spontaneity.\n\nThe Eastern Radiance exhales numinous winds,\nThe Western Palace harmonizes with jade sounds.\nThe two qi conjoin in the empty cavern,\nFrom the Great Void, the heart arises.\nThe Numinous Writings unfurl like long branches,\nThe Treasure Scripts flourish in emerald forests.\nPhoenix songs echo through the heavens,\nChanted in rhythm with the six hours.\nAbove stands the Youth Who Delivers Lives,\nDispelling night and illuminating the long darkness.\nFor ten thousand kalpas, he preserves the brightness of form,\nYet remains too subtle to trace.\nHe records the undying years,\nFloating and sinking with the cosmic cycles.\nSun and moon illuminate the numinous soul,\nThe celestial pivot turns to the southeast.\nThe nine stars cast their shadows,\nTreasure blossoms bloom in the five hearts.\nThere exists an undecaying spirit,\nSealed with me in cinnabar and gold.\nThe Red Writings tally the essence of qi,\nThe Jade Instructions hold profound mystery.\nIn the Vermilion Palace lie the records,\nNo demon or spirit can invade.\nThis chapter originates from the Primordial Beginning’s Eastern Radiance Azure Palace, sealed by the Great Lord Azure Youth in a treasure casket of azure jade, stamped with the Primordial Beginning’s Nine Qi Seal, and guarded by nine jade maidens of the azure waist. Those who recite it harmonize form and soul, stabilize life and retain spirit, with the Eight Effulgences as their guardians, ensuring their bodies endure forever. Their seven ancestors rejoice together, all entering the gate of blessings.\n\n**Jade Chapter on the Numinous Writings of the Three Qi Vermilion Heavens of the South for Delivering Lives**\nIn the Upper Palace of the Vermilion Mound, the perfected ones and jade maidens constantly chant these verses to secure the mud-pill palace, nourish the brain and cultivate spirit, preserve life and retain qi—this is the spontaneous chapter.\n\nCrimson clouds and emerald jade void,\nNuminous winds brush the Great Subtlety.\nVast and distant, the six qi disperse,\nSubtle and faint, they exhale numinous radiance.",

The four heavens’ sagely perfected ones and jade maidens constantly chant them to retain spirit and stabilize qi, harmonizing form and soul. Their elegant sounds are wondrous and peerless, their wisdom penetrating the empty void. Thus, when the upright gentlemen of the four directions obtain these dharma sounds, they spontaneously attain the Dao and the real, their lifespans become long and far-reaching.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous, the most venerable among all scriptures, a gateway of the Great Vehicle for nurturing life and protecting the dead.\n\nIf in future lives, the hearts of men and women turn against their destiny, not being as pure and sincere as in this life, constantly harboring doubt and jealousy toward those surpassing them, contending for merit and fame, mutually attacking and harming, self-injuring their years and fate, not speaking of their own evil and perverse deeds, but instead claiming the scriptural teachings lack numinous efficacy—after I depart, the scriptures and Dao will return to the Great Veil Heaven above the Three Realms. Gazing from afar at their hearts, among them there will surely be those who can be delivered. You must diligently propagate and transform, enabling those with the heart to hear the Dharma, delivering them from the roots of suffering and affliction, so their bodies behold the light and encounter good karmic conditions. Those who do not believe and turn toward it bring upon themselves the path of fire and ashes, drifting and trailing through the Five Paths of birth and death, with no time of liberation. How earnestly I exhort you, thus repeatedly admonishing, unable to bear seeing future generations’ obstinate folly and pitiful state. Therefore, I leave this luminous warning: be diligent in practice and do not slacken.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, the Utmost Real Venerable Spirits, all bow their heads in reverence, receive the command, and depart.\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Writings of the Heavens for Delivering Lives from the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure* concludes.",
