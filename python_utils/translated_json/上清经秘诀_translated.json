Thus, teachings unfold gradually or suddenly, for people vary in wisdom. Methods are adapted to their capacities, but the essential aim is to unite with the Dao.\n\nPrecepts serve to prevent wrongdoing and restrain evil, cutting off the six emotions. Those who receive the registers advance in rank and ascend as immortals, transcending the Three Realms.\n\nAs the *Chapter on Dao-Nature* states:\n*\"Precepts and practices gather sentient beings,\nRecording and guiding them to the True One.\"*\n\nFrom shallow exploration to profound inquiry, there are degrees of excellence. From mortality to sagehood, each progresses in stages.\n\nThe initial precepts begin with the Orthodox Unity and the Immortal Spirits, culminating in the Jade Clarity and Ascension to the Mysterious Register. Through penetrating the mysterious and uniting with the Dao, one aligns with true words and images, venerating the Dao, following its masters, practicing its teachings, and observing its rites.\n\nWe have heard that in the vast expanse, the True Lord abides. At the inception of primordial chaos, the sages perceived its benefits. Their teachings bestow goodness without possession; their Dao is daily renewed in use. Thus, the radiant cloud-scriptures of the immortals are concealed within jade tablets and sacred scrolls. Only those who hold the charts and receive the registers may practice their teachings; only those who dwell in truth and select the worthy may access their texts.\n\nThe clarification of truth comprises five disciplines. The Most High left the Ten Precepts. Our imperial house, blessed with the accumulated virtues of white clouds, inherits the wondrous principles of the Mysterious Origin. Harmonizing virtue with the Two Modes and shining together with the Five Sages, it nurtures all beings with the Perfect Dao and governs the multitudes with profound virtue.\n\nThe *Scriptures of Supreme Clarity* state:\nThe Three Caverns are:\n1. The Cavern of Reality,\n2. The Cavern of Mystery,\n3. The Cavern of Divinity.\nEach has twelve gates, dividing into thirty-six revered scriptures, corresponding above to the Three Clarities and thirty-six heavens, and below to the nine tiers and thirty-six palaces and bureaus.\n\nThus, the human head contains nine palaces, the heart nine apertures, the navel nine spirits, and the body nine portals—thirty-six in total.\n\nThe *Scripture on the Generation of Deities in the Nine Heavens* states:\nWhen a person is conceived in the womb, the Three Primes nurture and cultivate them. The nine *qi* coalesce into form, and in the ninth month, the spirits are arrayed. When the *qi* is full, the voice emerges, and the body and spirits are complete. The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Great One holds the talisman, the Thearchs confer ranks, the Registrar records the name, the Director of Destinies fixes the lifespan, the Five Emperors oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, and the deities of heaven and earth, along with the Three Realms, all attend—such is not a trifling matter.\n\nThe *Concealed Instructions on Ascending to Reality* states:\nWhat is discussed as the One Principle is the pure and luminous Dao-nature within all sentient beings. The Dao-nature is neither existent nor non-existent; the true nature is eternally present. Thus, when it is communicated, it is called the Dao. The Dao exists yet is formless; when it takes form, it possesses sentience. Its transformations are unfathomable, pervading all beings. Within the human body, it becomes spirit and illumination, which is the heart. Therefore, teaching people to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao; teaching people to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart.\n\nThe Dao cannot be seen; it is revealed through life. Life cannot be eternal; it is preserved through the Dao. When life perishes, the Dao is abandoned; when united with the Dao, one attains longevity.\n\n**Here ends *The Esoteric Scriptures of Supreme Clarity*.**",
