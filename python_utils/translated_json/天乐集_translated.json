Daoist Lineages**\nThe learning of the Daoist school, also called the Mysterious Learning, is the most ancient in China. Formerly, Duke Ai asked Zixia: “Did the Five Emperors have teachers?” Zixia replied: “Your servant has heard that the Yellow Emperor studied under Da Fen, Zhuanxu under Lu Tu, Ku under Chi Chengzi, Yao under Wu Chengzi, Shun under Yin Shou, Yu under the Queen Mother of the West, Tang under Cheng Bozi, King Wen under Xi Chouzi, King Wu under the Grand Duke, the Duke of Zhou under Guo Shu, and Confucius under Lao Dan. Without encountering these teachers, these eleven sages could not have established their achievements in the world or transmitted their names to later generations.”\n\nI note: Most of the eleven sages mentioned were ancient immortals. Ancient immortals manifesting in the world were too numerous to count. Among those who wrote books and established doctrines, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are foremost; today, Laozi is universally honored as the founding ancestor of the Dao. This is because Laozi composed the *Daodejing*, which expounded the profound mysteries of the Daoist school and became the model for later generations.\n\nLaozi transmitted his teachings to Chen Xiyi (Chen Tuan), Xiyi to the True Man of Fire Dragon, Fire Dragon to Zhang Sanfeng, and Sanfeng to Shen Wansan, Qiu Yuanjing, Master Li, and Wang Yuantong, among many other disciples. This lineage is known as the Wenshi (Literary Beginnings) School, also called the Hidden Immortals School.\n\n**II.**\nSecond, Laozi transmitted his teachings to Wang Xuanyu, styled Donghua, also called Shaoyang. Shaoyang transmitted to Zhongli Quan, known as Zhengyang. Zhengyang transmitted to Lü Yan, known as Chunyang. From Master Lü’s disciples emerged four branches:\n\n1. Lüzu transmitted to Yan Xiang Liu Haichan, and Haichan to Zhang Ziyang. Ziyang founded the Southern School.\n2. Lüzu transmitted to Wang Chongyang of the Southern Song, who established the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) Teaching and founded the Northern School.\n3. During the Jiajing reign of the Ming, Lüzu transmitted to Lu Xixing of Huaihai, styled Qianxu, founding the Eastern School.\n4. During the Daoguang reign of the Qing, Lüzu transmitted to Li Xiyue of Jiading, Sichuan, styled Hanxu, founding the Great River Western School.\n\nThis lineage is known as the Donghua School, also called the Shaoyang School.\n\nIn the Southern School, Ziyang transmitted to Shi Xinglin, Xinglin to Xue Zixian, Xue to Chen Niuwan, and Chen to Bai Ziqing. From Zhang to Bai, there were five transmissions, collectively known as the “Five Southern Patriarchs.” Ziqing transmitted to Peng Helin, Peng to Xiao Zixu, and thereafter the lamp of transmission was passed to many, all direct lineages of the Southern School.\n\nChongyang, a native of Xianyang, was of the Northern School. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song, he wandered to Mount Zhongnan, where he encountered the two patriarchs Zhong and Lü and cultivated the Dao in seclusion. Emerging from the pass, he established the Quanzhen Teaching and initiated Ma Danyang, Sun Bu’er, Qiu Chuji, Liu Chuxuan, Tan Chuduan, Wang Chuyi, and Hao Datong, who attained the Dao in succession. These seven are known as the “Seven Northern Perfected.”\n\nAmong the Seven Northern Perfected, the most far-reaching in their transmission of the teachings were Patriarch Ma and Patriarch Qiu. Those such as Song Piyun, Li Qizhen, Zhang Ziqiong, Zhao Yuandu, Chen Zhixu, and Zhang Tianyu were all descendants of Danyang’s lineage. Those such as the True Man Zhang of Tiger Skin Seat, Li Xu’an, Cao Huanyang, and Wu Chongxu were all descendants of Chuji’s lineage.\n\nThe Quanzhen Teaching flourished in the north. Reading Jin Xueshi Yuan’s *Record of the Purple Tenuity Abbey* (*Yishan Collection: Record of the Purple Tenuity Abbey*) provides an overview: “Since the Zhenyuan and Zhenglong eras, there has been the teaching of the Quanzhen School. Wang Zhongfu (i.e., Chongyang) of Xianyang initiated it, and Tan, Ma, Qiu, Liu, and others followed. It was based on the teachings of profound tranquility, without the absurdities of yellow-capped priests’ exorcisms, and incorporated the teachings of Chan meditation without the hardships of ascetic bondage. They tilled fields and dug wells, sustaining themselves, and extended their surplus to others. Compared to the tumult of the world, they seemed to live with ease. Thus, the indolent and indigent flocked to them. From the Huai River in the south to the deserts in the north, from Qin in the west to the sea in the east, mountain forests, cities, and dwellings stood in sight of one another, with groups of ten or a hundred. After the chaos of the Zhenyou and Xiang eras, when all standards of order and culture had collapsed, the restless people had nowhere to turn. The only teaching available was this one school. From this, one can see the flourishing of the Quanzhen Teaching and the immense benefit it brought to sentient beings—far beyond those who cultivate in seclusion in deep mountains, merely perfecting themselves.”\n\nThe lineage of the Eastern School has no surviving texts for reference. As for the Western School, Patriarch Li transmitted to Wu Tianzhi of Shaanxi, and Grand Preceptor Wu transmitted to Ke Baozhen of Hubei and my teacher, Master Wang Tizhen. From the founding ancestor to my teacher, six transmissions have spanned over two thousand years—a truly long span. This is the general succession of the Donghua and Wenshi lineages.\n\nFurther examination of *Marvelous Encounters in Mountains and Seas* reveals that Lüzu and Liu Haichan once transmitted the elixir formulas to Chen Xiyi, and the True Man Zhang Sanfeng also transmitted elixir formulas to Li Hanxu. Thus, from the Five Dynasties onward, the lineages of the Wenshi and Donghua schools have in fact merged, a convergence brought about by the times and conditions.\n\nThe emergence of the Northern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Schools under Lüzu’s disciples was due to regional divisions, not differences in true formulas or cultivation and verification. Investigating further, Ziyang opened his teachings on Mount Tiantai, thereby becoming the founding ancestor of the Southern School.\n\nWang Chongyang propagated the teachings in the northern regions, thus becoming the patriarch of the Northern School. Xixing was born in Huaihai, and Xiyue in southern Sichuan, thereby becoming the founding ancestors of the Eastern and Western Schools respectively.\n\nMaster Wang observed: \"The Southern and Northern Schools both originated from the transmission of the two patriarchs, Zhongli and Lü. If one distinguishes them by geography, it is acceptable; but if one divides them by the Great Dao, such reasoning is unsound.\" This may be called an immutable truth.\n\nII. The Origins of the Dao\n\nFu Xi drew the trigrams, revealing the secrets of creation; Nüwa mended the heavens, disclosing the marvel of \"taking from Kan to fill Li,\" yet these were but images without written records. As for the teachings of self-cultivation, those set down in writing began with the words of Guangcheng to the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Renyou\" chapter states: \"When the Yellow Emperor had been on the throne for nineteen years, his decrees were implemented throughout the world. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelt on Mount Kongtong, he went to visit him, saying, 'I have heard that you, Master, have attained the Perfect Dao. May I venture to ask about the essence of the Perfect Dao? I wish to draw upon the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to ensure the flourishing of all living things. How may this be done?'\n\n\"Guangchengzi replied, 'What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to regulate is the dregs of things. Ever since you began governing the world, clouds have rained before gathering, plants and trees have withered before turning yellow, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. With the sly and flattering heart you possess, how could you be fit to speak of the Perfect Dao?'\n\n\"The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white couch grass, and dwelt in seclusion for three months before returning to seek an audience. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from the lower side, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked, 'I have heard that you, Master, have attained the Perfect Dao. May I venture to ask how to cultivate the body so as to attain longevity?'\n\n\"Guangchengzi rose abruptly and said, 'Excellent question! Come, and I will tell you the Perfect Dao. The essence of the Perfect Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, hold fast to the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary the body, do not agitate the essence—then you may attain long life. Let the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the mind know nothing, and the spirit will guard the body, and the body will attain long life. Guard your inner self, close off your outer senses; much knowledge brings ruin. I will lead you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I will guide you into the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang have their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated myself for one thousand two hundred years, and my body has never declined.'\n\n\"The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and said, 'Guangchengzi is truly heaven itself!'\n\n\"Guangchengzi said, 'Come, and I will tell you. That which is boundless, yet men all deem finite; that which is unfathomable, yet men all deem limited.'\"\n\n\"Those who attain my Dao shall ascend as emperors and descend as kings; those who lose my Dao shall rise as mere light and sink into dust. Now, all the myriad beings are born from earth and return to earth—thus I shall leave you, enter the Gate of the Boundless, and wander the Wilds of the Infinite.\n\nI share radiance with the sun and moon, I endure with heaven and earth—am I near? Am I far? All men shall perish, yet shall I alone endure?\"\n\nThis is the essential principle of Daoist life-nurturing, the mysterious pivot of longevity and enduring vision. The most crucial passage lies in the four characters *\"guard the One and abide in harmony\"*—the practice of mind and breath interdependent.\n\nThe study of the Golden Elixir traces its origins here. When the adept unites mind and breath, spirit and qi merge, yin and yang harmonize; in stillness, one enters profound obscurity—this is the *Kun* storehouse, the utmost yin. Yet once I return to pure *Kun*, the pure *Qian* within the void must respond and come, meeting in a fleeting encounter where timing and spirit converge. As the alchemical texts say: *\"After lead arises in gui, a single yang returns\"*—this is the utmost yang, the Great Brightness.\n\n*\"Yin and yang have their storehouses\"* refers to concealing mind and breath within the Mysterious Orifice. *\"Embrace spirit in stillness\"* means that as spirit and breath interdepend, one gradually enters quiescent concentration. *\"Dim and silent\"* describes the state of prolonged dependence entering into emptiness, the realm of primordial chaos.\n\n*\"Guard the One\"* means preserving this true primordial qi to congeal the Dao-embryo. *\"Abide in harmony\"* describes the equilibrium of water and fire, the perfect harmony of true qi, where the entire body becomes supple, blissful, and intoxicated.\n\nIn elixir practice, as I become empty and still, I attract the true qi of yang from *Qian*; through daily and monthly accumulation, it coagulates into the Elixir. Ultimately, the boundless primordial qi of heaven and earth nurtures both my physical and dharmic bodies. Over time, qi transforms, and the form becomes immortal.\n\nIn this state, there is no labor, no movement, no seeing, no hearing, no knowing—all are essential principles for nurturing spirit and settling breath. Only when spirit is settled does qi return; only when qi returns does the Elixir form. Thus, nurturing spirit is the first step in mysterious cultivation, the precursor to reversion.\n\nIf spirit is unsettled, the Dao cannot bear it. The terms *\"enter,\"* *\"lead,\"* *\"conceal,\"* and *\"guard\"* all reveal the subtleties of the firing process, which ultimately converge in *\"abiding in harmony.\"*\n\n*\"Enter the Gate of the Boundless\"* and *\"wander the Wilds of the Infinite\"*—uniting with the constant virtue of heaven and earth—depicts the image of Great Quiescence and True Emptiness. *\"Things will naturally flourish,\"* *\"that which is boundless,\"* and *\"that which is unfathomable\"* all point to the profound subtleties of the medicinal substances.\n\nThese three instances of *\"thing\"* refer to the *\"One\"* in *\"guard the One\"*—namely, the primordial true *yi* qi. Preserve it in stillness, gather it in movement; through long accumulation, body and mind both transform, form and spirit both become wondrous, and the Dao gathers within me. All men perish, yet I alone endure.\n\nThough brief, this wondrous passage encompasses the medicinal substances, firing process, true earth, gathering, and warming nurturance—all the principles of longevity and enduring vision. As Lu Xixing of the Ming Dynasty wrote in *The Nanhua Secondary Ink*: *\"Reading a thousand volumes of alchemical texts is not as good as studying a single passage from 'In the Realm of Yu.'\"* Truly, he was a connoisseur of the Dao.\n\nSome say Guangchengzi was an emanation of the Dao Ancestor. Yet this interpretation remains superficial. When the Yellow Emperor ascended Kongtong and met Guangcheng, it was the Yellow Emperor himself who had attained Great Quiescence and True Emptiness, thereby perceiving his own dharmic body. The dharmic nature is vast and boundless; the three realms of existence (the realm of proper vessels, the realm of sentient beings, and the realm of correct awakening) are established upon it—hence the name *Guangcheng* (Vast Completion).\n\nThis original self-nature is inherent in all, yet due to deluded thoughts, attachments, and defilements of discriminative views, one cannot realize it. If one attains emptiness of dharmas and exhausts the defilements of consciousness, the true suchness of dharmic nature will naturally manifest—luminous and all-pervading, like the sun emerging from behind clouds.\n\nThis is the esoteric meaning behind the Yellow Emperor’s ascent of Kongtong to meet Guangcheng. As *The Song of Realizing the Dao* by Yongjia says:\n*\"The mind-mirror shines, reflecting without obstruction,\nVast and clear, it illumines the ten directions.\nThe myriad forms and shadows appear within,\nA single orb of radiance, neither inside nor out.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"The wondrous awakened radiance shines through inner and outer,\nEnveloping the six directions, without near or far.\"*\nMaster Miaozheng said: *\"Mind and Buddha are equal to emptiness,\nThe wonders within emptiness are unfathomable.\nThe azure sea’s light holds myriad rays,\nThe green mountains’ hues stand tall with a thousand peaks.\nCease groping, do not exert effort,\nFormless and imageless, all traces vanish.\nThe true suchness of wondrous form is originally formless,\nThe six penetrations and wisdom are not true penetrations.\nWhere dust arises, things manifest,\nWhere realms recede, minds become empty.\nRecognize the single pearl of mani,\nAnd the light of the Ganges’ sands shines eternally.\"*\n\nIs this not the dharmic image of Guangcheng?\n\nThus, the Daoist Guangchengzi is the Tathāgatagarbha of Buddhism, the true mark without marks and the wondrous mind of Nirvana in Chan, the One True Dharmadhātu of the Huayan school. Those who perceive it not only ascend as immortals and attain longevity (as the *Nirvana Sutra* calls *\"eternal abiding\"*), but as the Yellow Emperor, who met Guangcheng, naturally attained the Dao and became a perfected being.\n\nThe teachings of the Dao—caution within, closure without, guarding the One and abiding in harmony, preserving essence and nurturing spirit, merging form with the Dao—are the Yellow Emperor’s embodiment of the teaching, inaugurating the lineage of China’s mysterious tradition.\n\n*The Book of Liezi* records four passages of the Yellow Emperor’s teachings on the Dao.\n\nThe first passage states: *\"When form moves, it does not move—yet from it arises shadow. When sound moves, it does not move—yet from it arises echo. Without movement, nothing is born; from nothingness, being arises. Form must perish—do heaven and earth also perish? They perish with me.\"* The essential meaning here lies in the cycle of arising and ceasing, all rooted in movement. To reverse the flow of birth and death, one must attain non-movement. For movement departs from the root, while stillness returns to it. The phrase *\"Without movement, nothing is born\"* strikes to the very core. If a Dao practitioner reaches the state of a mind without movement, they transform arising-and-ceasing into quiescent extinction, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death is assured.\n\nThe second passage states: *\"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly it endures, its use never exhausted.\"* This chapter secretly reveals the *\"outer Mysterious Pass.\"* The principle of mind and breath interdependent, neither forgotten nor forced, is the sole path of ascent in the Mystery School, the guiding principle for returning the breath to the origin. Master Hanxu said: *\"The Valley Spirit is the original nature. The valley symbolizes emptiness; the spirit, numinosity. When the nature-body is empty and numinous, it is not obscured. Not obscured means it does not die. Yet why is the Valley Spirit also called the Mysterious Female? The Mysterious is heaven; the Female, earth. When heaven and earth unite, the Mysterious Female is formed—within it, emptiness and vastness.\"* The sage in cultivating the body borrows this empty and vast Mysterious Female to nurture the empty and numinous Valley Spirit, hence naming the Mysterious Female after the Valley Spirit—this is the meaning of naming by function. Yin and yang course within it; Kan and Li unite within it. The harmony of heaven and earth is nothing beyond this. Thus it is also called the root of heaven and earth, meaning the root wherein heaven and earth mutually reside. The root of heaven and earth is the place of returning to the origin and reverting to the primordial, the realm of refining qi and transmuting spirit. *\"Subtly it endures\"* refers to nurturing the Valley Spirit, naturally attaining fetal breathing. *\"Its use never exhausted\"* refers to the external furnace’s waxing and waning, naturally aligning with the fire. *\"Never exhausted\"* means without labor. The formula states: *\"Concentrate the spirit in emptiness, follow the breath’s natural flow, abide in spontaneity, subtly it endures.\"* This is the marvel of *\"never exhausted.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Float and wander, guarding the center of the compass\"*—this is the same formula.\n\nThe third passage states: *\"When spirit and essence enter its gate, the bones and frame return to their root—what then remains of me?\"* This chapter reveals the dual stabilization of spirit and breath, the merging of being into non-being, the return to the fundamental root, the dissolution of both root and realm, and the attainment of the marvel of self-emptiness. As the *Lankavatara Sutra* says: *\"When the notion of a personal self is absent, one approaches this.\"* Yang Renshan said: *\"Ultimately, it reveals my true self.\"* The gate is the gateway of the Mysterious Female. The root is the root of heaven and earth. Like bubbles dissolving into the sea, if one seeks the form of the self, it is utterly unattainable. The culmination of this chapter lies in the phrase *\"what then remains of me?\"* Those who oppose the Dao are harmed by the grasping of self. The formula states: *\"Mind and breath interdependent, until external breath is entirely cut off, one abides in great serenity. With prolonged stabilization, one enters quiescence, forgets form and image, wondrously merges with true emptiness. Even if yang arises, it is as if unnoticed—this may be called 'what then remains of me?'\"*\"Enter\"* and *\"return\"* both reveal the marvel of reversing the flow to transcend birth and death. This *\"gateway of the Mysterious Female\"* was called by the ancients the *\"Gate of Life and Door of Death.\"* If spirit and essence exit its gate, one follows the flow and dies; if they enter its gate, one reverses the flow and lives. Exiting leads to dispersion, entering to gathering; exiting to annihilation, entering to preservation. Thus it is said: *\"The Door of Death and Gate of Life take this aperture as their foundation.\"* This chapter of the Yellow Emperor reveals the principle of *\"revolving the primordial and returning to the origin\"*—what the Old Master called *\"returning to the root and recovering the mandate.\"* The previous chapter revealed *\"regulating the breath and nurturing the spirit,\"* while this chapter reveals *\"form and spirit returning to emptiness\"* and entering the realm of the Great Void. The latter is deeper than the former, yet the practice is originally one continuous progression. If one can put these two chapters into practice, the path of return is already open.\n\nThe fourth passage concerns the Yellow Emperor’s spirit-journey to Huaxu. The *Liezi·Huangdi* states: *\"Thereupon, he set aside the myriad affairs, left his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells and chimes, reduced his meals, and retired to dwell in leisure in the Hall of the Great Court. Purifying his mind and disciplining his form, for three months he did not attend to government matters. One day, he lay down and dreamed of traveling to the land of Huaxu. The land of the Huaxu clan lay west of Yanzhou and north of Taizhou, countless thousands of miles beyond this state of Qi. It was a place beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot—accessible only by spirit-journey. In that land, there were no rulers or leaders—all was spontaneous.\"*\n\nIts people knew no cravings or desires—all was spontaneous. Unaware of delight in life, unaware of aversion to death, thus they knew no premature demise. Unaware of closeness to self, unaware of distance from things, thus they knew no love or hatred. Unaware of opposition, unaware of compliance, thus they knew no profit or harm. Entirely without attachment, entirely without fear or taboo, they entered water yet did not drown, entered fire yet felt no heat, endured blows without pain, suffered scratches without itch. Treading the void as though it were solid ground, resting in emptiness as though upon a bed, clouds and mist did not obstruct their sight, thunder and lightning did not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness did not unsettle their minds, mountains and valleys did not trip their steps—all was spirit-travel alone.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor awoke, he was joyful and content. Summoning Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan, he reported to them: “For three months I dwelt in leisure, purifying my mind and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao of nurturing the body and ordering things. Yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know: the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have attained it, yet cannot convey it to you.”\n\nThis passage, too, is allegory. The land of the Huaxu clan is the realm of the formless and soundless, the realm of great stillness. By relinquishing the myriad entanglements, forgetting both body and mind, stilling both emotion and perception, the Yellow Emperor suddenly awakened to the Dao of true constancy. This effortless operation is the most transcendent and free.\n\nThe saying “the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion” is an unchanging truth for all ages. Master Zao Bochang observed: “In the present, one is mortal; when emotion is forgotten, one becomes immortal.” Thus, forgetting emotion and stilling perception is the essential task in learning the Dao.\n\nAfter the Yellow Emperor, those who wrote books to elucidate Daoist teachings must first honor the Old Sage. The *Daodejing* begins with the two characters “being” and “non-being.” As it states: *“Abide in constant non-desire to observe its mysteries; abide in constant desire to observe its manifestations.”* These two lines, in terms of practice, describe the interdependence of mind and breath. What is called “the gate of all mysteries” is the Mysterious Pass. Where it says: *“Vague and indistinct, yet within it are images, within it are things, within it are essences, within it is sincerity,”* this refers to the gathering of primordial qi. Where it says: *“Can you embrace the One and not depart from it? Can you concentrate your qi and attain suppleness like a newborn babe? Can you open and close the Gate of Heaven without partiality?”* all point to the principles of regulating the breath. Where it says: *“Empty your mind, fill your belly,”* this is refining the self and laying the foundation. Where it speaks of “nourishing the Mother” and “guarding the Mother,” this refers to gathering and nurturing. Where it says: *“Guard the center and embrace the One,”* this is the long nurturing of the sacred embryo. Where it says: *“Attain emptiness and guard stillness, return to the root and recover life,”* this describes refining the form with jade liquid, the practice of self-cultivation that encompasses all. Where it says: *“A great state flows downstream”* or *“descend and take,”* this reveals the secret of the alchemical reversal of yin and yang, the union of heaven and earth. Where it says: *“Disregard the body,”* *“place the body last,”* this is the essential principle of guarding against danger. Where it says: *“Block the openings,”* *“shut the doors,”* this is the subtle truth of nurturing. Where it says: *“The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible; the empty qi brings harmony,”* this describes the circulation of qi through the celestial orbit. Where it says: *“Good conduct leaves no tracks,”* this describes the circulation of spirit through the celestial orbit. Where it says: *“Return to a state of no-thing,”* *“return to the limitless,”* this is the return to emptiness and union with the Dao.\n\nAlas! The profound meanings of the alchemical classics are fully revealed here.\n\nWhen Laozi was about to enter the Western Regions, Yin Xi encountered him at the pass and asked about the Dao. Laozi said: “Emptiness and indistinctness are the root of the Dao. It gives birth to me from the void, it leads me to non-being. Thus, what gives birth to me is spirit; what brings death to me is the heart. Therefore, the body is the chariot, the dwelling, the master. When the body is tranquil, spirit resides within it; when the body is restless, spirit departs from it. Thus, if one disregards the body and preserves spirit, essence and radiance remain. When virtue and Dao unite, one communicates with the Dao. The good person does not contend with the myriad things, is humble and without desire. Thus, desire is the root of misfortune and harm. Non-being is the origin of heaven and earth. The sage eliminates desire and enters non-being to assist the body. Therefore, when I look, I see nothing of desire; when I listen, I hear nothing of desire; when I speak, I say nothing of desire; when I eat, I taste nothing of desire. Serene and tranquil, thus I am clear and still, non-active, and qi naturally returns to its pre-birth state.\n\nI see that those who love others do not love as much as those who love their own bodies; those who love their own bodies do not love as much as those who love their spirit. Those who love their spirit do not love as much as those who relinquish their spirit; those who relinquish their spirit do not love as much as those who guard their bodies. Those who guard their bodies—this is constancy! Spirit gives birth to form; form completes spirit. Thus, if form does not obtain its spirit, it cannot live of itself; if spirit does not obtain its form, it cannot be completed of itself. When form and spirit unite, they mutually give birth, mutually harmonize and complete—only then is it achieved. The highest filial piety in the world may be called the ability to nurture one’s body. Those who can love their mother—thus their bodies endure long. When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Thus, those who skillfully nurture the body conceal themselves within the body yet do not emerge, conceal others within others yet do not appear. Why? They constantly take emptiness as the body, take non-being as the heart—this is called the body without body, the heart without heart. Thus, guarding spirit and attaining mysterious communication—this is called union with the Dao.”\n\nMy life rests in myself alone, not in Heaven and Earth. If I do not see, do not hear, do not know, then spirit does not leave the body—thus it endures with the Dao. I share a single qi with Heaven and Earth, guarding my own root. Nothing in the world is more yielding than qi, nothing more yielding than the Dao. The Dao’s yielding nature encompasses Heaven and Earth, permeates the myriad things. For the soft can give birth to the hard, the weak can overcome the strong—yet none in the world know whence its root arises.\n\nBeing arises from non-being as its mother, non-being from emptiness as its mother, emptiness from the Dao as its mother—this is the root of the Dao. What is called a Daoist? One whose spirit, though within the body, ensures it never departs. Prosperity is born of decline, yin is born of yang, and so being and non-being give rise to one another, emptiness and fullness complete one another. Thus life returns to being, and non-being returns to non-being.\n\nMan exists within the Dao as a fish exists within water. When the Dao departs, man perishes; when the water dries, the fish dies. Therefore the sage returns to the state before birth—his form concealed, his spirit abiding—so the world turns to him. By non-action and non-affair, the state is full and the people prosper. Preserving the constancy of the Dao is called profound unity.\n\nMan is born by obtaining spirit, yet does not know where spirit resides. Only the sage conceals it within, so that the corporeal soul does not depart. Guard the mother, and the child is preserved—thus the people flourish. The Way of cultivating the body is to penetrate the primordial chaos of primal qi, to resolve and guard one’s own being.\n\nHeaven does not desire clarity, yet clarity returns to it; Earth does not desire turbidity, yet turbidity returns to it. Dampness does not desire water, yet water returns to it; dryness does not desire fire, yet fire returns to it. Emptiness and non-action do not desire the Dao, yet the Dao returns to them. From this we see: what nature of things is not spontaneous?\n\nWhen Laozi had finished expounding the Dao, he again addressed Master Yin: “I tell you the essentials of the supreme Dao: still the heart and guard the One—then all defilements vanish, and all affairs are complete.”\n\nThe subtlety of this teaching lies in concealing spirit and guarding the mother, in emptiness and spontaneity—this is the original teaching of the Daoist school. The opening phrase, “Vague and indistinct, it is the root of the Dao,” subtly instructs that the breath of spirit is settled in external emptiness, guiding it to return to oneness and enter samādhi. Thus the following text says: “It gives me life in emptiness, places me in non-being.” Again: “Exteriorize the spirit, preserve the spirit.” And again: “Though spirit is in the body, ensure it does not remain in the body”—is this not teaching one to “concentrate spirit in emptiness, empty body and heart”?\n\nThus, embracing spirit to nurture nature, and harmonizing with the mean to nurture qi, mother and child remain in mutual affection, nature and life unite—this is the essential Way of cultivating the body. To “nurture the mother,” “love the mother,” “guard the mother” is the teaching of “feeding the mother and guarding the mother” in the *Daodejing*. When body and heart are both settled, wondrously merging with true emptiness, one returns to the state before birth. When form unites with the Dao, concealment and manifestation are at ease—thus we know that emptiness and spontaneity are the fundamental principles of the Great Dao and the path to true attainment.\n\nThe text says: “When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Constantly take emptiness as the body, take non-being as the heart—this is called the body without body, the heart without heart.” And again: “Emptiness and non-action—yet the Dao returns to them.” What better transmission of the essentials of cultivating the profound mystery could there be? This truly may be called the subtle warp of the myriad wonders, the ultimate purport of the five thousand characters.\n\nThe secret formula says:\nSpirit and breath wondrously unite, returning to primordial chaos.\nGuard the center and embrace the One—body and heart are tranquil and still.\nEmpty, still, and serene—this is the dwelling of all sages.\nReturn to the state before birth, and the source of the Dao is seen.\nThe nature of emptiness, the original substance—beyond words and explanation.\nThe great compassion of sages and worthies reveals the essential principles.\nWhen body is empty and heart is still, the Dao naturally returns.\nConstant virtue does not depart, returning to the infinite.\n\n---\n\n**The Three Treasures of Laozi**\n\nThe Old Sage said: “I have three treasures, which I hold and preserve: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. Compassion makes one brave, frugality makes one expansive, not daring to be first in the world makes one the chief of vessels. Now, to abandon compassion yet seek bravery, abandon frugality yet seek expansiveness, abandon the rear yet seek the front—this is death.”\n\nLet us briefly elucidate their meanings:\n\n**Compassion** has two aspects:\nFirst, not harming or disturbing living beings. Thus one should uphold the four fundamental precepts: not killing, not stealing, not deceiving, not engaging in licentiousness.\nSecond, bringing joy to others. Thus one should skillfully benefit beings, aiding them according to conditions—whether through material gifts to provide clothing and food, or through Dharma teaching to nourish wisdom-life. Seeing all beings as one with oneself, one broadly practices skillful means and universally bestows the joy of Dharma. In this way, the wind of compassion and harmony daily increases, the wind of contention and plunder daily diminishes. Abandoning selfishness for merit and profit, exalting the substance of virtue and morality—thus the world may be pacified.\n\nThe Buddha is called “Great Compassion” and also “Great Hero,” for his virtue of compassionately delivering beings is all-pervasive.\n\n**Frugality** also has two aspects:\nFirst, living simply.\nSecond, reducing thoughts and desires. When inner and outer are mutually supported, essence and qi become abundant, and resources do not run dry—thus the people’s virtue may return to its origin.\n\n**Not daring to be first in the world** also has two aspects:\nFirst, to roam freely and nurture oneself, not hastening toward achievement—this is what is meant by “great vessels are late in completion,” the image of “sincere and substantial, radiant and luminous” in the *Great Accumulation* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*.\n\nSecond, to humble oneself and yield to others, treating them as a host treats guests—this is what is meant by “the great state flows downward.” The *Book of Changes*’ *Hexagram of Humility* says: “The humble noble one, crossing the great river”—such is its image. The Old Sage said: “The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel in lowliness; thus they become kings of the hundred valleys.” The *Book of Changes* says: “Humility brings prosperity. The Dao of Heaven aids the lowly and illumines them; the Dao of Earth, though humble, ascends. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of Earth alters the full and flows toward the humble. Ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the human Dao detests the full and favors the humble. Humility is honored and radiant; its lowliness cannot be surpassed—this is the noble one’s ultimate attainment.” This virtue of humble emptiness is what Confucius and Laozi both revered.\n\nCompassion is the virtue of benevolence; frugality is the virtue of purity. Not daring to be first in the world means no contention with the age, no competition with others, no opposition to things—this is the virtue of emptiness and selflessness. The virtue of benevolent compassion is what perfects others; perfecting others is how one perfects oneself. The virtue of frugality and restraint is how one cultivates oneself.\n\nPeople today know only frugality with wealth but not frugality with the mind, frugality with desires—accumulating essence and qi to nurture life. How could this be what the Old Sage meant by frugality? Master Tan said: “Water and fire are things in constant use; if used improperly, they can ruin a household—this is due to lack of simplicity. Food and drink are things in constant consumption; if consumed improperly, they can destroy the body—this is due to lack of moderation. To remedy this, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality in listening nurtures emptiness; frugality in seeing nurtures spirit; frugality in speech nurtures qi; frugality in private affairs nurtures wealth; frugality in public affairs nurtures nobility; frugality at the gate and courtyard prevents theft; frugality in defense and guards prevents rebellion; frugality with consorts and concubines nurtures longevity; frugality of the heart transcends life and death. This is the key to the transformation of the myriad things.\n\nThe extravagant, though rich, are never satisfied; the frugal, though poor, always have surplus. The extravagant are always poor in heart; the frugal are always rich in heart. The extravagant favor close associates, which leads to excess; the frugal keep their distance, which leads to few faults. The extravagant, when serving a lord, will surely be humiliated; the frugal, when serving a lord, will surely preserve their emolument. The extravagant are full of worries; the frugal are full of joy. The extravagant love action; the frugal love stillness. The extravagant love difficulty; the frugal love ease. The extravagant love complexity; the frugal love simplicity. The extravagant love indulgence; the frugal love tranquility. There are those who use one vessel their whole lives without it breaking; there are those who wear one fur coat for ten years without it wearing out. Such people can immediately attain the Dao of purity and stillness.”\n\nThe above are Master Tan’s teachings on the transformative power of frugality, which perfectly align with the Old Sage’s principle of frugal virtue. The Old Sage placed “Great Compassion” at the head of the Three Treasures. He also said: “When Heaven is about to save someone, it protects them with compassion.” And again: “Always excel in saving people, always excel in saving things—thus nothing is discarded.” How then could followers of the Mysterious Principle indulge in slaughtering living beings to satisfy their appetites? To seek long life, one must wish for all beings to attain long life. Only this is called “universal and equal great compassion,” and only thus can one be a true disciple of Laozi. To discard the lives of others to prolong one’s own life is a grave violation of the teaching to “always excel in saving things”—such a one has strayed far from compassion.\n\n**4. The Household Teachings of Laozi**\nThe Old Sage said: “Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness.” And again: “Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life.” And again: “Serene, without sign; tranquil, like the sea; vast, like a valley.” And again: “Tranquility is supreme.” The *Zhuangzi*’s “Heavenly Dao” chapter says: “Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus the emperors, kings, and sages rested in them.” And again: “Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action—these are the root of the myriad things. When Yao faced south and ruled as lord, he illuminated this; when Shun faced north and served as minister, he illuminated this. Those who dwell in this above become emperors, kings, and sons of Heaven in virtue; those who dwell in this below follow the Dao of the mysterious sages and uncrowned kings. Those who retire to this and wander in leisure are revered by recluses of rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; those who advance with this to govern the world achieve great deeds, renowned fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.”\n\nThe eight characters—\"emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action\"—are the foundational principles of the Laozi school, the essence of profound learning, and may also extend to Confucianism and Buddhism. Truly, they are the universal path to entering the Dao and the guiding track for cultivating truth. All who study the teachings of Laozi and the lineages of the Literary and Alchemical traditions must adhere to them.\n\n\"Emptiness and stillness\" are the natural state of the original nature. Emptiness enables penetration; stillness brings clarity. \"Tranquility and silence\" eliminate desire, returning to simplicity and plainness. In solitude, one remains utterly alone; in non-action, the mind responds without contrivance, and the light of awareness becomes perfectly round. Thus, the Dao takes this as its root: \"In stillness, one becomes sagely; in action, one becomes kingly\"—all return to this. If scholars can achieve \"the interdependence of mind and breath,\" attaining great stillness and true stillness, they will resonate with this root and experience the self-realized realms of \"Heavenly Harmony\" and \"Heavenly Joy.\"\n\n**5. The Three Treasures of the Profound Tradition**\nThe Profound Tradition regards the ears, eyes, and mouth as the Outer Three Treasures, and original essence, original qi, and original spirit as the Inner Three Treasures. The Three Treasures of Laozi are the methods for establishing oneself in the world; the Three Treasures of the Profound Tradition are the essentials for refining and attaining truth.\n\nThus, the *Heart Seal Scripture* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" Combining these Three Treasures to form the elixir is called the Golden Elixir. Master Qianxu said: \"Original spirit is the spirit of primordial chaos, not the spirit of daily worries and thoughts; original qi is the qi at the dawn of creation, not the breath of mouth and nose; original essence is the most genuine essence, the essence that holds true constancy, not the essence of lustful indulgence. Only by obtaining and employing these three can one rescue the aged and infirm, replenish and extend life, return yang and transform the bones, and ascend to become a Heavenly Immortal of the highest grade.\"\n\nThe ears, eyes, and mouth are also called the Three Treasures because, in turning the light inward and reflecting, the value lies in self-perception; in the absence of sound and hearing, the value lies in self-listening. Beginners rely on these to observe and cultivate meditative concentration. The mouth, as the pivot of breath’s entry and exit, can emit sounds to expound the Dao and benefit beings, hence it is also called a treasure.\n\nIn the practice of the Profound Tradition, when inner and outer align, there are sayings such as \"mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture,\" \"the outer mouth attains the center, the inner mouth attains harmony.\" The deeper esoteric meaning is that the mouth is the cavern of emptiness, the image of true emptiness. The eyes are the opening of the mind’s eye, universally illuminating the ten directions—the image of \"great vision\" as described in the *Zhuangzi*. The ears are the awakening of the mind’s hearing, knowing all without obscurity. Thus, the precious ears, precious eyes, and precious mouth, pure and all-pervading, are boundless as empty space. There is no division between inner and outer, body and mind; the single true body fills the entire dharma realm.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Simple Explanations of Daoist Teachings* states: \"Begin by seeking in the initial stage, generally by calming the mind and reducing desires, first closing the Outer Three Treasures to nurture the Inner Three Treasures.\" It also says: \"Still the mind to nourish qi; quiet the mechanism to purify the mind. Essence, qi, and spirit are the Inner Three Treasures; ears, eyes, and mouth are the Outer Three Treasures. Always ensure the Inner Three Treasures do not wander after external things, and the Outer Three Treasures do not disturb the center. Let the breath be continuous and deep, entering the elixir field, making breath the husband and wife, spirit and qi the mother and child. When mother, child, husband, and wife gather without separation, the mind does not stray outward, thoughts do not wander, spirit does not roam, and essence does not move recklessly. Constantly steaming the four limbs, this is the orthodox path of the Golden Elixir.\"\n\nThe *Triple Concordance Scripture* states: \"The Three Treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be firmly sealed and not opened. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass. Turning and curving to see and hear, opening and closing in unison, they become the pivot and axle of the self, moving and stilling without exhaustion.\" This illustrates the initial work of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath.\n\nThe oral instruction says: The Great Jiangxi lineage, in its transmission, begins by regulating the breath using the method of inward hearing. Inward hearing listens to one’s own breath; the mind and breath interdepend. Relying solely on the ear’s faculty is most fitting for this method—the *Zhuangzi*’s \"no sound, no hearing.\" If this is contemplated alongside the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s \"Guanyin’s perfect penetration through inward hearing of self-nature,\" it may be called \"two lutes in one hall\" or \"two mirrors in one case,\" embodying the sublime fusion of Chan and Daoist cultivation.\n\n**6. The Three Transformations of the Profound Tradition**\nThe Three Transformations of the Profound Tradition are: first, qi transformation; second, spirit transformation; and third, emptiness transformation. Unifying these three is called \"Dao transformation,\" just as the Tiantai school of Buddhism’s three contemplations—emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle—do not depart from the one mind.\n\nThe so-called qi transformation involves the interdependence of mind and breath, becoming increasingly harmonious and subtle until spirit and breath both settle. With my emptiness and stillness, I externally receive the primordial true qi of the pre-celestial One, which steams and nourishes the constructive and protective qi, circulating and irrigating without obstruction. As the ancients said: \"Constantly let qi penetrate the joints, and naturally essence will be full and the valley spirit preserved.\"\n\nThe *Triple Concordance Scripture* states: \"Cultivate without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain, gently like spring rain, fluidly like melting ice. Flowing from head to feet, it ultimately ascends again, coming and going through the boundless, suffusing the entire vessel. Reversion is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Weed out long-standing impurities, and the subtle is harmoniously regulated. The path of the turbid becoming clear is that prolonged darkness will eventually brighten.\" This is the efficacy of the Daoist practice of qi circulating through the microcosmic orbit—this is called \"qi transformation.\"\n\nThe second, spirit transformation, occurs after the initial stage of the Profound Tradition’s refining of essence into qi is complete. The essence gate is closed, and one regains the purity of youth. Thereafter, spirit and breath settle together in emptiness. When the primordial true yang arrives, it circulates once around the physical body, and because the spirit is settled externally, it immediately unites with my dharmakāya, becoming one.\n\nShi Jianwu said: “Yang comes from the emptiness, embracing my master.” Because the spirit is settled and thus equally settled, the primordial spirit and primordial qi fuse into one furnace, forged into a single whole—Daoist texts call this the “Dao-embryo.” As the primordial spirit is nourished by primordial qi, it grows day by day, and the power of stillness deepens. When the ten-month gestation is complete, only the primordial spirit remains in serene illumination, unaware of qi, for qi has already dissolved. As suchness and serene illumination arise, the numinous light shines alone, the myriad forms merge in harmony, eating and sleeping cease, breath and pulse halt, and brightness endures day and night. Gradually one enters the immortal realm—this is the wondrous efficacy of “spirit transformation,” the efficacy of the spirit circulating through the macrocosmic orbit.\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*“Nine years of firing have passed in full,\nWhen suddenly the Heavenly Gate bursts at the crown.\nThe true person appears with great spiritual powers—\nFrom this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations.”*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: “When the firing of the macrocosmic orbit is complete, one sheds the embryo and changes the bones, wholly transforming into a single golden light. The earth becomes a treasure, the body generates another body, and the yang spirit departs the physical form.” The Buddhist tradition calls this the “mind-generated body,” while Daoists term it the “spirit person.” The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *“Having roamed the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the lineage of awakening,”* and also: *“Having formed and shed the embryo, one becomes a true child of the Buddha.”* This expresses the same meaning—this is called “spirit transformation.”\n\nThird, “emptiness transformation”: In the Profound Tradition’s cultivation, from beginning to end, one never departs from emptiness, practicing entirely within the emptiness beyond the body. The initial return to emptiness (that is, refining the self) and the final return to emptiness (that is, attaining the Dao) proceed as one continuous process—hence it is called the “Profound Emptiness Great Dao.” Focusing now on the final return to emptiness: upon first obtaining the “mind-generated body,” like a newborn infant, it is still weak, so one re-enters profound samādhi. With my emptiness, I connect to the emptiness of heaven and earth; with the emptiness of heaven and earth, I connect to the emptiness of the dharmadhātu. As emptiness interpenetrates, one enters this great emptiness samādhi. After prolonged stillness, spirit and emptiness transform together. The six directions are all mind; the six directions are all body. Merging boundlessly, there is only one perfect illumination, all-pervading and all-containing. One can manifest limitless body forms and immeasurable spiritual powers, universally entering the infinite dharmadhātu, effortless and uncontrived—wherever the mind turns, it is accomplished. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* calls this: *“No arising of kinds and species, yet the mind-generated body is attained.”* Daoists call this the “perfected person”—this is the efficacy of “emptiness transformation.”\n\nMaster Lü said: *“The dharmakāya crumbles and fills the emptiness.”*\nMaster Zhang said: *“The emptiness crumbles to reveal the whole body.”*\nThe Seventh Patriarch of the Chan School, Venerable Basumitra, transmitted this verse:\n*“The mind is one with the emptiness realm,\nManifesting the Dharma equal to emptiness.\nWhen emptiness is realized,\nThere is no right, no wrong.”*\nThe Eighth Patriarch, Venerable Buddhadāna, transmitted this verse:\n*“Emptiness has no inside or outside,\nThe mind and Dharma are likewise.\nIf one understands emptiness,\nOne attains the truth of suchness.”*\nThe Buddhist tradition names this the “King of Emptiness” or the “Dharma King Who Shatters Existence.” When Daoists reach the ultimate return to emptiness, shattering emptiness itself, transcending the world without reliance—is this not the King of Emptiness?\n\nThe Northern School’s Li Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* most precisely expounds the purport of the Profound Tradition’s emptiness transformation—scholars should study it deeply and thoroughly.\n\n**Appendix: Li Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness***\n\nTo become immortal, Buddha, or Confucian sage,\nThe Three Teachings transmit but one emptiness.\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who transcend\nAll cultivate within emptiness.\n\nTo learn immortality, emptiness and stillness are the elixir’s essence;\nTo learn Buddhism, abiding in emptiness is Chan’s culmination.\nAs for my learning of the sagely way—what is it?\nIn emptiness, without self, the heavenly principle is illuminated.\n\nThe Dao-body’s emptiness is wondrous and inexhaustible,\nHeaven and earth’s emptiness operates with qi in harmonious fusion.\nYin and yang’s transformations are propelled by emptiness’s push—\nIf one abides in emptiness, all becomes malleable.\n\nThe marvel of the returned elixir lies in the valley of emptiness (that is, the emptiness beyond the body),\nBegin by attaining emptiness and steadfastly guarding stillness (the spirit is released externally, following the breath).\nWhen emptiness is utterly empty, primordial qi congeals;\nIn stillness upon stillness, yang returns.\n\nAn empty mind and full belly are the Dao’s foundation;\nWhen the numinous emptiness is not obscured, it is time to gather the medicine.\nResponding to conditions with an emptied self is true daily practice;\nOne with the great emptiness is a true man-child.\n\nGathering lead in emptiness and stillness is effortless action;\nAdvancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows and key.\nAll drawing and adding, increasing and decreasing, proceed from emptiness;\nShattering emptiness, one attains great awakening.\n\nUltimately, the Dao is quiescent yet functional—\nTo resolve entanglements and dull sharpness, both must be upheld.\nHarmonizing light and blending with the world, forgetting self and others,\nOnly the self knows what lies before the image of the Lord.\n\nBefore the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below—\nAt the center, a single point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\nEight-sided and flawless, without cracks.\n\nThe four edges are firmly sealed, the primordial chaos is refined—\nThis is the mysterious female gate of central emptiness (indicating the emptiness beyond the body, the so-called “outer mystery pass”).\nIf one employs emptiness within non-emptiness,\nNaturally, opening and closing respond to heaven and earth (mind and breath interdepend, released into the external emptiness, coming and going—this is the wondrous function of natural emptiness).\n\nWhen the mysterious female gate opens, the work reaches its peak;\nThe spirit exits and enters here (the breath is subtly regulated).\nExiting and entering, returning again to emptiness (mind and breath settle together, merging with the great emptiness),\nSuddenly, a spring thunderclap on level ground (stillness gives rise to movement).\n\nWhen the thunderclap resounds, heaven and earth open—\nFrom the emptiness, a wheel bursts forth.\nRound and full, vast and luminous,\nWithout lack or excess, it illuminates the bamboo studio.\n\nThe master of the bamboo studio is most extraordinary,\nCarefully applying it to timely matters.\nAbiding the spirit in emptiness, moving in emptiness (seven characters in one line, encapsulating the wondrous subtleties of the elixir method),\nUttering words to reveal the message of emptiness (out of compassion, there are written teachings to share).\n\nThe emptiness reaches to the point of no-emptiness, cutting off all errors (seven characters encapsulating the three essentials of guarding against danger and considering peril),\nThe hidden emptiness gathers all of heaven and earth (revealing the wondrous Dao of the profound school).\n\nThe bamboo, hollow of heart and straight of joint, verdant and green—\nThis is the foremost mechanism for refining emptiness.\n\n(This song’s words are concise and apt, truly a rare work among elixir texts.\nThe venerable sage’s principle of \"attaining emptiness and preserving stillness\" is expounded without omission.\nWhen I diligently studied under Master Wang, he instructed me to master this song, saying: \"Otherwise, when I later speak with you of the external fire-timing, you will not believe it.\" Recorded here as an aside.)\n\nVII. The Four Dhyanas of the Profound School\nThe *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* sets forth four kinds of dhyana: \"the dhyana practiced by the foolish,\" \"the dhyana of contemplating meaning,\" \"the dhyana of clinging to true suchness,\" and \"the dhyana of all Tathāgatas.\"\nLiezi’s master, Master Hu, also spoke of four kinds of dhyana: \"earth-pattern dhyana,\" \"heaven-and-earth dhyana,\" \"Great Thoroughfare dhyana,\" and \"the dhyana that has never departed from my school.\"\nThe *Liezi · The Yellow Emperor* states: \"A divine diviner came from Qi to dwell in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi saw him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Master Huqiu, saying: 'At first, I took your Dao as the ultimate—yet there is something even more ultimate!'\"\n\nMaster Hu replied: \"I have shown you only its outward patterns, not yet its true substance—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs! You take the Dao to contend with the world, and so you must be seen through. Bring him here tomorrow, and let me show myself to him.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and said to Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is dead! Beyond remedy! He cannot last even ten days! I saw something uncanny—like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered and wept, his tears soaking his lapels, as he told Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him the *earth-pattern*—still and unmoving, as if my *virtue-power* were sealed. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and said to Liezi: \"Fortunate indeed that your master met me! He is recovering! The ashes show signs of life! I see his sealed *power* now shifting!\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him the *heaven-and-earth*—where names and realities do not intrude, yet the mechanism stirs from the heels. This is the shifting of sealed *power*. He glimpsed the nearness of my goodness. Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu once more. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and said to Liezi: \"Your master is unsettled; I cannot read him. Let him fast and purify himself, and I will observe him again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him the *Great Thoroughfare* where nothing obstructs me—he saw only the balance of my *qi-mechanism*.\"\n\nThe whirlpool of the salamander’s spiral forms an abyss; the still water’s swirl forms an abyss; the flowing water’s swirl forms an abyss; the overflowing water’s swirl forms an abyss; the surging water’s swirl forms an abyss; the spring water’s swirl forms an abyss; the dammed water’s swirl forms an abyss; the crashing water’s swirl forms an abyss; the rich water’s swirl forms an abyss—these are the Nine Abysses.\n\n\"Bring him again tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu once more. Before he could settle, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Master Hu said: \"Pursue him!\" Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. He returned and reported to Master Hu: \"He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.\"\n\nMaster Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and swaying ease, so he knew not who or what I was. Then I let him drift with the withered grass, let him become the flowing wave—thus he fled.\"\n\nAfter this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn, and he returned home. For three years he did not venture out, cooking for his wife, feeding pigs as he would feed people, and in all matters remaining unattached. He carved and polished only to return to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn clod, sealed off from the world’s dust, and thus he remained to the end.\n\n**Annotation:**\n\nMaster Hu possessed self-awakened sagely wisdom and the samādhi of self-reception. In the Mystery School, he may be called: \"the phoenix soaring through the clouds, unmatched across the ages.\" Only after this trial did Liezi’s heart submit, and he devoted himself single-mindedly to the Dao.\n\nLet us now explicate its meaning:\n\nFirst, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern. Earth is the surface. The grasses, trees, and forests are the patterns of Earth. They grow by day and lengthen by night, tranquil and still, showing no movement—this is the state of quiescence. The *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern is like the great Earth’s profound stillness; though treasures lie hidden within, they remain sealed and unrevealed. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: \"The divine wind is still, mountains and seas conceal the clouds. The heavens are free of drifting haze, the four *qi* bright and clear. The land of a kingdom—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all trace back to one origin, no longer high or low.\" This expresses the same idea: hidden and dense, with no mechanism to be seen. It is called \"the virtue of closure,\" where the spirit shaman sees only his seated corpse-like stillness, his breath deep and harmonious. They mistake him for damp ashes, declare him near death—this is merely glimpsing his traces while failing to know his root. In Buddhism, this *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern is called *śamatha*, the ultimate image of stillness. The phrase *\"Alas, he does not tremble!\"* most aptly describes this meditative realm. To tremble is to stir; here, there is no self-movement, nor self-cessation—like a mountain’s steadfastness, the utmost of stillness.\n\nSecond, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of Heaven-and-Earth, which exhibits a slightly more lively aspect than Earth’s Pattern. Liu Xusi said: \"Heaven-and-Earth refers to the space between heaven and earth, more manifest than Earth’s Pattern.\" Xuanjing said: \"Heaven-and-Earth is emptiness. Within emptiness, yet not empty, there flows a single *qi*, the mechanism of ceaseless generation. All things receive it and sprout—this is what is called *‘the good is in the incipient.’*\" The *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern transcends movement and stillness. Here, in Heaven-and-Earth, though name and reality are both forgotten, the mechanism arises from the heels. The spirit shaman perceives only \"the power of closure\" and a semblance of recovery, yet this is merely grasping its surface. The stillness of the perfected is profound and silent; their movement is the motion of heaven—both emerge from effortless response. How can one fixate on a single aspect and presume to discuss it? This *dhyāna* of Heaven-and-Earth is called *vipaśyanā* in Buddhism, meaning \"contemplation\" or wisdom. *Śamatha* is cessation, stillness, concentration.\n\nThird, Master Hu demonstrated \"the Great Thoroughfare without trace.\" \"Without trace\" means the utmost of emptiness and void, with no sign to be imitated. The *Zhuangzi* renders this as \"the Great Thoroughfare cannot be overcome,\" an error in transcription. \"Balancing the mechanism of *qi*\" is like water’s perfect stillness. As Caoshan said: \"Harmoniously without inner or outer, fused and level above and below.\" Xiang Xiu said: \"Abiding at the extreme of the Great Thoroughfare, the heart is limpid and anchored, mysteriously one with all realms, leaving no trace—this is the utmost of emptiness.\" Below, the nine depths are enumerated, yet the water’s nature—placid and unperturbed, profoundly silent—remains unchanged. This shows the perfected one’s effortless response to circumstances, entering the undifferentiated samādhi amid differentiated realms, and manifesting a differentiated form within the undifferentiated samādhi. Thus, the spirit shaman could not fathom him, dismissing it as \"inconsistent\"—his skill was exhausted. This *dhyāna* of the Great Thoroughfare without trace, the marvel of balancing the *qi*-mechanism, is the wondrous realm where mind and environment are thus, stillness and illumination simultaneous, yet both forgotten. In Buddhism, this is called *yuganaddha*, the \"wondrous contemplation of the Middle Way.\"\n\nFourth, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of \"never yet departed from my source.\" The source is the source of the mind. Every wondrous function arises from one’s own nature; the entire body appears and vanishes, its transformations boundless, yet never leaving the present thought. This is self-awakened sagely wisdom, the realm of self-awakening. Whether coughing, waving an arm, grasping a staff, raising a tablet, blinking, or raising an eyebrow—all are the supreme truth. Neither sage nor ordinary being can fathom it. This is precisely what the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* calls \"the Tathāgata’s *dhyāna*.\" \"Withered grass\" describes its boundless appearance; \"flowing wave\" depicts its following the current. At this point, the spirit shaman was at a loss. Beyond the reach of ear, eye, mind, or intention, he unwittingly lost himself and fled. This closely resembles the episode where Tang Dynasty Master Huizhong tested the \"mind-reading\" Great Ear Tripiṭaka (the master asked the monk thrice: \"Where is this old monk now?\" The monk could not answer, and the master rebuked him: \"You fox spirit! Where is your mind-reading now?\" The monk had no reply). Thereafter, Liezi returned home, forgot the distinction between self and other, and underwent rigorous refinement. Solitary and unmatched, he was able to realize and verify. *\"Thus he remained to the end\"* means: grasping the One, all affairs are complete. The sage embraces the One as the model for the world.\n\n**Eight. The Ten Virtues of the Mystery School**\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: \"The Ten Virtues first establish the foundation, together flying with the Seven Awakening Factors.\" It also says: \"The Eightfold Vision of the Grand Clarity proclaims the true script of the Ten Virtues.\" This refers to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mouth, and mind returning to their original state, the true nature perfectly fused. The eight consciousnesses do not arise; *qi* harmonizes and the Dao is established. Radiant and resplendent, the Ten Virtues are fully realized. The Ten Virtues: the number five pertains to earth; two earths combined form a jade tablet, hence the Ten Virtues—this is one explanation. The Mystery Teaching also has its own Ten Virtues: constancy, harmony, purity, clarity, subtlety, joy, simplicity, emptiness, and gentleness.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: \"Those who meet in the Dao do nothing yet attain stillness.\" It also says: \"Great stillness holds it.\" And again: \"An empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides where it rests.\" The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Great stillness preserves the true.\"\n\nIn the Mystery Teaching, when supreme stillness brings spiritual tranquility, the mind becomes profoundly serene, and all moving phenomena naturally cease to arise. Reaching the realm of immovability, birth-and-death are extinguished, and quiescent extinction manifests. Wondrously entering the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, one accords with the transformation of non-action and attains the inconceivable divine function. This is called the virtue of stillness.\n\nIn the Mystery Teaching, when the marvelous union of mind and breath occurs, spirit and *qi* harmonize and fuse, drawing celestial harmony through human harmony. Having attained the primordial, snow melts and ice dissolves, forming a single mass of supreme harmony. This *qi* circulates and fills, permeating and blending, dissolving all yin obstructions, and the Great Elixir naturally forms.\n\nThe ancient sages said: \"To know harmony is called constancy.\" The *Zhuangzi* states: \"Rising and falling, harmony is the measure.\" The *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* says: \"One *qi* harmonizes with supreme harmony; attaining the One, all is at peace.\" The *Scripture of Great Penetration* says: \"Attain stillness without movement; attain harmony without change.\" The *Scripture of the Heart Seal* says: \"Supreme harmony overflows, and bones scatter like cold jade.\" This is the cultivation of harmony, called the virtue of harmony.\n\nAs for purity, the Mystery Teaching fundamentally establishes its teachings on clarity, stillness, and unity. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Profound emptiness, clarity, and harmony—flowers penetrate and lead to mysterious brightness.\" Through the interdependence of mind and breath, the mind becomes still and undisturbed, the six senses are purified, and further, the six consciousnesses and six dusts are purified, extending even to the ten directions, the boundless realm of lands, all simultaneously purified. Entering this great gate of purity, one attains unhindered, free, and liberated existence.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"In the nine revolutions of the mirror, clarity arises; riding the light, one enters the fourfold brightness.\" The *Mysterious Accord* states: \"Profound subtlety is pure, and the sage’s ears commune with the divine. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are empty and bright. The profound emptiness is pure, and the mysterious breath connects with *qi*. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are empty and clear. The profound void is pure, and the numinous tongue flowers with communication. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are mysteriously bright. The profound truth is pure, and transformations respond naturally. The Dao pervades and endures, manifesting in all ten directions.\"\n\nThus, turning away from dust and returning to awakening, transforming defilement into purity, when the mind is pure, the land is pure—dependent and proper revolve in harmony. The true realm of quiescent light manifests effortlessly, called the Treasury of Pure Brightness. Through this, one benefits oneself and others, together escaping the sea of suffering and ascending the shore of the Dao, most surpassing and supreme. Therefore, this virtue of purity is most revered and exalted.\n\nAs for brightness, because the original body is pure, wisdom-light arises, illuminating the ten directions without obstruction. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Numinous light shines in eight directions, and the ten thousand spirits all arise.\" It also says: \"Flowing radiance of the six luminaries disperses distant obscurity.\" And again: \"Within the bright light of the profound, the true scripture of the Primordial One.\" And: \"The ten flower-like wondrous practices of the immortals subdue demons and generate the sixfold brightness.\" And: \"Profound vision perceives the unobstructed emptiness; the Primordial Beginning communicates its brightness. The dark pearl reveals its true form; inner and outer are clearly illuminated.\" And: \"The profound source and profound brightness—all myriad paths arise from their communication.\" And: \"The pure light of the profound source possesses its own efficacy.\" And: \"The profound and subtle is without obstruction, transforming the utmost of all hidden spirits.\" And: \"Stillness, harmony, wondrous brightness, and awakening—the mysterious breath naturally brings long life.\" And: \"The profound void manifests harmony and purity; flowers penetrate and lead to mysterious brightness.\"\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* says: \"When supreme stillness is secure, sagely wisdom is complete; when sagely wisdom is complete, wisdom-light arises; when wisdom-light arises, one becomes one with the Dao.\" The ancient sages said: \"To know constancy is called brightness.\" The *Zhuangzi* says: \"Nothing is better than to be bright.\" Thus, profound brightness and quiescent illumination are unobstructed and perfectly fused. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When brightness reaches its utmost, it is the Tathāgata.\" This is called the virtue of brightness.\n\nAs for the wondrous, emptiness and existence interpenetrate, the dependent and the proper intermingle, mind and realm become one, entering the source of equality at the boundary. The true nature is perfectly fused, unobstructed and all-pervading. The ancient sages called it \"the gate of all wonders.\" The *Scripture on Nourishing Life* says: \"Recognizing the non-emptiness of dharmas, perceiving without obstruction, one enters the gate of all wonders and naturally awakens.\"\n\nIn the initial practice of the scholar, when spirit and breath marvelously unite, body and mind harmonize and fuse, this is the preliminary step before entering the gate of all wonders. Thus, the wondrous virtue of the Mystery Teaching encompasses all dualities, perfectly fusing them into non-duality. Form and emptiness are without obstruction; body and mind intermingle, entering the Dharmadhātu of Samantabhadra, the layered realm of the imperial net. Truly, this is beyond what words, thoughts, or contrivance can reach. This is called the wondrous virtue.\n\nAs for constancy, the ancient sages called it \"constant virtue.\" The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* calls it \"eternal abiding.\" The ancient sages said: \"Constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant; constant virtue does not err, returning to the ultimate.\" And: \"To be the valley of the world, constant virtue is sufficient.\" The *Scripture of Purity* says: \"The true and constant responds to phenomena; the true and constant attains its nature.\" And: \"The Dao of the true and constant is attained by those who awaken to it.\"\n\nThis true and constant nature is the source of the Dao. Those who accord with it attain the Dharma-nature body, eternally abiding and indestructible. Thus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls it: \"The eternally abiding true mind, the inherently pure bright essence.\" The ancient golden sages of great awakening all perfectly realized this mind, entering the ocean of the wondrously awakened fruit. The nature arises without action, universally manifesting the Dharmakāya.\n\nThe Four Virtues of Nirvāṇa place constant virtue at the forefront, precisely for this reason.\n\nAs for *bliss*, it is the joy of self-awakened sagely wisdom, also called the bliss of quiescent nature or celestial bliss. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Harmony with others is called human joy; harmony with Heaven is called celestial joy. Those who know celestial joy move with the course of Heaven in life and transform with things in death. At rest, they share the power of yin; in motion, they flow with the waves of yang.\" This celestial harmony and celestial joy are the principles revered by the Mystery Teachings, truly essential elements of the art of superior life—this is the virtue of bliss.\n\nAs for *purity*, it refers to the original essence of self-nature, wondrous and innate, beyond delusion or awakening. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The pure and unadorned Way guards only the spirit; guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. When the essence of oneness penetrates, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order. Thus, *purity* means having nothing mixed with it; *simplicity* means not diminishing the spirit. Those who embody purity and simplicity are called *true persons*.\" To see the plain and embrace the uncarved—thoughts are few, desires are scarce. All worldly splendor arises only after birth; the original source of self-nature is pure, tranquil, empty, and still, before emotions and consciousness stir—what desires or habits could there be? Thus, the Mystery Teachings return to truth and restore simplicity, merging with the Dao in reality. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Unchanging oneness is the ultimate stillness; nothing opposing it is the ultimate emptiness; no interaction with things is the ultimate blandness; nothing contrary to it is the ultimate purity.\" This is the virtue of purity. The *Book of Changes* speaks of \"plain treading\" and the image of \"white adornment,\" both aligning with the Mystery Teachings' path of \"seeing the plain and nurturing simplicity.\"\n\nAs for *emptiness*, to abandon form and forget the body, serene as if nothing exists—this is \"bodily emptiness.\" To sever thoughts, forget knowledge, empty the three temporal realms, dissolve emotions, and extinguish consciousness—this is \"mental emptiness.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Only the Dao abides in emptiness.\" And: \"Emptiness and tranquility accord with Heaven’s virtue.\" And: \"Rest leads to emptiness; emptiness leads to fullness; fullness leads to order. Emptiness leads to stillness; stillness leads to movement; movement leads to attainment. The body operates through emptiness; the mind is numinous through emptiness.\" Thus, the ancient sages said: \"Attain the ultimate emptiness; guard perfect stillness.\" The Mystery Teachings take \"emptiness\" as their return, just as the Buddhists take \"emptiness\" as their return—this is the virtue of emptiness.\n\nAs for *softness*, it is the harmonious and unified qi, subtle and moistening, steaming and nourishing the constructive and defensive energies, renewing the old and forging the new. After the great cycle, true emptiness refines the form, returning from being to non-being, and the body transforms into qi. Thus, the ancient sages said: \"Concentrate qi to attain softness—can you be like an infant?\" And: \"The softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest. The insubstantial enters where there is no gap.\" \"When things grow strong, they age—this is called not following the Dao; not following the Dao leads to early demise.\" And: \"In life, humans are soft and weak; in death, they are hard and stiff. Plants in life are soft and fragile; in death, they are withered and dry. Thus, the hard and strong belong to death; the soft and weak belong to life.\" And: \"Nothing under Heaven is softer than water, yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard. The victory of softness over hardness—none under Heaven do not know it, yet none can practice it.\" And: \"To guard softness is called strength.\" The Mystery Teachings transform qi, changing hardness into softness—this is the essential element for emerging from death and entering life. Concentrate qi to attain softness, and longevity and enduring vision are assured—this is the virtue of softness.\n\nThe above ten virtues, when unified, form *mysterious virtue*. When divided into ten, each has its excellence. When the ten virtues are perfected, the Dao is established.\n\n**Nine. The Ten Penetrations of the Mystery Teachings**\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"The Cavern Source and Cavern Illumination—from their union, the myriad Dao arise.\" And: \"Cavern Illumination is pure and luminous; the Emperor’s mind attains great spiritual penetration.\" And: \"The Ten Penetrations arise from this; wondrous practices flourish thereby.\" And: \"First is penetration of qi, then penetration of spirit, finally penetration of numinosity. When the myriad penetrations perfect reality, the Dao is complete, and one ascends to the celestial throne.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"When the ears and eyes inwardly penetrate and the mind’s knowledge is outwardly forgotten, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so humans?\" This power of spiritual penetration arises from meditative concentration.\n\nLesser Vehicle immortals attain only the Five Penetrations: divine power, celestial vision, celestial hearing, knowledge of others’ minds, and knowledge of past lives. Greater Vehicle immortals, beyond these Five Penetrations, also attain the penetration of the exhaustion of outflows, making Six Penetrations. As for the Great Vehicle and Great Awakening Golden Sages, they attain the Ten Penetrations. These are:\n\n1. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Knowing Others’ Minds**: With this penetration, one knows the minds of beings in a trichiliocosm without difference, as in a single world. Extending to hundreds of thousands of nayutas of worlds, one can discern and know the minds of all beings.\n\n2. **Penetration of the Unobstructed and Pure Celestial Eye Wisdom**: With this penetration, one clearly sees all beings in the ten directions—dying here and being born there, ascending to good realms or descending to evil realms, bearing marks of fortune or sin.\n\n3. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Recollecting Past Lives**: With this penetration, one knows the events of past lives spanning incalculable eons—where one was born, one’s name, clan, experiences of joy and suffering, and all the births and rebirths in the cycle of existence since beginningless time.\n\n4. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Knowing the Future Until Its End**: With this penetration, one knows all events in the future spanning incalculable eons—unfathomable as motes of dust in number.\n\n5. **Penetration of the Unobstructed and Pure Celestial Ear Wisdom**: With this penetration, one hears all sounds across every land in the ten directions, whether one wishes to hear them or not, freely and at will.\n\n6. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Non-Substantiality**: With this penetration, one can travel to all buddha-lands in the ten directions without moving from the original ground, benefiting sentient beings.\n\n7. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Discerning All Beings’ Speech**: With this penetration, one knows and distinguishes all the varied speech of beings in worlds as numerous as motes of dust in an ocean of buddha-lands.\n\n8. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Manifesting Limitless Color-Bodies**: With this penetration, one can manifest boundless, wondrous color-bodies to draw near those to be transformed, awaken them, and perform the work of liberating beings through various miraculous powers.\n\n9. **Penetration of the Wisdom of All Dharmas**: With this penetration, one skillfully expounds the unobstructed Dharma-gate, spreading Dharma-clouds and showering Dharma-rain, using wondrous sounds to reveal, instruct, awaken, and lead beings to attain pure liberation.\n\n10. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Entering the Cessation of All Dharmas**: With this penetration, one abides in samādhi’s true concentration while universally manifesting color-bodies, like light and shadow appearing everywhere, yet remaining unmoving in samādhi.\n\nThese ten penetrations are what the Great Awakened Golden Immortal realizes, called the *Dao-Penetration*, entering the ocean of perfect enlightenment—beyond the reach of lower stages.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Superiorities of the Mysterious Teaching**\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching possesses many superior qualities; to summarize its essence, there are ten:\n\n1. **Superiority of Health**\nMaster Zhou of the Song Confucians said: *\"Abundance and warmth are great wealth and honor; health and peace are priceless gold.\"* Yet while abundance and warmth are easily attained, the blessing of health and peace is not enjoyed by all. Even when obtained, it is fleeting—suddenly, old age arrives, vitality declines, and illness assails. The cultivator of the Mysterious Teaching differs: nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, body and mind remain robust, never decaying with age. By harnessing the primordial qi, refining the physical form, and transforming the mortal substance, the mortal substance is wholly transmuted, yin exhausted and yang purified. Thus, Chen Cuixu said:\n*\"Through the body shines golden light, the marrow fragrant,\nGolden sinews and jade bones—pure yang.\nRefining the red blood to flow as white,\nYin qi dissolves, the body naturally healthy.\"*\nThis is the first preeminent benefit in present enjoyment.\n\n2. **Superiority of Purity**\nThe Daoist teaching transforms through purity and stillness. The practitioner, through the interdependence of mind and breath, returns to the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, the state of great concentration. The celestial yang-qi of heaven and earth arrives unbidden, as it is said: *\"With my true emptiness, I resonate with that wondrous being.\"* The turbid is transmuted into pure yang, the mortal form refined into a numinous body. One feels worldly toils gradually recede, desires no longer intrude, no demons disturb, and the six senses become empty and still—body and mind at peace. *Zhuangzi* calls this *\"wandering in heaven,\"* while the *Scripture of Salvation* states: *\"The heavens are free of floating haze; the four qi shine clear and bright.\"* The mind-ground is likewise—this is the second superiority of purity and tranquility.\n\n3. **Superiority of Leisure**\nLeisure here means ease, not dissipation. Unaffected by honor or disgrace, unmoved by power or rank, one retreats from the world without melancholy, embracing the One in profound stillness. The mind is at ease, free of affairs; all burdens are cast aside. Joyful and content, serene and composed, one guides without leading, responds only after being moved. *Zhuangzi* said: *\"Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the equilibrium of heaven and earth, the perfection of the Dao—thus do emperors and sages rest in them.\"* The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *\"Observe the will, roam the spirit through the three numinous powers; at leisure, without care, the mind is at great peace.\"* And again: *\"With folded hands and non-action, the body is naturally at ease; when the body is empty of things, the mind is naturally free. Cultivating harmony, one abides alone in the true person’s palace, wandering in the garden of virtue, free from desires.\"* And: *\"Practicing the Dao in ease, dwelling alone, nurturing life and guarding emptiness—what thoughts or worries arise? With wings fully grown, one soars aloft, living long and gazing afar, then taking flight.\"* This is the wondrous leisure of body and mind in the Mysterious Teaching, akin to the ancient Chan masters’ *\"unlearned, non-active, leisurely Daoist.\"* Whether in the world or beyond it, this is the greatest enjoyment—this is the third superiority, that of leisure.\n\n4. **Superiority of Auspiciousness**\nThe Old Master practiced non-action, acting without attachment, accomplishing without abiding. Harmonizing with the world, blending light with dust, neither seeking nor rejecting, he remained still as empty space—thus, all his movements were auspicious. This is the virtue of non-contention, the wondrousness of non-attachment. Without intent toward self or other, without emotion toward coming or going, like flowing water or drifting clouds, without favor or aversion, one is carefree and at ease, transcendent and unburdened, following conditions with openness, following nature with freedom. *Zhuangzi* said: *\"Nothing is not forgotten; nothing is not present. In profound tranquility without limit, all beauties follow.\"* How auspicious is this! This is the fourth superiority, that of auspiciousness.\n\n5. **Superiority of Longevity**\nThe *Hongfan* chapter of the *Book of Documents* lists *\"five blessings,\"* with longevity among them. The *Book of Songs* sings of *\"brow-longevity\"* and praises *\"longevity like the Southern Mountains.\"* The cultivator of the Mysterious Teaching, having established the foundation of the elixir, gains mastery over life, roaming freely among grotto-heavens and blessed lands, laughing and wandering in the realms of the Ten Continents and Three Islands.\n\nLi Tuo’s eight hundred years and Anqi’s three thousand—such are the spans of the immortals. The Venerable Immortal of Broad Longevity of the Southern Culmen, born in high antiquity, had by the early Ming already reached ten thousand years of age, as clearly attested in the annals of the immortals. Thus Zhang Ziyang declared: *\"A single grain of the numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—only then do I know my life is not ruled by Heaven.\"* The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: *\"All men eat grain and the five flavors, but I alone consume the Great Harmony of yin and yang qi, and thus do not die, for Heaven’s favor is already mine.\"* It further says: *\"Seal the Gate of Life as if it were a jade capital—longevity will be transmitted for ten thousand years and more.\"* Chen Guanzhi observed: *\"This shore’s waves are left behind; only upon reaching that shore does one know longevity may be attained. Once gained, it should be forever kept—like a raft crossing the river or a ladder ascending to Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Daoist teaching of long life and enduring vision finds its superiority precisely in longevity. The celestial palaces of Lang Garden may be freely inhabited. Though mulberry fields turn to azure seas, one remains carefree and at ease—this is the fifth distinction, that of longevity.\n\n6. **Superiority of Other-Power**\nThe Three Primordials Elixir Methods of the Mysterious Teaching—Earth Primordial and Heaven Primordial—both pertain to the ingestion of external elixirs. With but a single *daogui* measure taken into the mouth, one sprouts feathered wings in broad daylight. Without passing through stages, one is instantly transformed from mortal to sage. The marvel of such divine transformation defies all thought. It can deliver deceased kin, restore desiccated bones to life—such inconceivable expedient methods belong to the Mysterious Teaching alone. This is its sixth distinction.\n\n7. **Superiority of Homestead Ascension**\nBy virtue of the surpassing efficacy of the divine elixir, one may cause an entire clan to ascend together, the whole household rising in flight. As with the Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang of the Jin, who ascended with his father’s clan, forty-two immortal kin, and six disciples, all at once—even the chickens and dogs followed in their flight. Such grandeur of *\"homestead ascension\"* is unique to the Mysterious Teaching, rarely seen in other traditions. This is the seventh distinction.\n\n8. **Superiority of Lineage Transmission**\nThe Daoist lineage of the Mysterious Teaching stretches far into the past, transmitted from master to master without interruption for thousands of years. The lamp of the Dharma has never been extinguished. Into the infinite future, its radiance will only grow brighter. All karmic encounters and circumstances are realized in the present—this is the eighth distinction.\n\n9. **Superiority of Transmission**\nBuddhist Dharma is divided into the True Dharma, Semblance Dharma, and Final Dharma ages. The ancient immortals of the Mysterious Teaching manifest in the world through the Dharmakāya, their bodily presence and speech guiding those with karmic affinity. For thousands of years, they have remained unchanged, as the Dao Ancestor has no day of *nirvāṇa*. The True Dharma abides in the world without temporal limit—this is the ninth distinction.\n\n10. **Superiority of Writings**\nBuddhist scriptures were all compiled by disciples from recollections. The Daoist scriptures of the Mysterious Teaching, however, were personally composed by the Dao Ancestor, spoken directly from his own mouth. To recite them is to hear his voice, as if seeing his person—this is the tenth distinction.\n\n11. **The Seven Greatnesses of the Mysterious Teaching**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Xu Wugui\"* chapter states: *\"To know the Great Oneness, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Equality, the Great Square, the Great Faith, and the Great Stability—this is perfection. The Great Oneness unites them; the Great Yin dissolves them; the Great Eye sees them; the Great Equality conditions them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Stability upholds them. They exhaust Heaven’s being, follow illumination, darkly possess the pivot, and begin with the other. Thus, to dissolve them is as if not dissolving; to know them is as if not knowing. Only after not knowing does one come to know.\"*\n\nThe commentary explains: The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s Seven Greatnesses reveal the wondrous Suchness of the Tathāgatagarbha, all-pervading and all-containing, manifesting the marvel of inherent virtue. The *Zhuangzi*’s Seven Greatnesses not only express inherent virtue but also cultivated virtue. Inherent and cultivated virtues are non-dual, encompassing both root and branch. The *\"Great Oneness unites them\"* already encompasses the *Śūraṅgama*’s Seven Greatnesses—earth, water, wind, fire, space, consciousness, and faculties.\n\n*\"The Great Stability upholds them\"* expresses cultivated virtue, aligning cultivation with inherent nature, so that karmic consciousness is forgotten and celestial truth appears. Wisdom illumines boundlessly, dark response is inexhaustible—this is what is meant by *\"exhausting Heaven’s being, following illumination, darkly possessing the pivot.\"*\n\nHere, *\"the Great Yin dissolves them\"* also expresses cultivated virtue. As the Old Sage said: *\"Returning to the root is called quiescence; quiescence is called recovering life; recovering life is called constancy.\"* The Great Yin is the virtue of stillness, the image of *kun*. The Great Eye is the universal eye. *\"The Great Eye sees them\"* expresses resultant virtue—the Dharma-eye, seeing through the Dharma-realm.\n\n*\"The Great Equality conditions them\"* expresses the virtue of transforming others—great equanimous compassion, universally covering all beings. *\"The Great Square embodies them\"* expresses inherent virtue—the interpenetration of body and realm, the image of principle and phenomena in perfect fusion.\n\n*\"The Great Faith verifies them\"* further expresses cultivated virtue. Faith is the source of the Dao, the mother of merit, the foremost of the myriad practices. Only with great faith can one realize great fruition; there has never been one who practiced without faith or realized without practice. Thus, these Seven Greatnesses encompass all causes, practices, and realizations without omission.\n\nThe final phrase, *\"Only after not knowing does one come to know,\"* perfectly accords with the *Prajñāpāramitā*’s *\"knowing nothing yet knowing all\"*—truly a meeting of Chan and the Mysterious. Lu Xixing’s *Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence* says: *\"These terms are all coined by Zhuangzi himself. The Great Oneness refers to the undifferentiated primordial state. The Great Yin refers to utmost stillness without response. The Great Eye is differentiated and named. The Great Equality means sameness without distinction.\"*\n\nThe Great Vastness is boundless yet unobstructed. The Great Faith contains within it the faith of faith itself. The Great Stillness is the stillness that stills all stillness—these are all what Heaven deems supreme, perfect, and utterly exhaustive, leaving no residue.\n\nIn relation to the Great Oneness, one *pervades* it. To pervade it is to abide in the state before the arising of the ten thousand things, where one may drift and float but cannot seek through thought or deliberation—hence it is called *pervading*.\n\nIn relation to the Great Yin, one *dissolves* into it. To dissolve is to be in the state of utmost stillness without response, where the mind may merge but cannot be grasped by names or forms—hence it is called *dissolving*.\n\nThe Great Eye may then accommodate our vision. The Great Equality may be followed in pursuit. The Great Vastness may be embraced in its entirety. The Great Faith may be examined for its timely movements. The Great Stillness may be grasped by its constancy. To know what Heaven deems supreme is thus.\n\nThis exposition of the Seven Greatnesses in *Zhuangzi* is subtly wondrous and perfectly harmonious. To know these Seven Greatnesses is true knowledge. If one fully comprehends them, one merges with the Dao in truth and attains transcendent freedom.\n\n---\n\n**XII. The Precepts of the Mysterious School**\n\nThe precepts of Daoism are scattered across various texts. Generally, precepts serve to restrain evil, collect the mind, and perfect the virtue of purity, tranquility, and unity. When the mind is single-mindedly devoted to the Dao, evil naturally vanishes; harmony arises, and all perverse qi dissipates. Thus it is said: *\"One of profound virtue is like a newborn babe—poisonous creatures do not sting, birds of prey do not strike, and tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons cause no harm.\"* This is called *\"the precepts shared by the Dao.\"* \"Shared\" means they are inherently possessed. Cultivating the Dao is the most excellent of virtuous practices; as the virtue of harmony is perfected, the precepts are naturally fulfilled. Thus, apart from the Dao, no separate precepts need be established—hence they are called *the precepts shared by the Dao*.\n\nThe formation of evil karma originates from evil intentions. If thoughts and distinctions are stilled, if one abides in utter quiescence, great stillness, profound non-action, and vast emptiness, then both good and evil are forgotten. If even thoughts do not arise, how can present karma be created? Thus, when the mind is settled in stillness, the virtue of precepts is perfectly realized. Apart from stillness, there are no precepts—this is called *\"the precepts shared by stillness.\"* *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Those who approach the Dao generate stillness without effort.\"* And again: *\"Gazing intently at his form, one sees only emptiness and void, seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing, grasping without obtaining. Radiant and luminous—who can attain this?\"* Behold how, in such stillness, the six senses become empty and silent, merging with the vastness of the Great Void—is this not the supreme manifestation of *\"the precepts shared by stillness\"*? These two are the precepts of the highest vehicle. With body and mind purified, the Dao is naturally perfected, and all precepts are perfectly fulfilled.\n\nNext are the *precepts of gathering wholesome dharmas*. The Venerable Laozi said: *\"Dwell in good earth, let the mind be good and profound, be good in companionship, good in speech, good in governance, good in action, and good in timing.\"* Master Qianxu wrote in *Profound Insight*: *\"The highest good adapts to circumstances without contention, neither shunning difficulty nor seeking ease—this is dwelling in good earth. Abiding in stillness without contention, neither clinging to tranquility nor rejecting disturbance—this is the mind’s goodness and profundity. Acting with impartiality, without contention between self and other—this is good companionship. Attaining subtlety in following the flow, without contention between expedience and reality—this is good speech. Nourishing the ten thousand things without contention between near and far—this is good governance. Good in action means being both rounded and square. Good in timing means acting or resting as the moment demands. These seven are all like water, benefiting all without contention. Only by not contending are self and other forgotten, inner and outer harmonized—whence could resentment arise?\"* These seven kinds of goodness gather the three karmas of body, speech, and mind; they govern interactions with others, self-cultivation, and transforming others, extending even to every movement and gesture, all of which are subsumed and directed toward supreme goodness. When the wind of kindness and harmony prevails, the evil karma of beings silently dissolves, and all return to purity, tranquility, and unity—the transformation of mysterious virtue. Hence, they are called *\"the precepts of gathering wholesome dharmas.\"*\n\nNext are the *precepts of observing discipline*. The Venerable Laozi said: *\"The ancients who were good as scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, and too deep to be known. Because they could not be known, I forcefully describe their appearance: hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter; cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides; dignified, as if guests; yielding, as if ice about to melt; simple, as if uncarved wood; open, as if a valley; merged, as if turbid.\"* These seven metaphors describe the demeanor of one who embraces the Dao. *Zhuangzi*’s praise of Daoist discipline goes even further: *\"Abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet resounding like thunder, spirit moves and Heaven follows.\"* And again: *\"The True Person of old did not oppose the few, did not dominate success, did not scheme for advantage. Such a one, when erring, felt no regret; when correct, remained self-content. Such a one, climbing heights without trembling, entering water without getting wet, entering fire without feeling heat—this is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao in this way. The True Person of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The True Person’s breath reaches the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat. The True Person of old did not delight in life, did not detest death, exited without joy, entered without resistance—coming and going with effortless ease. Such a one’s mind was steadfast, countenance serene, forehead broad and expansive.\"*\n\nCold as autumn’s chill, warm as spring’s embrace,\njoy and anger flowing with the four seasons,\nharmonizing with all things in due measure—\nyet none fathom their boundlessness.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe True Person of old bore a countenance upright yet not assertive,\nappearing insufficient yet not yielding,\nopen and angular yet not rigid,\nexpansive and empty yet not ostentatious.\nWas there not a radiance like joy?\nA towering presence like inevitability?\nA deep hue that enhanced my complexion,\na stillness that stabilized my virtue,\na stern bearing like the world’s weight?\nAn aloofness beyond all constraint,\na continuity like fondness for seclusion,\na withdrawal that forgot all speech.\n\nIt is also said:\nIn their true humanity, they were authentic—\nhuman in form yet empty as heaven,\nclinging to nothing yet preserving the real,\npure yet accommodating all things.\nWhen things lacked the Dao, they met them with upright bearing,\nawakening them so that human intent dissolved.\n\nThis is the discipline of the Mysterious School,\nlike the divine dragon beyond all categorization—\nhence Confucius’ sigh of “like a dragon.”\n\nNext is the “Precept of Embracing All Beings,”\nfounded purely on great compassion and impartiality.\nThe Old Sage said:\n“What is good, I deem good;\nwhat is not good, I also deem good—\nthus virtue is perfected in goodness.\nWhat is trustworthy, I trust;\nwhat is untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthus virtue is perfected in trust.”\nThe Sage abides in the world,\ntrembling with care to blend all hearts under heaven.\nThe hundred clans fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nand the Sage treats them all as children.\n\nIt is also said:\n“Thus the Sage is ever skilled in saving people,\nand so none are cast aside;\never skilled in saving things,\nand so nothing is cast aside.”\nIt is also said:\n“The Sage is without anything not good—\nhow could there be anything to cast aside?”\n\nThis is the Mysterious School’s embrace of all beings,\nteaching without distinction,\nproof that none—even the icchantika—are abandoned.\n\nNext are the “Prohibitive Precepts.”\n“Prohibitive” means to restrain and halt.\nLike Confucius’ warnings against lust, strife, and acquisitiveness,\nor the Buddha’s prohibitions against killing, lust, theft, sexual misconduct, falsehood, and intoxication.\nThe Old Sage said:\n“Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace;\nknowing when to stop brings no peril.\nNo sin is greater than indulging desire;\nno disaster is greater than not knowing sufficiency;\nno fault is greater than the desire to acquire.”\nIt is also said:\n“Do not display what is desirable,\nand the heart will not be disturbed.”\nIt is also said:\n“The five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\ngalloping and hunting madden the mind,\nrare goods impede conduct.\nThus the Sage is for the belly, not the eyes—\nhence he rejects the one and takes the other.”\nIt is also said:\n“Block the openings, close the gates,\nand to the end of life there will be no toil.\nOpen the openings, further affairs,\nand to the end of life there will be no salvation.”\nIt is also said:\n“Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nreduce thoughts, diminish desires.”\nIt is also said:\n“Thus the Sage abandons excess, extravagance, and indulgence.”\n\nThis is the prohibitive precept of the Old Master.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n“Dispel the turbulence of ambition,\nuntie the knots of the heart,\nshed the burdens of virtue,\nclear the blockages of the Dao.\nWealth, honor, prominence, fame, profit—these six are the turbulence of ambition.\nAppearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, intent—these six are the knots of the heart.\nHatred, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness—these six are the burdens of virtue.\nAdvancing, retreating, taking, giving, knowledge, ability—these six are the blockages of the Dao.\nWhen these four sets of six no longer churn in the breast, there is rectitude.\nRectitude brings stillness,\nstillness brings clarity,\nclarity brings emptiness,\nemptiness brings non-action—\nand in non-action, nothing is left undone.”\n\nThis is the prohibitive precept of Master Zhuang.\n\nUnderstanding that the “Shared Dao” and “Shared Samadhi” are the root precepts,\nand following the Old Master and Zhuangzi’s precepts of embracing good dharmas,\nembracing discipline, embracing all beings, and prohibition—\nthen both principle and practice are complete,\nbenefiting self and others alike.\nThis is the precept study of the Mysterious School.\n\n---\n\n**13. The Mysterious School’s Teaching on Transcending Life**\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching guides sentient beings with the character “life,”\nadvancing from “having life” to “longevity,”\nand from “longevity” to wondrous union with “non-life.”\n“Non-life” is that which was never born.\nSince it was never born, it does not perish—\ntranscending both birth and death,\nthis is the ultimate station of longevity.\n\nFor beginners, the work lies in refining the self and laying the foundation,\nemptying the heart and filling the belly,\nnurturing the original essence—\nthis is still within the station of life.\nWhen thoughts are extinguished in dual silence,\nand great serenity is attained,\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n“At this moment, the breath ceases like a small death,\nforged into oneness—this is perfection.”\nThus one turns from the station of life to the station of non-life.\nMaster Lü said:\n“Having been born, kill life;\nbefore death, learn death—\nthen there is longevity.”\nThis is precisely that station.\n\nAfter seven days, the Great Celestial Cycle is completed,\nreopening the primordial chaos,\nreestablishing the womb—\nthis is called “great death, great life.”\nFinally, returning to emptiness and completing the Dao,\nboth merit and station are transcended,\nthe void is pulverized—\nthis is the ultimate attainment of the Dao.\n\nThus the teaching of transcending life undergoes four transformations,\nthe meaning of which is expounded as follows:\n\n**(A) Life**\n*Explanation:* Guarding the One, dwelling in harmony,\nthe nature and life-force are wholly restored.\n*Verse:*\nSwallows dart in the sunlit day,\nyellow cranes cry in the evening breeze.\nThe old garden brims with spring’s depth—\npair by pair, they sport among the blossoms.\n\n**(B) Non-Life**\n*Explanation:* Thoughts extinguished in dual silence,\nreturning to the Ultimate Non-Being.\n*Verse:*\nThe six senses function yet no message comes,\nall at once entrusted to the spring wind.\nA wisp of incense smoke drifts in idle clarity—\nbirds do not come, yet flowers bloom red.\n\n**(C) Non-Life Giving Life**\n*Explanation:* Reopening the primordial chaos,\nreestablishing the womb.\n*Verse:*\nDeath yields life—this is no common thing,\nsecret workings reveal another excellence.\nAt midnight, a skull hums a tune,\nan icy river bursts into flame—yet remains cool.\n\n**(D) Neither Non-Life Nor Life**\n*Explanation:* The void is pulverized,\nutterly without trace.\n\n**Verse:**\nPrinciple and phenomena both forgotten—\nwho dares to measure this?\nPerfectly round, without seam or fissure,\nit pervades all realms yet never hides.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n\"When form is whole and essence restored,\none becomes one with Heaven.\nEmbrace it and it forms a body;\ndisperse it and it becomes the beginning.\nWhen form and essence remain unharmed,\nthis is called the power of transformation.\nEssence refined to the utmost,\nit returns to merge with Heaven.\"\n\nThis is the Daoist teaching of transcending life. Viewed through the four turning positions above, one perceives the marvel of the Daoists’ benefit to life.\n\n**XIV. Externalizing the Body and Transforming Form**\nThe Old Sage says:\n\"Place the self behind, and the self leads;\nexternalize the self, and the self endures.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n\"Transforming form into immortality,\nit sinks into silence without sound.\"\n\nHanshanzi says:\n\"To benefit is to refine one’s essence—\nthis may be called true benefit.\nTo transform is to alter one’s form—\nthis may be called true transformation.\nOne who can both benefit and transform\nshall ascend to the register of highest immortals.\nOne who neither benefits nor transforms\nshall never escape the calamity of death.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West says:\n\"Those who practice benefit and transformation\nconstantly contemplate the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure).\n*Numinous* is spirit;\n*Treasure* is essence.\"\n\nI note: The Dao of externalizing the body and transforming form is the direct pointing of the profound school’s cultivation and realization.\n*Externalizing the body* means illuminating the emptiness beyond the body—a single move. Like one who moves a jar must stand outside it to turn it freely, so too with the Dao of transforming form. One must first relinquish this corporeal body, enter the emptiness beyond, and there concentrate spirit and regulate breath. Only then can one generate being from non-being and exhaust the wonders of the seven returns and nine restorations.\n\nThus, in the profound school’s elixir method, one begins by working in the emptiness beyond the body and concludes in that same emptiness. From start to finish, step by step, one never departs from emptiness, operating entirely in the external realm—yet all effects manifest in the corporeal body. Such as transforming hair, teeth, blood, and pupils, or even transmuting the coarse physical body into a subtle dharma-body. The root and the world undergo secret revolutions and shifts, until the moment of womb-transcendence and spiritual transformation, when one soars aloft in ascension, attaining the freedom of spiritual powers.\n\nThus, one who can externalize the body can transform its form.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\ndispersing like mist or wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs,\nthe complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.\nWhite hair turns black again,\nfallen teeth regrow in their original place.\nThe old man reverts to youth,\nthe aged woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamity,\nthis is called a *zhenren* (true person).\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"Nurturing essence and cultivating spirit,\ncommuning with the virtue of the Three Origins,\nessence overflows into the pores,\nsinews and bones become firm.\nAll evil is repelled,\nthe upright qi abides constantly.\nThrough long accumulation,\nform is transformed into immortality.\"\n\nThis is the proper path of the profound school’s cultivation, the efficacy of the union between Heaven and humanity.\n\n**XV. Dawn Clarity and Seeing the Unique**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Great and Venerable Teacher\" chapter says:\n\"Only after externalizing life can one attain *dawn clarity*;\nafter *dawn clarity*, one can *see the unique*;\nafter *seeing the unique*, one can transcend past and present;\nafter transcending past and present, one enters the realm of neither death nor life.\nThat which kills life does not die;\nthat which gives life does not live.\"\n\nThis is the profound school’s highest move.\n*Dawn clarity* means the five aggregates are utterly shattered, the nature of Heaven opens in clarity—like the first light of dawn, all yin is dispelled, and the myriad things are revealed. As the ancient worthies said: \"The solitary radiance of spirit shines, utterly detached from the roots of dust.\"\n\n*Seeing the unique* means penetrating the unborn and undying nature of dharma. All dharmas exist in duality, but this ocean of nature is one with everything, without duality—hence it is called *unique*.\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"seeing the unique,\" the *Liezi*’s \"doubting the unique,\" the Confucian school’s \"vigilance in solitude,\" and Chan Master Baizhang’s \"utterly alone and complete\"—all point to the essence of seeing nature. The three teachings converge here in their realization.\n\nOnly when the aggregate of consciousness is exhausted can one attain *dawn clarity* and *see the unique*, penetrating the nature of dharma to enter the realm of neither death nor life. Thus, the profound school’s thorough realization of the true and constant, its wondrous accord with non-birth, is no different from the Buddha’s \"Great Nirvana.\"\n\nLaozi’s \"seeing the plain,\" \"knowing the constant,\" and \"embracing the constant\" all reveal the wondrous essence of one’s original nature, identical to the *Zhuangzi*’s \"dawn clarity and seeing the unique.\" Yet commentators through the ages have failed to fully expound this, leaving Laozi’s teachings unable to harmonize with Buddhism and giving rise to disputes over superiority and inferiority—how lamentable!\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\"The elixir is the supreme treasure of the corporeal body,\nrefined to become inexhaustibly transformative.\nFurther, investigate the true source of nature,\nand decisively grasp the wondrous function of non-birth.\nNo need to wait for another life—\nbefore your eyes, attain the Buddha’s spiritual powers.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this,\nwho since has followed in her footsteps?\"\n\nThis is what is called \"the wondrous Dao of the supreme and most true, the subtlest essence of the highest vehicle\"—the ultimate destination of the profound school’s path to enlightenment.\n\nViewed through the two chapters above, the Dao of externalizing the body and transforming form, the subtlety of *dawn clarity* and *seeing the unique*, perfect both life and nature, cultivate life while accord with non-birth, thoroughly penetrating above and below, encompassing sudden and gradual, universally benefiting all roots—this may be called the quintessence of Chinese civilization, a rare and divine marvel. All who aspire to the study of nature and life, to the methods of self-cultivation, should explore and delve deeply into this.\n\n**XVI. The Vast and Mysterious Dao**\nThe profound school’s cultivation and realization begin with emptiness. Within it, refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit—all are practiced in the emptiness beyond the body. Even when form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth, emptiness remains the Dao’s field. Thus, it is called \"the vast and mysterious Dao.\"\n\nGuangchengzi said: “I shall depart from you, entering the Gate of the Boundless, to wander the Wilds of the Infinite.”\n\nLaozi said: “The Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted.” He further stated: “What cannot be seen is called *yi*; what cannot be heard is called *xi*; what cannot be grasped is called *wei*. These three cannot be fathomed, thus they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim. Endless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness. This is called the formless form, the imageless image—this is *huanghu*. Meeting it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its tail. Grasp the ancient Dao to master present existence. To know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao.”\n\nThis chapter fully reveals the purport of the vast and mysterious. The “ancient beginning” is the nameless origin of heaven and earth, which is simply the One Emptiness. Phrases such as “cannot be seen,” “cannot be heard,” “cannot be grasped,” “cannot be fathomed,” “neither bright nor dim,” “unnameable,” “formless,” and “imageless” exhaustively depict the “one move of emptiness.” Thus, those who cling to the physical body and fix their efforts upon the upper, middle, and lower *dantian* entirely contradict Laozi’s principle of “vast mystery.”\n\nZhuangzi said: “Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the ten thousand things.” He also said: “At rest, it is empty; empty, it is full; full, it is ordered. Empty, it is still; still, it moves; moving, it attains.” The commentary states: *Rest* means to lay everything down, leaving body and mind, inner and outer, utterly quiescent, reaching great samadhi. When emptiness is extreme, wondrous existence manifests. True emptiness is not empty—hence it is called *full*. An ancient master of the Chan school said: “To investigate the mind of the kingly Dharma, one must first exhaust emptiness, and only then can one accord with the non-empty virtue.” The meaning is the same.\n\nZhuangzi further said: “Vacuity and tranquility, non-action and blandness—these accord with the virtue of heaven.” The commentary states: *Vacuity* means to empty the mind; *non-being* means to void the body. When body and mind are empty and quiescent, movement and stillness are both forgotten, and the Dao naturally returns—hence it is said to “accord with the virtue of heaven.”\n\nZhuangzi also said: “Emerging without origin, entering without aperture, coming and going without visible form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is non-being. Yet within non-being there is non-non-being, and the sage conceals himself therein.” This is precisely the realm of “observing emptiness as empty, emptiness having no object of emptiness; when the object of emptiness is gone, even non-emptiness is empty; when non-emptiness is gone, there is only profound and constant stillness”—the ultimate of true vast mystery.\n\nMaster Lü said: “The whole world seeks wondrous apertures, but who in the empty vastness attains the true meaning?” Master Chongyang said: “To see true emptiness, the primordial void is the ancestral origin.” Master Yuyang said: “If in this life you wish to ascend the cloud path, you must unite with vacuity—without it, you cannot become immortal.” These ancient immortals admonish people with the essential principle of refining through vacuity.\n\nThus, Li Daochun said: “Cultivate the mind with vacuity, and the mind becomes still. Cultivate qi with vacuity, and qi becomes functional. Therefore, vacuity is the great root of all under heaven.” He further stated:\n\nTo become immortal, Buddha, or Confucian,\nThe three teachings transmit but one vacuity.\nFrom ancient times to now, those who transcend\nAll cultivate within vacuity.\nFor immortals, vacuity and stillness are the elixir’s essence;\nFor Buddhists, abiding in vacuity is Chan’s culmination.\nAs for me, how to learn the sage’s work?\nIn vacuity, without self, one illuminates heavenly principle.\nThe Dao-body’s vacuity is wondrous beyond measure;\nHeaven and earth revolve in vacuity, qi harmoniously fused.\nYin and yang’s transformations are vacuously impelled;\nIf one abides in vacuity, all becomes adaptable.\nThe wondrousness of the returning elixir lies in the valley of vacuity and non-being;\nBegin by attaining vacuity and steadfastly guarding stillness.\nVacuity upon vacuity, primordial qi congeals;\nStillness upon stillness, yang returns.\nAn empty mind and full belly are the Dao’s foundation;\nDo not obscure the numinous vacuity when gathering the medicine.\nEmptying the self to respond to the moment is true daily practice;\nOne with the great vacuity is a true man.\nGathering lead in vacuous stillness, acting through non-action;\nAdvancing fire with vacuity as the bellows.\nAll reduction and augmentation proceed from vacuity;\nShattering vacuity, one attains great awakening.\n\nHe also said:\nThe three and five merge into one, returning to vacuity;\nAfter returning to vacuity, even vacuity is gone.\nWhen non-non-being is also gone, profound stillness remains—\nThe Western barbarian is left beardless.\n\nNo writings on the Dao from ancient times to now have been as succinct and wondrous as these.\n\nThe secret formula states: Return the mind to vacuous quiescence, enter the body into non-action—its wondrousness lies in samadhi, and even more in forgetting. At the initial stage, begin outside the body, with mind and breath interdependent, causing spirit to congeal and breath to abide, merging with the great vacuity—this is the wondrous expedient for emptying body and mind, the orthodox gateway to entering the Dao under the pillar.\n\n**XVII. The Unattached True School**\n*Unattached* means having no abode, no clinging mind, forgetting things and forgetting cares, no self and no others. The purport of the unattached is expounded in Buddhism; here, we shall speak of it in terms of the profound school.\n\nLaozi said: “Profound and still, as if it exists; I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled.” He also said: “Sudden as the sea, drifting as if without place to rest.” This reveals the purport of the *unattached*—the wondrous practice of non-abiding.\n\nIn *Zhuangzi’s* “Free and Easy Wandering,” it is said: “The perfected person has no self; the spirit person has no merit; the sage has no name.” In *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, the text sets forth “transcending the world,” “transcending things,” and “transcending life,” all revealing the purport of forgetting emotions—the true meaning of the unattached.\n\nMaster Guanyin said: “The great self has no dwelling; forms and things naturally manifest. Its movement is like water; its stillness like a mirror; its response like an echo—thus its Dao is like things.”\n\n“This also reveals the mind’s non-abiding—thus its response to things is like the reflection in a mirror or the resonance of a bell, each perfectly corresponding to its measure. The wonder lies precisely in the two characters *wu ju* 無居 (‘non-dwelling’): *wu ju* means non-abiding in anything. Only when all attachment is absent can one wander freely beyond the myriad transformations, move in and out of the Three Realms, and attain unimpeded spontaneity.\n\nThe *Daodejing* repeatedly expounds the virtue of *bu shi* 不恃 (‘non-dependence’). As it says: ‘It gives birth but does not possess; it acts but does not depend; it accomplishes but does not dwell.’ ‘Supreme virtue does not act as virtue—therefore it has virtue. Inferior virtue does not lose virtue—therefore it has no virtue.’ It also says: ‘Heaven and earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.’ The so-called ‘non-benevolence’ refers to non-dependence on benevolent virtue. All these perfectly express the purport of forgetting merit.\n\nThe unattached adept establishes neither the two extremes nor the middle way; they do not abide in birth-and-death yet move in and out of birth-and-death, do not abide in defilement and purity yet move in and out of defilement and purity—this is the highest transcendence. The Old Sage says: ‘They cannot be drawn near, nor kept at a distance; they cannot be benefited, nor harmed; they cannot be valued, nor debased—therefore they are honored by the world.’ This precisely reveals the wonder of non-attachment.\n\nFrom the perspective of the work of returning and restoration: when the mind and breath wondrously merge, and one reaches a state of melting softness and numbness, giving rise to various transformations of the *se-yin* (color-karma), the student must not cling to them in the slightest. To be without attachment is to be without danger. The ancients’ solemn warnings to guard against peril and consider risk were precisely to prevent one from being unable to relinquish the body and forget form.\n\n**18. Heaven and Humanity Emit Together**\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: ‘Heaven and humanity emit together; the myriad transformations establish their foundation.’ This is the transmission handed down in the Zhong-Lü lineage; what my late teacher imparted to me was likewise. For ten thousand generations to come, the practice of the Mysterious School will be no different. Thus these two lines truly constitute the esoteric purport passed down in an unbroken thread—the essential principle of the Three Passes in the cultivation of truth.\n\nOne asks: ‘What is *heaven and humanity emitting together*?’ The answer: ‘The firing process applied outside the body is the natural operation of *you-zuo-you-wei* (having action and intention).’\n\nOne asks: ‘What is *the myriad transformations establishing their foundation*?’ The answer: ‘All verifications appearing in the physical body are the natural operation of *wu-zuo-wu-wei* (having no action and no intention).’\n\nYet if one fails to awaken to the *one touch* outside the body, there is only humanity without heaven—thus it is difficult to realize the wonder of heaven and humanity emitting together. It is like a marionette on stage: only when the strings outside the body are manipulated in concert does the marionette’s bearing and movement become perfectly wondrous. The elixir method is the same: all firing processes occur in the empty space outside the body (that is, the *wai xuan guan*, the gate of total holding), while all transformations and all dharmic verifications manifest in the physical body. This is the essential wonder of dual cultivation of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), and of heaven and humanity emitting together.\n\nIn the *General Explanation* of the *Three Teachings in One* by my late teacher, it is said: ‘In sum, the Great Way of the Golden Elixir—from the very beginning of refining the self and laying the foundation, through the stages of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally, the Greater and Lesser Celestial Cycles, each step, each procedure, each firing process, each transformation—all belong to the *one touch* in the empty space outside the body. If even a trace of intention clings to the postnatal physical body, it is “off by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form.” Once the *one touch* outside the body is complete, the physical body becomes that of a youth. This is because it is a method of cultivating the Dharma-body while also cultivating the physical body—hence it is called dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. Proceeding further to refine the form in true emptiness, one will ascend in broad daylight. Wondrous indeed! Can you awaken to this?’”\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: “The cosmos lies within the hand, and the myriad transformations arise from the body.” If one can comprehend the *one touch* outside the body, then one understands that the cosmos lies within the hand. Having grasped that “the cosmos lies within the hand,” one naturally knows that “the myriad transformations arise from the body.” What is there to marvel at in this? One must recognize that dual cultivation is two matters, not one—hence it is also said: “Heaven and humanity unite in inception, and the myriad transformations establish their foundation.” Can these be distinguished?\n\nI say: The wondrous key to the union of heaven and humanity lies precisely in recognizing the *one touch* outside the body. *Journey to the West* calls this “Grandfather Sun” (a homophone for *gong* outside the body). The ancient sages termed it: “The nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.” Thus, if one begins at the “nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth,” then “one precedes heaven, and heaven does not oppose it”—how difficult could it be to transcend heaven and earth? By returning the yin and yang of one’s body (the heart and breath) to the emptiness of the void and reverting to the state before parents gave birth, the body and mind merge with the Great Void. The true yang within the Great Void comes unbidden; true water and true fire meet without expectation; the qi advances and retreats without deliberate movement. When the water and fire of *xing* and *ming* fuse, the numinous elixir forms without conscious effort—this is the subtle mechanism of grasping the essential, the secret wonder that accords with heaven and responds to humanity. How could mere fixation on the postnatal physical body, with visualization and circulation confined within, compare to this?\n\nThus, those who unite heaven and humanity operate within two layers of heaven and earth, four aspects of yin and yang, employing an inverted wondrous function beyond the ken of the common world.\n\n---\n\n**19. Non-Duality of Self and Other (I)**\nIn the esoteric tradition of cultivation, self and other are non-dual, form and emptiness are one. At its ultimate, form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. When first beginning, one must embody the *one touch* in the empty space outside the body, placing one’s heart and breath in mutual reliance beyond the self. With prolonged reliance, they naturally dissolve and unite with the void. When spirit and qi stabilize within the void, the physical body also naturally becomes empty. With inner and outer both empty, this resonance elicits that response, and the primordial qi of the prior heaven comes to the body, entering into mutual interpenetration. This is the wonder Lu Zu described as: “mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.” The primordial yang of the prior heaven embraces my Dharma-body and nourishes my physical body. Both form and Dharma are cultivated—*xing* and *ming* are dually refined. In this single moment of effort, one truly seizes a year’s worth of creation. Thus, the method of the true emptiness elixir differs entirely from other schools.\n\n**20. Non-Duality of Self and Other (II)**\nIn the poem *To Li Yuanyang*, Master Sanfeng wrote:\n*“The vastness of heaven and earth, three strums of the zither,\nThe harmony of breath, a single flute.\nTo cultivate transcendence within yin and yang,\nOne must cultivate beyond yin and yang.”*\nThis directly reveals that the mutual reliance of heart and breath must be placed in the empty space outside the body. Reliance is outside the body; stabilization is outside the body—only then does it accord with the wonder of “heaven and humanity uniting in inception.” The phrase “cultivating beyond yin and yang” subtly points to the “one touch in the empty space outside the body.” This is what the ancient sages called “the nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.” Alchemical texts dare not state it plainly, instead using terms like *that place*, *the other family*, or *that household* as substitutes. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: “Recognize the deathless method of the other family.” Qianxu’s *Jindan Jiuzheng Pian* states: “The essence of the prior heaven accumulates within me; the qi of the prior heaven is drawn from the other.” It also says: “I have examined ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, and all speak of the great medicine of longevity as formed from the true yi qi of the prior heaven. Where does this qi come from? They invariably say: from *that place*. Yet within our human body, is there truly no such qi, that we must seek it from *that place*? Those who believe are few, while those who doubt are many.” Alchemical texts are profoundly esoteric and difficult to read. Yet if one understands the “one touch in the empty space outside the body,” then all symbolic language can be effortlessly resolved.\n\nFor the Dao of the golden elixir is formed by the union of the absolute void and the relative yin and yang. The void is the mother of the elixir, the Supreme Ultimate; yin and yang are the heart and breath, spirit and qi, the Two Modes. When the three return to the one, reversing the flow, one becomes an immortal.\n\nMoreover, the void is the image of the prior-heaven Qian and Kun; the heart and breath are the image of the postnatal Kan and Li. By placing one’s heart and breath into the external void to rely upon it, and with prolonged reliance dissolving all distinctions—no going out, no coming in, no departure, no arrival—one returns from the Two Modes to the Supreme Ultimate. When body and mind merge with the void, they can function as the void, returning from the postnatal to the prior heaven. In other words, one’s small heaven and earth are immersed and fused within the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun, thereby seizing the creative power of heaven and earth and uniting the three realms within the body.\n\nFurthermore, the void is the other; the heart and breath are the self. By placing one’s heart and breath into the external void to merge, self and other become non-dual (uniting self and other into one body, one nation). The primordial qi of the prior heaven comes unbidden, arrives without seeking. Thus, the Dao of the golden elixir is entirely a matter of the void—beginning in the empty space outside the body, completing in the empty space outside the body. This is what the ancients called the “profound and mysterious great Dao.” Zhang Ziyang said: “The Dao of the returned elixir is most simple and easy—it is merely this ○.”\n\nLǐ Qīng’ān said: “From ancient times to the present, those who transcend all do so by working within the void.” This may be taken as reference.\n\n**21. Guest and Host in Mutual Illumination**\nLǚ Zu, whose Dharma name is Chúnyáng and style name Dòngbīn, takes the Dharma-body as host and the physical form as guest. To know this single point of the void is to be the master of Chúnyáng, whereupon the four great elements’ illusory composite body naturally retreats to the position of guest and is called “Guest Elder.” Thus, the *Wùzhēn* poem says: “Though he be host and I the guest.” Yet when the work reaches great samādhi, inner and outer become one, form and emptiness are unobstructed, and guest and host interpenetrate, self and other non-dual. Upon reaching this non-dual ground, one may enter the gate of all wonders. Zhāng Zǐqióng said: “Only when refining reaches the point where form and spirit merge in darkness does one know that form is none other than true emptiness.” When guest and host intermingle, one no longer calls it “Guest Elder” but “Returning Elder.” Herein lies the profound mechanism of Dharma concealed within Lǚ Zu’s name.\n\n**22. The Substance and Function of the Mysterious Pass**\nThe three secrets of the elixir method are the Mysterious Pass, the medicinal substances, and the firing times. The Mysterious Pass is the foundation of the elixir. Seek it where the four great elements do not adhere and the five phases do not reach, and you will grasp its purport. This single aperture has substance and function, inner and outer. Here, speaking of the outer Mysterious Pass: ○ is its substance; 一 is its function. When the two harmonize, the Mysterious Pass is established—its symbol being ○丨. Chén Xūbái’s *Guīzhōng Zhǐnán* depicts it thus, and the meaning is the same. Kē Bǎozhēn Shānrén said: “The Mysterious Pass is originally nonexistent; it arises only after spirit and qi intermingle.” This saying is most subtle. For only when spirit and qi intermingle does one enter the Mysterious Pass. I further provide a diagram to supplement Xūbái’s purport: ◎. The left half is the character *lǚ* (吕), signifying the wondrous aperture as mysterious; the right half is the character *huí* (回), signifying the wondrous aperture as harmonious fusion. Here, substance is function, inner is outer, form is Dharma, host is guest—all forged into one mass. Ah! Truly it may be called mysterious.\n\n23. **Illuminating the Mysterious Pass**\n\nLǐ Qīng’ān’s *Zhōnghé Jí* states: “The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—the most profound and essential mechanism. It is not the glabella, nor the fontanelle, nor the navel, nor the bladder, nor the two kidneys, nor the space before the kidneys and behind the navel, nor the midpoint between the kidneys. From the crown of the head to the heels, throughout the four great elements of the body, if you fixate on any single location, you have already missed it. Yet you cannot abandon this body and seek it externally. Thus, the sages merely point to the character *zhōng* (‘center’) to guide others—this ‘center’ is precisely it.\n\nLet me offer an analogy to make this easier to grasp. Consider a marionette: its limbs move in a hundred ways, yet the puppet itself does not move—it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are the mechanism, it is the puppeteer who controls them. Ah! Do you recognize this puppeteer? Cease your doubts, for I shall tell you plainly: the puppet represents this body, the strings represent the Mysterious Pass, and the puppeteer represents the true master. The body’s limbs do not move of their own accord—it is the Mysterious Pass that moves them. Though the Mysterious Pass moves, it is the true master who commands it. If you recognize this moving mechanism, how can you fail to attain immortality?”\n\n**Explanation:** The marionette symbolizes our physical form. The pulling of its strings corresponds to the opening and closing of the breath through the mouth and nose. Yet one must not cling to the physical form, nor entirely detach from it. It is born of the primordial and connects to the postnatal, existing in the space a *cun* beyond the nostrils—where the breath rises and falls. The \"true master\" is *sūnwàigōng* (a pun on \"external work\"), represented by the symbol ○—the void beyond the body, a single point of emptiness.\n\nQīng’ān further states: “Most people mistakenly point to the navel wheel, the glabella, the space between the kidneys, or the area before the kidneys and behind the navel—all these are side doors. The alchemical texts say: ‘The Mysterious Pass is an aperture not found in the four directions, above or below, inside or outside, nor at the center. It is where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere.’”\n\n**Explanation:** The space a *cun* beyond the nostrils—is this not where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere? Within it lies the mechanism of opening and closing—is this not the Gate of the Mysterious Female? Thus, the Mysterious Pass is a single aperture of emptiness. Born of the primordial and connecting to the postnatal, when used in accord with nature, it makes one ordinary; when reversed, it makes one a sage. The gate of death becomes the gate of life, all rooted in this aperture. The initial practice of the Mysterious School—focusing the spirit and regulating the breath—begins here.\n\n---\n\n24. **Collected Explanations of the Mysterious Pass**\n\nThe Mysterious Pass is the gateway of heart and breath, hence called the “Gate of the Mysterious Female.” It is also known as the Ancestral Aperture, the Central Regulator, the Yellow Court, the Qi Cavity, the Spirit Chamber, the Earthen Cauldron, the Inner Courtyard, the Sea of Qi, the Return-to-Root Aperture, the Gate of Revival, the Gate of *Wù-Jǐ*, the Chamber of *Gēng-Xīn*, the Central Yellow Chamber, the True Unity Point, the Southwest Quarter, the Dragon-Tiger Cavern, the Yellow Dame’s Abode, the Altar of Guarding Unity, the Mansion of the Elixir Origin, the Golden Chamber, and many other names. All refer to the single point of emptiness beyond the body, where our life connects—where the breath rises and falls.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí said: “The gate of my birth, the door of my death,” and rightly so. This section shall extensively cite the sayings of various masters to confirm this, so that scholars may dispel all doubts and no longer mistake any part of the body for the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThe *Lièzǐ*’s “Heavenly Portents” chapter quotes the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: “The Valley Spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth. It endures ceaselessly, yet its use is inexhaustible.” This passage is also found in Laozi’s *Dàodéjīng*. Thus, the term “Mysterious Female” was first proclaimed by the Yellow Emperor, expounded by the Sage Laozi, and revered by alchemical texts through the ages—its origins are ancient.\n\n**Explanation:** *Xuán* represents Heaven, *pìn* represents Earth, and *mén* (gate) represents emptiness. Above is Heaven, below is Earth, and between them lies a void. Thus, the “Gate of the Mysterious Female” is the Valley of Emptiness. ○ symbolizes the single point of emptiness beyond the body, the center of Heaven and Earth, hence called the “root.” Here, one nurtures the Valley Spirit, regulates the breath to cultivate qi, and applies the fire phases—like the handle of the Dipper, without which the celestial revolution cannot turn. If scholars can unite heart and breath in the center of emptiness, without clinging to the slightest trace of the physical form—existing yet not existing, forgotten yet not forgotten—then, with prolonged practice, they will naturally become firmly bound, harmonious and seamless. This is the work of “enduring ceaselessly, yet its use is inexhaustible.”\n\nFrom ordinary breath, one transforms into true breath. At this stage, the scholar feels as if soaring through clouds and mist, with all eighty-four thousand pores of the body opening. The true yang of Heaven and Earth enters through the pores, suffusing the limbs and bones with indescribable softness and bliss. Thus it is said: “The postnatal breath stirs a gentle wind, awakening the true person’s breathing.” Yet those who do not begin with the “emptiness beyond the body” will never still their ordinary breath, nor attain the state of “returning to the root and reviving life,” nor realize the wonder of “Heaven and humanity united in action.”\n\nWhen spirit and breath settle in the emptiness, primordial qi nourishes the primordial spirit. The spirit, thus nourished by qi, is like a fish in water or flowers and trees bathed in rain and dew—ever more radiant, like a lamp fed with oil, its light growing ever brighter.\n\nExternally, the Valley Spirit; internally, the five viscera—all are steeped in the permeation of the singular qi. Nurtured thus day by day, cultivated and nourished, how could the Valley Spirit perish? Thus Purple Yang’s *Awakening to Reality* states: “To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root. Once true gold returns to the golden chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* elucidates the Mysterious Pass in several passages. The first declares: “Mysterious and again mysterious—gateway of the manifold wonders.” The Mysterious Pass is this aperture, the confluence of Heaven and Earth, the source from which all wonders arise; hence it is called “gateway of the manifold wonders.” Master Tan likewise names it “the gateway of vast qi,” its meaning being one and the same.\n\nThe second passage reads: “Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields. To speak much is to reach exhaustion—better to abide in the center.” In commentary: Heaven and Earth are likened to the Mysterious Female. Heaven is the Mysterious, Earth the Female; between them lies emptiness, void of substance, a circle ○ in form. Is this not the Mysterious Pass? The former phrase describes its essence, the latter its function. The bellows is the smith’s tool for fanning qi. Between Heaven and Earth, a single qi flows, its movement and stillness, expansion and contraction akin to a bellows—within the human, this is breath. Yet in ordinary people, mind and breath do not depend on one another; the bellows moves without restraint, unable to fulfill the subtlety of opening and closing. If one knows to guide qi with spirit, so that spirit and breath interdepend, respiration becoming ceaseless and fine, then the true breath, like a bellows, may summon celestial harmony, nurture life, cast off the mortal coil, and ascend to sagehood—is this not the wondrous function of the immortals? Thus it is said: “To speak much is to reach exhaustion—better to abide in the center.” The center is the Mysterious Pass. What does “abiding” entail? The spirit abides therein, meaning spirit and breath interdepend without parting. The Confucian “attaining central harmony,” the Buddhist “returning breath to the emptiness of space”—all refer to this same work. The Daoist tradition’s “center” points to the confluence of Heaven and Earth, hence the saying: “The confluence of Heaven and Earth is the true center.”\n\nThe third passage states: “As a thing, the Dao is elusive and evanescent. Elusive, evanescent—yet within it is something. Evanescent, elusive—yet within it is an image. Dim, obscure—yet within it is essence. Its essence is most real, within it is sincerity.” The fourfold repetition of “within” again refers to the Mysterious Pass. Elusiveness and obscurity are the signs of yin and yang in union. Once yin and yang unite, creation arises spontaneously—“an image, a thing, essence, sincerity.” At this, the Mysterious Pass within is fully revealed.\n\nThe fourth passage reads: “A great state lies downstream, the confluence of all under Heaven, the female of all under Heaven. The female ever overcomes the male through stillness, through stillness assuming the lower position.” In commentary: “A great state lies downstream” is a metaphor, meaning the male assumes the lower position, the spirit enters the qi cavern, descending to unite with the breath. “The confluence of all under Heaven” directly points to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. The female is the image of emptiness and stillness; through emptiness and softness, the breath unites with the spirit, cherishing and embracing it, unwilling to part. When spirit and breath harmonize, Heaven and Earth commune in peace, and the foundation of the elixir may be laid. Master Hanxu states: “This aperture lies at the center, hence it is called the confluence of all under Heaven. Within it is the Way of softness, hence it is called the female of all under Heaven. To speak of the female Way is to include the Mysterious Way. Thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is one Heaven, one Earth; one firm, one yielding. Without this, spirit and qi would remain robust yet antagonistic, ever at odds and ever apart. Therefore, the male descends to the female, the spirit descends to the qi, inverting their positions to unite, yin and yang coupling. Only then do spirit and qi meet, and the root is established.” This deeply accords with the passage’s profound meaning.\n\nThough the *Zhuangzi* does not mention the Mysterious Female, it speaks of “the pivot attaining the center of the ring, thereby entrusting the center to the nurturing of the ring.” These two instances of “center” are the same as the “abiding in the center” of the Old Sage. The “center” in the *Scripture of Salvation*’s “center regulates the five qi” likewise refers to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. The phrase “center of the ring” is most apt, depicting the ring as endless. The center of the ring, being empty and void, is it not the image of the round emptiness ○?\n\nAfter the *Zhuangzi*, the most skillful in discoursing on the Mysterious Pass is surely Master Boyang’s *Kinship of the Three*. It states: “Square and round, a span in diameter, blending and constraining one another. Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted. Flanked by walls and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle.” This is a most exhaustive description. In commentary: “Square and round, a span in diameter” refers to the space a span beyond the nostrils, the locus of a compass’s sweep, where the movement of inhalation and exhalation resides. “Blending and constraining one another” means it is indistinct yet holds the mechanism of transformation; the prior and posterior heavens converge here. “Born before Heaven and Earth” clarifies that before Heaven and Earth existed, this aperture ○ already was. Thus it is evident that the Mysterious Pass cannot be sought in the physical body. For within the physical body, from crown to heel, all is of the posterior heaven. One must seek it at the inception of the nameless Heaven and Earth to attain it. “Majestic and exalted” extols its natural nobility, untouched by effort, unmarred by carving, incomparable to mundane things. The lines “flanked by walls and gates” and “resembling Penglai’s isle” borrow the celestial spirit-chamber for analogy—scholars must not cling rigidly to the image.\n\nThe *Kinship* further states: “When the upper is closed, it is called ‘being’; when the lower is closed, it is called ‘non-being.’”\n\n\"Non-being serves the above; above dwells the divine luminosity.\nThese two apertures follow a principle—even the golden qi mutually accords with them.\"\n\nZhu Yuanyu said: \"The two apertures are the wondrous openings of Kan and Li in their dual operation, what is called the Gate of the Mysterious Female—unknown to the world.\"\n\nI say: When spirit and qi wondrously unite at the Yellow Center, being and non-being intermingle, yin and yang merge, and return to the primordial beginning—this is the secret subtlety of the two apertures’ principle. As Master Zhou said: \"The true of the Wuji, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoin and coagulate.\"\n\nAfter Laozi, those adept at discoursing on the Mysterious Pass must rank Master Ziyang foremost. The *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: \"Within the body there is one aperture (not ‘within the body’ in the usual sense—take heed), called the Mysterious Female. It is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace. Whoever knows this one aperture finds the Winter Solstice therein, the medicinal substances therein, the firing times therein, the bathing therein, the embryo’s formation therein, and the shedding of the body therein. This one aperture has no boundaries, no inside or outside (all this subtly points to the emptiness of space—if sought within the body, how could it lack boundaries?), for it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness (the celestial mechanism laid bare in these four words). Thus it is sought ‘within the body’ (‘within’ is written with such subtlety: neither within the body nor apart from it, only ‘within’ will do), not to be sought elsewhere (clinging to self is false, grasping at other is deluded—only holding to the center comes near).\"\n\nThe *Four Hundred Words* says:\n\"This aperture is no ordinary aperture,\nFormed together by Qian and Kun.\nIt is named the Cavity of Spirit and Qi,\nWithin which lies the essence of Kan and Li.\"\n\nThe commentary explains: \"No ordinary aperture\" means it cannot be sought in the ordinary body—one must know it as an aperture without form or appearance. \"Formed together by Qian and Kun\" means above is Qian, below is Kun, and between them is an empty void, showing this aperture lies at the center of Qian and Kun. As Immortal Ge said: \"Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center, the center in emptiness, vast and open\"—just so. Master Luo Gongyuan said: \"One aperture in the emptiness of heaven and earth, intimate and secret, admitting no wind\"—this too is apt.\n\nBeyond the body lies Qian and Kun; within the body lies Kan and Li. Since it is said \"formed together by Qian and Kun,\" it is clearly formed prior to heaven and not within the body. It is named the Cavity of Spirit and Qi because here breath and heart depend on each other, and here spirit and qi return to their root. As Immortal Ge said: \"Gathered within the Dragon-Tiger aperture\"—just so. \"Within which lies the essence of Kan and Li\" means that upon attaining great stillness, \"medicinal substances arise in the Mysterious Aperture, and firing times emerge from the Yang Crucible.\" This refers to spirit and qi returning to their root: within emptiness, medicinal substances naturally arise. The Mysterious Aperture is the One, the spirit. The medicinal substances are the Two, the transformations. The wondrous workings of the Golden Elixir lie in Kan and Li. The wondrous workings of Kan and Li do not depart from the prior-heaven Taiji.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known to the world;\nDo not mistakenly apply effort to mouth and nose.\nThough you may practice breath control for many years,\nHow can you grasp the Golden Crow and seize the Hare?\"\n\nThis again teaches that the Mysterious Pass cannot be sought by clinging to the physical body. If even mouth and nose are not the place, how much less the space between heart and kidney, between the eyebrows, or an inch and three fen below the navel? In sum, once you fix upon the physical body, you fall into the posterior heaven and are no longer in the Mysterious.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Mysterious Pass is the emptiness outside, why does Master Ziyang say \"seek it within the body\" rather than \"seek it outside the body\"?\n\nI answer: Though this aperture lies outside the body, it is intimately close to the mouth and nose. Within this compass, in a space of a square inch, where breath arises—poised between the physical body and emptiness—lies the body’s central axis, the place where spirit and qi return to their root, the junction of prior and posterior heaven. Hence it is called \"within the body.\" In truth, this aperture does not belong to the physical body, yet it is not entirely divorced from it. To cling to the physical body in seeking it is wrong, but to completely sever the connection is also wrong—the subtlety lies in neither approaching nor departing. Neither adhering to this body nor leaving it, outside the nostrils in the emptiness of space, where the breath moves in and out—like the strings that work a marionette, the master mechanism of the body’s movements—there lies the Mysterious Pass. To say \"seek it outside the body\" might lead deviant practitioners to transfer it onto a woman’s body and engage in all manner of perverse acts, such as the Three Peaks school’s sexual practices. The ancients did not shield themselves but spoke of the \"center.\" They also said: \"Where Qian and Kun unite.\"\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"The center is the great root of the world. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world. When center and harmony are realized, heaven and earth take their proper places, and the ten thousand things are nourished.\" Profound indeed! Profound indeed!\n\nZhang Boduan’s *Awakening to Reality* further states: “I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your birth—returning to the root and reverting to the origin is the Medicine King.” This \"place of birth\" is another name for the Mysterious Pass.\n\nSomeone may ask: What is the \"place of birth\"?\nThe answer: Master Zheng Heyang said:\n*“My body naturally comes from the emptiness,\nMy body naturally returns to the emptiness.\nComing and going within emptiness,\nOne may plant karma’s tree in the void.\nPlant karma’s tree deep with roots and trunk,\nIts branches and vines will block the paths of coming and going.”*\nThis points to the place of one’s birth.\n\nConsider this: with a single breath’s movement outside the nostrils, the marionette collapses—is this not the wondrous pivot of birth? In the final analysis, this aperture in the emptiness can give me life or take it away. Thus the ancients called it the “Gateway of Life and Death.” Elder Zhongli said: “The gate that gives me life is the door that takes it.” This refers to the Mysterious Pass. Ancestor Zhong further said: “To recognize the true locus of the Golden Elixir, work begins where the body has not yet been born.” Zhang Jinghe said: “If you see it before birth, you will surely become a Great Luo Immortal.” Yin Qinghe said: “To know the original true face, a bright wheel shines where the body has not yet been born.” All directly point to the “place of birth” as the single aperture in emptiness.\n\nThus our former teacher said: “If one attains the secret, then working within emptiness is the dual cultivation of essence and life. Apart from emptiness, there is no other path.” This reveals the celestial mechanism in full—something no ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts dare to speak.\n\nAfter Zhang Boduan, the most adept at discussing the Mysterious Pass is Chen Xubai’s *Guidelines for Centering Within*. In his “Diagram of the Mysterious Female,” he states: *“The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the center.”* He further says: *“The Mysterious Female is white as silk floss, continuous as a ring, twelve fen in breadth and length, containing the essence of the entire body.”* He cites *Awakening to Reality* as evidence.\n\nNote: Xubai’s diagram directly illustrates the principle of heart and breath interdependence. Two overlapping circles form a triad, showing heart and breath merging into emptiness. He also wrote *On the Mysterious Female*, saying:\n*“Within the body there is an aperture called the Mysterious Female.\nIt receives qi to give birth and is truly the palace of spirit.\nThe Three Origins gather here without distinction.\nEssence, spirit, hun, and po converge in this cavity—\nthe root of the Golden Elixir’s return,\nthe place where the immortal embryo congeals and the sacred fetus forms.\nThe ancients called it:\nthe stem of the Supreme Ultimate,\nthe handle of the prior heaven,\nthe lineage of the formless,\nthe root of chaos,\nthe valley of the great void,\nthe source of creation,\nthe aperture of returning to the root,\nthe pass of reviving life,\nthe chamber of the One Sovereign,\nthe numinous terrace,\nthe Crimson Palace—\nall refer to the same place.\nYet when sought within the body,\nit is neither mouth nor nose,\nneither heart nor kidney,\nneither liver nor lung,\nneither spleen nor stomach,\nneither the navel wheel nor the coccyx,\nneither the bladder nor the anus,\nneither the cavity between the two kidneys,\nnor the one inch and three fen below the navel,\nneither the Hall of Light (between the eyebrows) nor the Muddy Pellet,\nneither the Pass of Origin nor the Sea of Qi.\nSo where is it?\nThe wondrous secret is called ‘centering within’—\nwith undistracted intent, the immortal embryo is formed.\nAs the *Canticle* says: ‘The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the center.’\nThis is its meaning.\nLaozi said: ‘Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center.’\nIt lies below Qian, above Kun,\nwest of Zhen, east of Dui,\nin the realm where Kan and Li’s water and fire unite.\nAt the very center of the human body’s heaven and earth,\nwhere the eight vessels and nine apertures,\nthe meridians and collaterals converge,\na single aperture hangs suspended like a millet pearl in emptiness.\nIt does not stand by relying on form but exists by embodying the Dao.\nSeemingly present, seemingly absent,\nas if lost, as if preserved,\nwithout inside or outside,\nyet within it lies heaven and earth.\nThe Yellow Center penetrates principle,\nrightly positioned within the body.\nAs the *Book of Documents* says: ‘Only essence, only unity—truly hold fast to the center.’\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* says: ‘Centered in principle, the five qi merge; the hundred spirits are wholly preserved.’\nMaster Cui called it: ‘the passage that links the coccyx and the Muddy Pellet.’\nPure Yang called it: ‘exhaustively seek the place where the body first received qi.’\nZhang Boduan said: ‘I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your birth.’\nIt is where the Upper Origin arises,\nwhere the true breath is established.\nThus Liu Yuchan also called it ‘the place where thoughts arise.’\nIf cultivators of the Elixir do not understand this aperture,\nthe true breath will not abide,\nand the foundation for spiritual transformation will be lacking.\nMoreover, this aperture is born of the prior heaven and connected to the posterior heaven.\nThe two qi of prior and posterior merge into chaos—\ndim and obscure,\nwithin it lies essence;\nflickering and indistinct,\nwithin it lies something.\nYet this something is no ordinary thing,\nthis essence is no ordinary essence.\nHeaven attains it to become clear,\nearth attains it to become tranquil,\nhumans attain it to become numinous.\nMaster Tan said:\n‘The gate of vast qi is how one returns to the root;\nknowing the bag of original spirit is how one conceals its light.\nLike a clam’s inner guard,\nlike a stone’s hidden treasure—\nthis is the chamber of pearls and jade.’\nAll are true principles.\nYet this aperture has no edges or boundaries,\nno inside or outside.\nIf one seeks it through form, appearance, or image,\none commits a grave error.\nThus it is said:\nDo not cling to non-action,\ndo not manifest in activity,\ndo not fixate on visualization,\ndo not attach to preservation.\nThe sages’ models appear in alchemical texts:\nsometimes called ‘a high rise in the mysterious center,\nshaped like Penglai,\nits gate subtly closed,\nwith spirit operating within’;\nsometimes called ‘shaped like a chicken’s egg,\nblack and white supporting each other,\none inch in breadth and length,\nthe beginning of the initial stage,\nenduring through ten months,\nthen breaking free from its womb.’”*\n\n“Or it is described as ‘its white like unbleached silk, its continuity like a ring, one inch and two *fen* in breadth, containing the essence of the entire body.’ This clearly reveals the essentials of the Mysterious Pass and manifests the mechanism of creation and transformation. Yet if scholars do not delve into its mystery or fathom its profundity, when they apply effort, they merely guard it as Penglai, preserve it as a chicken’s egg, or visualize it as linked rings—fixating on such forms and appearances, clinging to existence and activity, and allowing the spirit to fall into delusion—how could this not be a grave error?\n\nOne must understand that the Mysterious Pass, the gateway of the Mysterious Female, is merely the immortals’ casual indication of the foundation of creation and transformation. Yet within it, substance and function, measure and balance, are originally not distinct—just as Qian and Kun model Heaven and Earth, and Li and Kan embody the Sun and Moon.\n\nAs the *Canticle* says:\n‘When chaos intermingles,\nthe root is planted at the outset.\nTending and nurturing the bud,\ncongealing the spirit to form the body.’\nThus the spirit and qi have something to gather,\nand the hun and po do not scatter in disorder.\nTurning the light inward and returning to reflection,\none abides here without fail, even in haste.\n\nA poem says:\nTending the bud in emptiness and nothingness,\none settles the original spirit within.\nBreath comes and goes without interruption,\nand the sacred embryo is perfected, returning to the primordial beginning.\n\nThe purport of the Mysterious Female is fully expounded here.”\n\nThe above passage by Chen Xubai expounding the Mysterious Pass originally comprised over fifteen hundred characters, of which only half are excerpted here, yet the essential purport is already clear. The text first enumerates the various names of the Mysterious Pass, then demonstrates that throughout the body—from the crown above to the coccyx below—none of these loci constitute the true Pass, thereby dispelling the error of externalists who cling to the physical form. Next, it introduces the term \"within the compass\" (*guizhong*), further elaborating the subtlety of the word \"within\" (*zhong*). It states: \"Below Qian and above Kun, east of Dui and west of Zhen\"—a painter’s technique of using clouds to set off the moon, employing the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) to highlight the central, empty position. It further declares: \"It does not rely on form to establish itself but is generated only by embodying the Dao.\" This again points to the empty position, for if it does not rely on form, it clearly does not reside within the body. The Dao is fundamentally empty; the Mysterious Pass embodies the Dao, and thus it, too, is undoubtedly empty. The concluding poem states: \"Tending the bud in emptiness and nothingness\"—directly indicating the empty position. \"One settles the original spirit within\"—showing the spirit congealed in emptiness, harmonizing with the breath. \"Breath comes and goes without interruption\"—demonstrating the interdependence of spirit and breath, refined to natural purity. \"The sacred embryo is perfected, returning to the primordial beginning\"—showing the embryo formed through the union of spirit and breath, with inner and outer both purified, its substance identical to emptiness, marking the moment of \"returning to the root and restoring the mandate.\"\n\nThe text extensively illustrates the symbolic forms of the Mysterious Pass, drawing material from the *Canticle of Unity*. It states: \"Without periphery, without inside or outside\"—citing the preface to the *Four Hundred Words* to subtly indicate the empty position. Xubai’s original text concludes with a detailed exposition on the principles of breath regulation, ending with: \"Yet this aperture, where yang expands and yin contracts, has no fixed form; it opens when intent arrives, and its opening and closing follow their own timing. After a hundred days, the foundation is laid, the qi-mother nurtured, and in the empty chamber, brightness arises—naturally perceived. The Yellow Emperor’s month-long inner contemplation followed this very method.\" This describes the Mysterious Pass of realization. The foregoing discussion pertains to the Mysterious Pass of faith. The Pass of faith relies on a teacher’s guidance; the Pass of realization must be personally verified, like one who drinks water and knows its warmth or coolness—no further instruction is needed.\n\nAfter Chen Xubai, those most adept at discoursing on the Mysterious Pass include Bai Ziqing, Li Qing’an, Zhang Sanfeng, and Li Hanxu. In Qing’an’s *Collection of Central Harmony*, the Mysterious Pass of the Life Cultivation school and that of the Nature Cultivation school are both expounded. The *Song of Nature and Principle* states:\n\"When the Two Modes first divided from the Supreme Ultimate,\nQian stands upright and firm, Kun opens and closes.\nBetween Heaven and Earth lies the Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthe more it moves, the more it emerges; the more it stills, the more it enters.\"\n\nThe *Song of Refining Emptiness* states:\n\"Before the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below.\nAt the center, a point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\neight-sided and flawless, without seam or fissure.\nThough its four boundaries are firmly sealed, it penetrates the undifferentiated—\nthis is the empty center, the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nIf within the non-empty you employ emptiness,\nnaturally it opens and closes in accord with Qian and Kun.\nWhen the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, the work reaches its apex;\nthe spirit exits and enters here.\nExiting and entering, it returns again to emptiness—\nlike a spring thunderclap from level ground.\"\n\nThe *Song of Embracing the One* states:\n\"The valley of emptiness and nothingness is inherently unobstructed;\nthe Mysterious Female’s gate opens and closes of itself.\nWhen the one yang returns, its wonder knows no end;\nthe Four Powers revolve Qian without cease.\"\n\nThe *Hymn to the Dao and Virtue* states:\n\"Opening and closing in accord with Qian and Kun—\nthis is the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nFrom non-being, it enters and exits,\nalone supreme in the Three Realms.\"\n\nAnother poem states:\n\"The valley spirit never dies—this is the Mysterious Female,\nthe very mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing.\nComing and going without cease,\npushing and surging without bound.\nThe white-haired Laozi rides a dragon away;\nthe blue-eyed foreigner mounts a tiger back.\nIf you ask where the work’s fruition is proven—\nthe light of the moon encircles heaven and earth.\"\n\nAnother verse states:\n\"The Mysterious Gate and Female Portal are not hard to know—\ngather body and mind and turn them inward.\nWhen you grasp the principle of the Two Modes’ pushing and surging,\nyou will understand the qi’s coming and going.\nQian and Kun open and close without rest;\nLi and Kan rise and sink, uniting and parting.\nI, Fuan, now make this clear:\nat the point where thought returns, the elixir’s foundation is laid.\"\n\nAnother verse states:\n\"The true and constant Dao is truly not difficult—\nit lies only in the everyday affairs of the present.\nWhen you know Qian and Kun’s opening and closing as one,\nthe two wheels of sun and moon naturally revolve.\nReturning to the root has its aperture for returning to the root;\nrestoring the mandate surely has its gate for restoring the mandate.\nOnce you tread through these two mechanisms,\ntranscending the mundane and surpassing the sacred becomes as effortless as idleness.\"\n\nThe *Song of the Original Dao* states:\n\"If the Mysterious Flow passes through the Mysterious Pass,\ntreading the luminous path to transcendence is truly not difficult.\nIt is merely the star’s tiny aperture—\nyet it deludes people as if separated by ten thousand mountains.\"\n\nThe *Living Methods of the Complete Realization* states:\n\"Refining qi lies in harmonizing and regulating—\nharmonizing the true breath, regulating the true origin.\nLaozi said: ‘The gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous, its use is never forced.’\nIs this not the essence of harmonizing and regulating?\nToday, people point to the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female’s gate—this is incorrect.\nThe Mysterious Female is the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing.\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states:\n‘Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian.\nOne closing and one opening is called change.’\nOne closing and one opening—this is one movement and one stillness,\nwhich is the meaning of Laozi’s ‘its use is never forced.’\"\n\nThe commentary states: The purport of Qing’an’s poems and songs is to guide one to comprehend the mechanism of breathing’s opening and closing in the emptiness beyond the body. Precisely here, mind and breath interdepend, until spirit and breath congeal and harmonize, the breath ceasing its ingress and egress. One becomes supreme in the Three Realms, nature stilled and emotions extinguished—transcending the mundane and surpassing the sacred.\n\nThe study of returning to the root and restoring the mandate lies precisely here—this is the essential teaching of the *Gate of Mystery* in the school of destiny, the true lineage of the profound learning.\n\nLi Qing’an further stated: \"You need only apply effort in the twelve periods of the day and night, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, turning inward to seek. In silence, speech, sight, and hearing—what is this for you? When body and mind become still and settled, and the square inch of the heart is serene and clear, the true and wondrous mechanism will naturally reveal itself.\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: ‘Still and unmoving’—this is the essence of the *Gate of Mystery*; ‘stimulated, it penetrates all’—this is its function. If one takes a tangible, fixed location as the *Gate of Mystery*, no matter how diligent or painstaking the effort, the endeavor will ultimately fail. To point it out directly would risk your disbelief and render it unusable; you must see it for yourself.\"\n\nHe also said: \"The *Gate of Mystery* is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Today’s scholars often cling to the physical form—some say it is the *Cinnabar Field*, others claim the head has nine palaces with the central one as the *Gate of Mystery*; some point to the birth canal as the origin of life, or to the mouth and nose as the *Mysterious Female*—all are mistaken. Yet fixating on the physical form is equally wrong, nor should one seek it outside the body. Why do all the alchemical classics refrain from specifying its exact location? Because it defies description in words or writing, hence it is called the *Gate of Mystery*. Thus, the sages merely inscribed a single character, *zhong* (‘center’), to indicate it. This *zhong* clarifies the *Gate of Mystery*.\n\nThis *zhong* is not the center between inside and outside, nor the center among the four directions or above and below, nor even the center within a center. The Chan school says: ‘Neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil—at just such a moment, what is your original face?’ This is the *zhong* of Chan. The Confucians say: ‘Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called *zhong*’—this is the *zhong* of Confucianism. The Daoists say: ‘Where thoughts do not arise is called *zhong*’—this is the *zhong* of Daoism. These are the *zhong* employed by the Three Teachings.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: ‘Still and unmoving’—this is the essence of *zhong*; ‘stimulated, it penetrates all’—this is its function. Laozi said: ‘Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness; as the myriad things arise, I observe their return.’ The *Book of Changes* says: ‘In *Return*, the heart of Heaven and Earth is revealed.’ Moreover, in the hexagram *Return*, one yang emerges beneath five yin. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises—precisely in this movement lies the *Gate of Mystery*. You need only apply effort in the twelve periods of the day and night, wherever the mind stirs and thoughts arise, and the *Gate of Mystery* will naturally appear.\"\n\nThe above discusses the *Gate of Mystery* as the wondrous clarity of inherent nature, the thorough penetration of the school of self-nature, the supreme Dao of effortless wondrous awakening. Scholars must understand that nature and destiny are originally non-dual. Those who thoroughly realize the emptiness of the nature’s essence manifest their entire being across the ten directions; when nature is understood, destiny is encompassed within it—this is sudden awakening and sudden cultivation. For those who begin with regulating the breath and congealing the spirit, this is the gradual method. The *Gate of Mystery* in the gradual method pertains to the wondrous qi-mechanism of subtle existence, while the *Gate of Mystery* in the sudden method pertains to the nature-essence of true emptiness.\n\nUpon examining the original intent of the *Dao De Jing*, its statement that ‘the valley spirit does not die is the *Mysterious Female*’ also refers to the nature-essence of true emptiness. Master Sanfeng’s *Song of Sitting in Meditation* says:\n*\"At first, when sitting, learn to investigate Chan;\nThis message lies in the Gate of Mystery.\nSecretly and continuously regulate the breath,\nWithin the cauldron, one yin and one yang refine.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Secret Essentials of the Dao* says:\n*\"Observe the Gate of Mystery, regulate the true breath;\nKnowing these two essentials, cultivation is complete.\nWith the primordial spirit, enter the Sea of Qi;\nWhen spirit and qi merge in silence,\nYou attain the first mystery, the true sovereign.\nWith the primordial qi, enter the Yellow Court;\nWhen qi and spirit harmonize in profound stillness,\nYou attain the second mystery, most perfectly luminous.\nOne mystery is wondrous, one mystery is the aperture;\nWith desire, observe the aperture; without desire, observe the wondrous.\nThese two mysteries are the true mechanism,\nDifferent names arising from the same source—who knows?\nTo observe the Gate of Mystery, there is no other method;\nFirst, within the aperture, regulate the true breath.\nWhen spirit is tranquil and qi is still to the utmost,\nThe wondrous naturally emerges from non-arising, revealing the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe ancient immortals often spoke in half-words,\nFearing the leakage of true mechanisms, they did not speak recklessly.\nSome said it has a fixed location in the center,\nOthers said it has no fixed location and must be personally grasped.\nNow, I have spoken it all:\nIt lies between having a fixed location and having none.\nHaving a fixed location is called the aperture; having none is called the wondrous—\nWhat Laozi spoke of as ‘mysterious and again mysterious.’\"*\n\nThese two passages by the immortal master fully reveal the wondrous truth of the *Gate of Mystery* and breath regulation. His statement that \"it lies between having a fixed location and having none\" is the most perfectly rounded expression—none but an immortal master could have uttered it.\n\nA single touch of emptiness has no fixed direction—coming from the east, it is still emptiness; going to the west, it remains this emptiness. Since it has no fixed direction, it is without location. Yet before each person, just beyond the nostrils, within the space of a single breath, at the point where the in-breath and out-breath arise, each possesses a *Gate of Mystery*—this is the fixed aspect. Is this not \"mysterious and again mysterious\"?\n\nA verse says:\n*Having a fixed location yet none, neither identical nor separate.\nObserve the wondrous aperture equally, emptiness and existence both manifest.\nThough without form or appearance, it is not annihilation.\nSought, it cannot be seen; called, it responds.\nSeen, it has no form; heard, it has sound.\nThe treasury of the Tathāgata, the gate of all wonders.*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Poem on Seeking the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The Gate of Mystery is the key path in a single aperture,\nNeither heart nor kidney, most profoundly secluded.\nSearching the bladder or the valley passage is futile labor;\nDo not idly seek in the spleen, stomach, or Mud Pill Palace.\nThe root of spirit and qi is ever elusive,\nWithin the cavern of emptiness, explore carefully (this line reveals the entire mystery).\"*\n\nOriginally, it resides solely in the luminous clarity,\nWhere the elixir is nurtured, one rides the crane in roaming flight.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Poem on Seeking the Gate of Mystery Again* says:\n*\"Like puppets on stage nodding in unison,\nKnow that all is pulled by unseen threads.\nThough pulled by another’s hand,\nWho commands when I am the one pulling?\nIt relies on the Lord’s constant moonlight;\nThus, everywhere becomes refined and free.\nIf you seek the Winter Solstice in elixir refinement,\nYou must seek it in the stillness of the numinous terrace.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *General Discourse on the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The body is Qian and Kun—seek not without.\nThe aperture of empty luminosity is most profoundly secluded.\nTwo or three may be permitted as companions,\nOne or four may likewise share the journey.\nThe Five Earths build the center to foster growth,\nWhere the Xun wind arises, firmness and softness are determined.\nOnce you recognize the wondrous return to the origin,\nWithin the Six-Six Palace, spring and autumn recur.\"*\n\nAccording to the immortal master’s poetic intent, one must depart from the physical form and seek this Gate of Mystery within the cavern of emptiness. *\"Where the Xun wind (wind as breath) arises, firmness and softness are determined\"*—this is precisely the location of the aperture of empty luminosity, the foundation of spirit and qi returning to their root, the wondrous key to reverting to the origin and restoring the primordial. After the body is broken, the original yang within gradually dissipates into the void. Thus, in the pursuit of reversion, one must also seek within the void to return things to their original master. This is why Master Sanfeng teaches to *\"explore carefully within the cavern of emptiness.\"*\n\nMoreover, the physical body is likened to a puppet. The outward and inward breath through the nostrils is compared to the pulling of puppet strings. The void outside the body is likened to the Lord who pulls the strings. This analogy is exceedingly apt (Note: Qing’an’s *Zhonghe Collection* contains this idea, which Master Sanfeng later expounded).\n\nIf I am pulled without awareness, it is because the mechanism of breath lies in another’s hands. Thus, if the mechanism of pulling is fixed, the puppet will collapse. Day and night, breath cannot be self-controlled. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, from old age to death, one never pays heed to this. Conversely, if one comprehends the mechanism of the Gate of Mystery’s opening and closing, then within the void outside the body, spirit guides qi, heart and breath interdepend, and through extreme reliance, they transform. Spirit and breath become settled, neither issuing nor entering, neither departing nor arriving. Thus, mastery lies within oneself, not another, and the root of life may be secured. Therefore, Ancestor Zhong said:\n\n*\"The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death,\nHow many are truly awake? How many truly realize?\nIn the still of night, the iron man reflects:\nLong life and immortality are made by man.\"*\n\nBai Ziqing’s *Secret of the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The Gate of Mystery is the gateway to seeking the mysterious, the mechanism of the wondrous. It has both substance and function. What is meant by substance?\"*\n\nSilent and unmoving.\nWhat is meant by function?\nStirred, it then penetrates all.\n\nThere are moments of stillness.\nAt the first union of spirit and qi, misty and swirling, vast and boundless—this is one barrier, what is called the place where the Four Elements and Five Phases do not adhere.\nAt the moment of spirit and qi’s union, dim and silent, profound and obscure—this is another barrier, what is called the state of no sound, no scent, no inside, no outside.\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, function then emerges—flowing continuously, rising steadily—true qi ascends from the compass’s center. This is yet another barrier, what is called the Mysterious Female where thoughts arise.\nWhen thoughts arise, as if drunk and then sobering, a numinous awareness appears, and sudden realization occurs—this is yet another barrier, what is called the moment when timing arrives and spirit knows.\nAt this time, using numinous awareness as function, like a string pulling a puppet, the mechanism stirs and qi flows, gently pressing past the tailbone—this is yet another barrier, what is called the pivot turning the Dipper’s handle, the very moment of alignment.\nBathing at the Gate of Mao is another barrier.\nSoaring to the Mud Pill Palace is another barrier.\n\nReturning to the root and reviving the mandate, bathing at the Gate of You is yet another barrier.\nGreat rest, great stillness—emptied and forgotten, returning to utmost quiescence—is yet another barrier.\nSuch are the essence and function of the Mysterious Barrier; all the thousands of scriptures and discourses are contained herein.”\n\nPurple Clarity’s *Discourse on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* summarizes the work thus: Taking the mutual dependence of heart and breath, reaching the state of utter stillness and unmoving tranquility as the foundation, one then arises from essence to function—when stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, at the moment when the solitary yang returns. When timing arrives and spirit knows, wondrous function appears before one. Swiftly rousing the wind of Xun to move the fire of Kun, one completes the entire celestial orbit and returns to great quiescence, giving rise to manifold transformations of firing times. Passing through this barrier and then another, the gates of barriers are layered upon layers. One must penetrate each and every one to reach the field of great rest. Speaking of the Mysterious Barrier’s progression, one may thereby glimpse the outline of firing-time transformations.\n\nIn Purple Clarity’s *Discourse on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, his master Chen Niyan states: “Simply abide in serene stillness, where thoughts contain no thoughts, and the work becomes pure, forged into one piece. Silent all day like a hen brooding her eggs, then spirit returns and qi is restored, and naturally the Mysterious Barrier’s aperture appears—vast beyond all bounds, minute within all interiors. This is the gathering of the primordial qi to serve as the mother of the golden elixir. Diligently practice this, and in a short time you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü.”\n\nThis teaching accords precisely with the moment when spirit and qi merge and the Mysterious Barrier appears. In sum, the wondrous union of heart and breath, forged into one piece, serves as the guiding principle for practice.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures: On the Mysterious Barrier’s Single Aperture* states: “The Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture arises from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. It does not reside within the five viscera, six bowels, or anywhere among the limbs and body. Speaking of its name, this barrier is a wondrous mechanism, hence called the Mysterious Barrier. This aperture is the place where the ten thousand methods return to one, solitary and without counterpart, hence called the single aperture. In a single phrase, it is called ‘the Center.’ The ‘Center’ lies in the midst of above and below, yet also does not lie in the midst of above and below, for it is both dead and alive. What is dead? Taking the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field as this Center is dead. What is alive? Concentrating spirit and gathering qi to reveal this Center is alive. Speaking in terms of the dead, it is called the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field. Speaking in terms of the living, it is called the Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture. Thus it is said: ‘Arising from the midst of emptiness and nothingness.’ The true mechanism is laid bare; those who attain it keep it secret.”\n\nCommentary: Master Hanxu’s opening two phrases in this discourse are most direct. Since it is said to “arise from the midst of emptiness and nothingness,” it is clearly not within the physical body. The subsequent text reiterates, “not residing within the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, or hundred vessels.” Yet how laughable that scholars still grope for it within the physical body! “The place where the ten thousand methods return to one” is precisely the single point of emptiness—○—such is its image. It is also said, “solitary and without counterpart,” for emptiness does not belong to yin or yang, being absolute and not relative. This “concentrating spirit and gathering qi to reveal this Center” means forging heart and breath into one piece within emptiness.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Further Discourse on the Mysterious Barrier* states: “The Mysterious Barrier is the numinous radiance of spirit and qi’s union. When first glimpsed, it flickers without constancy. When first entered, it is indistinct and without basis, for spirit and qi have just merged and cannot yet coalesce firmly. Only when their embrace becomes pure and familiar, when the heart dies and does not stray, does one begin to recognize that within the Mysterious Barrier, self and other are forgotten, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it, and it is utterly undifferentiated, steadily soaring. Within this, wondrous transformations are manifold and beyond description. No wonder its names are so numerous. Each person’s perception differs, and each names it according to what they see, designating it by what they employ. Ancient immortals kept it secret and unspoken, requiring the transmission of precepts through the conferral of the master’s touch. Even when they did speak of it, they merely said: ‘It is neither heart nor kidneys.’ I say: It is also not the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field. Now I reveal it further; those who recognize it should keep it secret.”\n\nMoreover, *Direct Pointer to the Character ‘Center’* states: “What is the Center? It is the Mysterious Barrier. The *Triple Concordance* says: ‘In movement, do not lose the Center; in floating, guard the compass’s center.’ Both refer to this. The realm of the Center—from self-nourishment through concentrating spirit, entering the chamber to return the elixir, to the effortless transformation of spirit—all lie within it. Thus, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this Center to have a path of ascent. Formerly, Master Wen Shi asked the Most High: ‘What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the body?’ The Most High replied: ‘It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the Center and embracing the One.’ Further examining the *Concordance*, it says: ‘Closing above is called having; closing below is called lacking.’ I venture to say: These words ‘above’ and ‘below’ are both concealed within the character ‘Center.’ Yin and yang come and go within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between it. Uniting above and below, one enters into its midst. Thus, when above is closed and below is shut, the mechanism is subtle and tight. Within the great emptiness, the primordial qi moves alone, hence called ‘lacking’—this is also the purport of observing the wondrous. When below is closed and above is shut, it is hidden and unseen. Yet within the profound darkness there is essence, and within it there is sincerity, hence called ‘having’—this is also the purport of observing the aperture. Whether above is closed or below is closed, both return within the Mysterious Female. Whether without desire or with desire, all abide within the subtle and mysterious. Thus, the Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture is also called the wondrous aperture of having and lacking, the cauldron of above and below, the furnace of yin and yang, the cavern of spirit and qi—all derive from this, all are subsumed within the single Center.”\n\n“All the above reveals how heart and breath harmonize within emptiness, merging the Three into One to manifest the wondrous function of the Mysterious Barrier. The essence of the Mysterious Barrier is emptiness; within this emptiness, which is not empty, a single qi flows. Thus, when heart and breath interdepend and wondrously unite within it, both essence and function are complete, and the path of return is opened.\n\nEssence resides in the Prenatal, function in the Postnatal. When essence and function unite, Heaven and Humanity merge in simultaneous arising. Flowing countercurrent to return, pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path—what difficulty remains?\n\nThe foregoing briefly discloses the source and origin, as well as the distinction between essence and function, so that scholars may discern the general outline of what the alchemical texts describe. Some speak from the position of faith, others from the position of realization; some expound from the perspective of the Life School, others from the Nature School. As the saying goes, ‘The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom’—it is difficult to generalize.\n\nAs for the poems of past patriarchs praising the ‘Mysterious Barrier,’ they are too numerous to recount. Here, a few dozen are cited to broaden understanding and illuminate the Dao’s subtlety. Personal reflections are also appended to elucidate the authors’ intent, making the meaning of the Mysterious Barrier even clearer.\n\nMaster Zhongli says:\n‘Three thousand six hundred gates of Daoist arts,\nEach gate clings to a single sprout of root.\nWho knows this trifling Mysterious Barrier’s aperture?\nIt lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates.’\n\nPure Yang Ancestor states:\n‘Mysterious Female, Mysterious Female—truly the Mysterious Female!\nNot in the heart, nor in the kidneys.\nSeek the moment of receiving qi at birth’s origin—\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is entirely revealed.’\n\nMaster Yuan’s intent is that all heterodox side paths busy themselves with the colored body. Only this Mysterious Aperture does not belong to form, yet remains not entirely separate from it—neither identical to this body nor apart from it. It is the junction of Prenatal and Postnatal, the pivot where Heaven and Humanity merge in simultaneous arising, unknown to ordinary heterodox paths.\n\nThe phrase ‘this trifling’ is most apt, referring to emptiness—what is called ‘so vast it has no exterior, so minute it has no interior.’ Lüzu’s verse directly instructs one to apprehend the state before birth, the moment of receiving qi, when originally there was nothing. As the *Cantong Qi* says: ‘Carefully consider the end, then contemplate the beginning. The body humans inherit is fundamentally nothingness.’\n\nThus, Lüzu also writes:\n‘The Great Dao abides before the Supreme Ultimate,\nExisting before father and mother gave birth.’\nAnd again:\n‘Few know the truth of my Great Dao—\nThe true Dao must be sought before birth.’\n\nZhang Jinghe says:\n‘The Primal Oneness’ single aperture is Prenatal,\nWithin it, emptiness and the principle of spontaneity.\nIf you perceive it before birth,\nYou will surely become a Great Luo Immortal.’\n\nThis ode is most wondrous, directly instructing one to apprehend the ‘face before birth.’ My late teacher’s *Three Teachings Unified* states: ‘In cultivating the Dao, one cannot depart from the state before birth. If you leave the state before birth, you cannot obtain the Prenatal true yang.’ It also says: ‘You must seek it before birth—only then is it Prenatal, only then is it dual cultivation. This is the crucial first step for those entering the gate.’ In sum, it cannot depart from the emptiness outside the body. If you can begin outside the body, the gate of the Mysterious Female opens, and the purport of dual cultivation is attained.’\n\nLiu Chuxuan says:\n‘The Mysterious Female’s gate is an aperture of emptiness,\nIts rhythm and timing must be constantly nurtured.\nWithin the immortal’s crucible, there is no other medicine—\nBase metals are refined into gold through a hundred smeltings.’\n\nZhao Yuandu says:\n‘The aperture of emptiness-nothingness stands at the center,\nWithout birth or extinction, it is inherently inexhaustible.\nLuminous and numinous, neither form nor non-form,\nVast and obscure, empty yet not empty.’\n\nMaster Ge the Immortal says:\n‘Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,\nThe center within emptiness is most vast.\nGather the Dragon and Tiger within this aperture,\nAnd the mechanism of creation returns to your grasp.’\n\nLuo Gongyuan says:\n‘An aperture of emptiness-nothingness within Heaven and Earth,\nIntimate and secret, impervious to wind.\nIn the indistinct and obscure, without color or image,\nThe true person appears within the precious pearl.’\n\nSima Ziwei says:\n‘The aperture of emptiness-nothingness is called the Mysterious Barrier,\nLocated within the human body’s Heaven and Earth.\nEighty-four thousand divisions above and below,\nNine, three, six, five arranged in cycles.\nVastly encompassing the Dharma-realm, without trace,\nMinute as a speck of dust, without appearance.\nThis is called the ancestral qi’s cavity,\nA grain of millet suspended at the center.’\n\nAll the above poems directly point to ‘emptiness’ as the Mysterious Barrier, their meaning quite evident. Sima Ziwei’s lines, ‘Vastly encompassing the Dharma-realm, minute as a speck of dust,’ are particularly masterful in depicting ‘emptiness.’\n\nTianlaizi says:\n‘The gate of the Mysterious Female remains open all day,\nWithin it, a single aperture blends with the numinous terrace.\nNo gate, no lock, no one to guard it—\nSun and moon, east and west, come and go of themselves.’\n\nChaoyuanzi says:\n‘The Central Peak stands tall, level with sun and moon,\nQian and Kun’s branches and leaves lie in the numinous stream.\nTortoise and Snake move back and forth like twin clouds,\nWind and rain drench a single plot of water.\nWithin the furnace, sovereign and minister are named Zi and Wu,\nWithin the crucible, husband and wife are called East and West.\nFortunately, the medicine of longevity remains here—\nWhy persist in deluding body and mind?’\n\nZhang Hongmeng says:\n‘The root of Heaven and Earth begins with the Mysterious Female,\nInhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, grasping the handle.\nHidden and manifest are both empty—empty yet not empty,\nSeek it and it cannot be seen, call it and it responds.’\n\nWang Chuyi says:\n‘The Valley Spirit establishes the root of Heaven here,\nThe highest sages name it the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nPiercing the worldly people’s life-and-death cavity,\nTrue immortals determine Qian and Kun at this point.’\n\nDing Yehe says:\n‘The Three Teachings’ unity is this perfect circle,\nBorn in non-action, prior to the Image of the Emperor.’”\n\n“When one awakens to this wondrous truth,\nOnly then does one know the ancestral root of the Great Dao.”\n\nMa Danyang says:\n“Laozi’s golden elixir, the Buddha’s pearl—\nPerfectly luminous, lacking nothing, with no excess.\nThe gate of death and door of life stem from this cavity,\nAnd this cavity alone can embrace the Great Void.”\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n“At the center of Heaven and Earth stands the Pass of Hangu,\nWhere sun and moon traverse from west to east.\nPeer through a tiny tube to glimpse the Mysterious Cavity—\nTiger crouched, dragon coiled, its qi majestic and grand.”\n\nXiao Liaozhen says:\n“Laozi clearly opened the gate of all wonders,\nWith each closing and opening responding to Qian and Kun.\nIn the formless realm beyond images,\nLies the root of eternal life without death.”\n\nHe also says:\n“Split open the Mysterious Female to reveal the twin passes,\nWhere refining work is no ordinary task.\nFor scholars seeking the true locus,\nFace the Northern Dipper while gazing south.”\n\nHe further says:\n“Within this tiny gourd lies another heaven,\nWhere an iron ox plows the earth to sow golden lotuses.\nSuch a scene exists in every household—\nWhy then do people of this age not cultivate immortality?”\n\nAnd again:\n“Though small as a gourd,\nIts upper and lower mirror Qian and Kun’s cosmic pattern.\nIf one knows the time and can apply it,\nThe golden crow and jade hare will move from west to east.”\n\nMaster Heshang says:\n“In profound obscurity, the gate of all wonders opens;\nIn fleeting glimpses, the true cavity is preserved.\nGathered, it hides within a single grain;\nReleased, it pervades the six directions.”\n\nGao Xiangxian says:\n“What is the Dao of True Unity?\nFirst, knock upon the gate of Wu and Ji.\nWithin the gate of Wu and Ji lies true water—\nThis true water is the root of the Yellow Sprout.”\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n“Bottomless, it is called the bellows; perforated, the key.\nWithin lies a single cavity—\nNo one has ever touched it.”\n\nShi Xinglin says:\n“One aperture, the Mysterious Pass,\nThe head of the three barriers’ path.\nWith sudden, effortless movement,\nDivine water flows naturally.”\n\nXue Daoguang says:\n“Mysterious indeed the true, female indeed the true—\nMysterious and female both converge in a single cavity,\nNot in mouth or nose, nor heart or kidneys.”\n\nMaster Lü says:\n“At midnight and noon, feast on the essence of sun and moon,\nOpening and closing the gate of the Mysterious Pass.\nEver thus, through life,\nHold fast to yin and yang, refining them with care.”\n\nLu Xixing says:\n“Do not dismiss the Mysterious Female as trivial—\nRecognize the door of life and gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism and reverse the flow,\nYou will instantly transcend life and death, and the Dao will abide.”\n\nMaster Yin says:\n“Boundless and empty is the Mysterious Cavity—\nTo know yet not cling is the true work.”\n\nThe above verses and hymns by these venerable masters elucidate the principles of the Mysterious Pass, each profound in its own right, yet Master Yin’s two lines are the most direct and incisive. The first line defines its essence, revealing the emptiness beyond the body: since it is “boundless and empty,” all within the physical form—upper, middle, and lower elixir fields—being bounded, are not the true locus of the Mysterious Pass. The second line reveals its function: to concentrate the spirit in emptiness, to know the breath’s ebb and flow, to follow its natural course, and with a slight awareness, to let it be—this is the true work of “knowing yet not clinging.” Naturally, heart and breath harmonize; the breath, first short then long, then long then short, gradually becomes subtle and still, until it stands firm of its own accord. Like a leaf skiff, its moorings cut, drifting midstream—this is called entering samadhi, the true breath. All elixir methods are founded upon this. As *Zhuangzi* says: “The spirit born of instability cannot be borne by the Dao.”\n\nXue Daoguang’s poem reads:\n“A muddy snake dances in the well’s depths,\nWhile moonlight at the window illumines plum and pear.\nAt night, chaos shatters to the ground—\nThe ten thousand images vanish without trace.”\n\nChen Chongsu says:\n“At this moment, body and heart merge,\nEqual to the emptiness of space.\nOne no longer knows the body as self, nor self as body,\nNor spirit as qi, nor qi as spirit.\nSuch transformation is not through visualization or effort,\nBut arises naturally, without knowing how.”\n\nI say: This is the essential first step in refining the self and laying the foundation.\n\n---\n\nTwenty-Five: The Inner and Outer Mysterious Passes\nSince the Tang and Song dynasties, countless alchemical texts have expounded the wondrous principles of the Mysterious Pass, yet I have never seen anyone point out the two Mysterious Passes—inner and outer. Since the medicine, furnace, and cauldron are distinguished as inner and outer, it is evident that the Mysterious Pass must also have inner and outer aspects. Here, I will not shirk the risk of disclosure and reveal them further:\n\nWhen heart and breath interdepend in the emptiness outside,\nMerged into one, this is the Outer Mysterious Pass.\nWithin it lies Wu Earth, the root of the Nine Returns.\n“Outside” refers to beyond the physical body.\nWhen the heart and breath outside settle into stillness,\nAnd stillness deepens into profound tranquility,\nWithin the physical body, the same ○ symbol appears.\nThis inner purity, where no thought arises and no intention moves,\nIs the Inner Mysterious Pass.\nWhen the Inner Mysterious Pass manifests,\nThe Four Symbols naturally unite,\nKan and Li naturally merge,\nWater and fire spontaneously achieve harmony,\nThe Five Phases naturally gather,\nAnd the work of the Seven Returns is naturally accomplished.\nWithin it lies Ji Earth.\nWhen inner and outer merge in darkness,\nAnd Wu and Ji Earths fuse,\nThis is the wondrous realm of “mouth to mouth, cavity to cavity”—\nBeyond words or writing, known only through silent accord.\n\nWhen the Outer Mysterious Pass manifests,\nThe entire body naturally softens with bliss,\nIn a state of fleeting obscurity,\nThe primordial qi arrives of its own accord,\nThe medicine spontaneously generates,\nAnd the wondrous effects of the Nine Returns unfold.\nThus, the outer return and inner reversal\nCause true qi to flourish ever more,\nAnd the original spirit to grow ever stronger.\nTrue yin and true yang intertwine,\nDrawing from Kan to fill Li.\n\nWhen the Li Palace is filled and the Yang Pass closes, the colored body reverts to that of a youth.\n\n**26. Inner and Outer Crucibles and Cauldrons**\nThe crucible and cauldron serve to contain the medicine. The distinction between \"inner\" and \"outer\" refers to the inner and outer medicines. The crucible is emptiness; the cauldron is also emptiness. Only emptiness can receive; only emptiness can contain. Thus, the wonder of the crucible and cauldron lies in their emptiness. Alchemical texts speak of the \"crescent-moon crucible,\" the \"cinnabar cauldron,\" or the \"Qian cauldron and Kun crucible,\" the \"golden cauldron and jade crucible,\" as well as the \"radiant cauldron\" and the \"suspended-embryo cauldron\"—all these are mentioned. Yet none have clearly revealed the two inner and outer cauldrons and crucibles. Here, I shall not shirk prolixity but disclose them plainly: the outer crucible and cauldron exist in the state where heart and breath interdepend to form this ○ realm. From this, the outer medicine is produced, accomplishing the work of the Nine Returns. The inner crucible and cauldron require the work to reach the state of great samādhi, where within the colored body true emptiness ○ is achieved. Upon attaining the inner Mysterious Pass, the inner crucible and cauldron are established. Thus, the inner crucible and cauldron pertain to the work of the Seven Returns, the crucible and cauldron used in the union of Kan and Li’s dragon and tiger—this is the principle of nature, the natural state of non-action and non-striving. As Master Ziyang said: *\"Within, there is the natural true fire; in the crucible, it blazes red without end.\"* The outer crucible and cauldron pertain to the work of life, the natural state of action and effort. As Master Ziyang said: *\"The outer crucible requires diligent effort in increasing and decreasing.\"* The outer crucible demands the union of Heaven and human effort, whereupon the inner crucible naturally *\"establishes the foundation of the myriad transformations.\"* This is what is meant by *\"the lodestone draws iron, penetrating barriers unseen.\"*\n\nIn sum, the work values great samādhi, where inner and outer are both purified, both empty. When the state of great samādhi and true emptiness is truly attained, the Wu and Ji Earths naturally merge, and the inner and outer crucibles and cauldrons are complete. Within, the Seven Returns; without, the Nine Returns. From true emptiness, wondrous being manifests; through wondrous being, true emptiness is embraced. Emptiness and being interpenetrate, wondrous apertures are equally perceived, states and wisdom merge, self and other dissolve, host and companion intermingle. Thus, the dharmadhātu becomes the crucible, the six great elements the medicine. Mobilizing the true fire of nature’s emptiness, one refines the dust-like ignorance, transforms the ordinary substance into a numinous body, transcends the leaky to become leakless, emerges from the five aggregates and turns the five turbidities—this is the great mechanism and great function of the Mysterious School.\n\n**27. Inner and Outer Dharma and Resources**\n\"Dharma\" refers to the guidelines of practice; \"resources\" refer to the materials for sustenance. In the cultivation of the Mysterious School’s primordial human perfection, nothing lies beyond the wondrous union of heart and breath, returning to the state before images and the Supreme Emperor, where *\"Heaven and human unite in effort\"* and *\"the foundation of the myriad transformations is established\"*—this is called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Herein, the most essential are the crucible and cauldron, the medicine, and the firing times. Only by thoroughly understanding the two states of prior and posterior Heaven, as well as the two dynamics within and beyond the body, can one enter the chamber and undertake the great work of the Seven Returns and Nine Returns—this is the inner dharma.\n\nOne must also arrange worldly affairs, cast aside distractions, maintain tranquility, and guard the heart from entanglements. The environment should be pure, daily life comfortable, worldly matters and human relations undisturbing. The mind should be at peace, the Daoist aspiration pure. The dwelling should be secluded, free from the sounds of poultry and dogs, the clamor of carriages and horses. Meals should consist of plain, soft, warm vegetarian dishes, with tobacco and alcohol strictly avoided. During practice, the body’s temperature must be carefully maintained—avoid drafts and do not seek coolness. In cold weather, cover with a light blanket; if the pores open, one may catch a cold. For those diligent in practice, frequent small meals are best, and all stimulating foods should be avoided. When walking, move slowly, and guard against anger and lust. If yang hyperactivity arises, one need only borrow a woman’s quilt and sleep for a night or two to resolve it. These aspects of clothing, food, shelter, and movement must be attended to and studied—this is the outer dharma, which supports practice and enhances efficiency. Alchemical texts do not discuss these; they are known through oral transmission from a teacher.\n\nInner resources are the primordial qi. Outer resources are worldly wealth, used to cover the expenses of Daoist cultivation—also called \"Daoist provisions.\" The construction of a cultivation chamber, the purchase of land, and daily expenditures must all be planned in advance. When both inner and outer dharma and resources are complete, practice proceeds without hindrance.\n\n**28. Inner and Outer Companions and Grounds**\n\"Companions\" are fellow practitioners of shared understanding. While one may practice alone at ordinary times, during the days of passing the great celestial orbit, two or three companions are indispensable to keep watch and provide warnings—their responsibility is immense. Inner companions are the heart and breath, stillness and illumination, samādhi and wisdom. In states where body and mind are settled and at peace, one takes emptiness as the Daoist arena and roams within it—this is the inner sitting ground. The alchemical chamber is the outer sitting ground.\n\n**29. Essential Teachings of the Western School**\nMaster Hanxu first encountered Immortal Sanfeng, then Patriarch Lü Chunyang, and synthesized the heart transmissions of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages. After attaining the Dao, he founded the Western School of the Great River. From Master Hanxu, the transmission passed to Master Wu Tianzhi, then to Master Wang—barely fifty or sixty years in all. I studied under Master Wang for four years, during which he repeatedly transmitted the teachings. I came to understand that the essential principle of the Western School’s transmission lies in great samādhi and true emptiness; all other return-and-reversal oral instructions and subtle firing times are but extensions of great samādhi and true emptiness.\n\nAfter examining the records, we find that after receiving the esoteric transmission from Ancestor Zhong, Patriarch Lü built a hermitage in the Zhongnan Mountains to cultivate and refine his practice. Yet his private thoughts remained unsettled, and thrice he approached the furnace without success. Ancestor Zhong said, “The human heart has not yet died, and the firing times lack strictness. You must once more still your mind and enter into great samādhi.” Patriarch Lü then asked, “In the profound obscurity where hun and po intermingle, how can one preserve the integral form?” Ancestor Zhong replied, “When wisdom arises from obscurity and the mind abides in great samādhi, spirit attains tranquility. Once spirit merges into unity, how could it fail to accord with the real? The golden body and jade essence are inherently refined through sincerity. When the great elixir is accomplished, the body becomes weightlessly airborne.”\n\nHe further said, “The myriad things flourish and each returns to its root. They blossom and bear flowers, yet each harms its own authenticity. Born at dawn, withered by dusk—what thing escapes this fate? I must turn inward and reflect: I, too, am a thing. Thus, I delve into the root, gather the numinous, depart from being and return to non-being, and revert to true emptiness. But first, one must eliminate the ten obstacles. For one is scorched by florid ornament, deluded by resonant clamor, nourished by rich delicacies, enveloped in fragrance, shown preferences of like and dislike, habituated to envy and flattery, enslaved by gold and jade, enticed by rank and emolument, seduced by sweet words, and deceived by cunning schemes. If these ten obstacles are not removed, one strays from nature and loses the Dao.”\n\nPatriarch Lü said, “The wondrous treasure is refined not by chance; only when true emptiness is realized does one attain transcendence.” These are all essential principles of great samādhi and true emptiness.\n\nMaster Sanfeng stated, “The matter that lies beyond this is the golden fluid returning elixir, where emotion returns to nature, reaching the state of true emptiness. The great function manifests, the Dragon Maiden offers the pearl, and golden light appears—only then is it a lasting attainment.” He also said, “I merely await the moment to stir the fire and refine true emptiness, seeking the light to break through primordial chaos.” And, “When true emptiness is realized and form vanishes, the dharmakāya abides eternally without falling into emptiness.” Again, “Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial revolution to forge true emptiness and return to the Great Non-being.” And, “Once the golden elixir is refined and true emptiness is realized, the body remains unmoved for thousands of years.” Such is the critical importance of true emptiness.\n\nOnly through great samādhi can one reach the state of true emptiness. Having attained true emptiness, one then accords with wondrous being, where emptiness and being merge perfectly, and form and spirit are both sublime. Thus, the profound principle of great samādhi and true emptiness is the pivotal point of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages, the mysterious essence of the nine returns and seven reversals.\n\nThe principle of great samādhi and true emptiness, though transmitted as the core teaching of the Western School of the Great River, when traced back to the sages of old, in fact originates in the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*. Does not Master Huzhi’s “Great Thoroughfare without trace” refer to true emptiness? Does not Zhuangzi’s “Heaven’s gate opens and closes, yet no form is seen” also refer to true emptiness? Again, “When the cosmos abides in tranquility, radiance issues forth from heaven,” “The Great Oneness flows through it,” “Great samādhi upholds it,” “Without end or beginning, without moment or time”—do these not speak of great samādhi? And when it says, “Abiding in the center of the circle to follow what comes,” does this not mean to remain in quiescent samādhi while manifesting in all conduct, the supreme achievement of sagely cultivation?\n\nThe principle of great samādhi and true emptiness in the Western School inherits the oral transmission of Ancestors Lü and Zhang, and distantly continues the mind-seal of the sages Zhuang and Lie. It synthesizes the great accomplishments of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages and accords with the Buddha’s mind-essence of “true mark without mark, the treasury of the true Dharma-eye.” It may be called the gate where Chan and Dao are not two.\n\n**30. Mind and Breath Interdependent**\nHaving understood the principle of “emptiness beyond the body,” one may proceed to practice. The work fundamentally consists of mind and breath interdependent, spirit and qi united, all projected outward. However, there are direct and indirect methods according to the teachings.\n\nThe indirect method, being subtly empty and wondrously quiescent, is difficult to grasp in form and thus more suitable for beginners. It involves using the ears to listen to the incoming and outgoing breath, which moves within the external emptiness (the emptiness outside the nostrils). If one can hear it without attaching to the physical body, this is the practice. Here, the mind is entrusted to the ears, the ears to the breath, and one reverses hearing to hear the breath itself, thereby making mind and breath interdependent. The practitioner should first engage in a month of quiet sitting to settle the mind, after which one may reverse hearing without clinging to the physical body, naturally entering the wondrous state.\n\nThe direct method places the spirit directly in the external emptiness (the emptiness outside the nose), where the breath’s coming and going is naturally known. The alchemical texts call this “settling the spirit in the ancestral aperture” or “congealing the spirit into the qi cavern” (both referring to the space about an inch outside the nostrils). When the spirit enters the qi cavern, the breath naturally harmonizes with it. The *Cantong Qi* says, “The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center,” illustrating the method of “direct interdependence.” *Zhuangzi* says, “In the midst of no sound, one alone hears harmony,” which is the method of “reversing hearing to hear the breath itself.”\n\nWhen mind and breath harmonize and merge, in the stillness one naturally hears the in-and-out movement—this is called “hearing harmony,” illustrating the method of “indirect interdependence.” In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong’s golden cudgel is stored nowhere else but in his ear, and when needed, he draws it out. This also illustrates the wondrous truth of “reversing hearing to hear the breath itself,” the method of indirect interdependence. The golden cudgel symbolizes the dynamic mechanism of the in-and-out breath. By using the ear’s root to illumine the breath, one harmonizes mind with breath and fuses spirit with qi, attaining the state of “returning to life and reverting to the root.” This is the unity of Sun Wukong’s essence and function. ○丨\n\nThus stored within the ear, it subtly reveals the essence of breath regulation, employing the ear’s root as its function. According to the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, Avalokiteśvara’s illusion-like *śravaṇa* (hearing) and *vāsanā* (permeation) samādhi embodies the principle of “reversing hearing to hear one’s own nature, whereby nature fulfills the supreme Dao.” In the esoteric tradition of cultivation, this becomes “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath,” where both breath and thought dissolve as the entry point. From this, one attains true samādhi; from samādhi, wisdom arises; from wisdom, delusions are subdued—this is what is meant by “returning to the origin, where nature is non-dual, though expedient means are manifold.”\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s discourse on “hearing harmony” and *Journey to the West*’s imagery of “storing the cudgel” both point to the wondrous secret of “mind and breath interdependence.” How could one know the practice of “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” otherwise? The esoteric method of cultivation involves projecting one’s mind and breath outward into the vast emptiness. Emptiness represents the great heaven and earth, the primordial Qian and Kun. Mind and breath represent the small heaven and earth, the postnatal Kan and Li. Placing mind and breath within emptiness to interdepend is the union of “twofold heaven and earth, fourfold yin and yang”—what is called “heaven and human conjoined in activation.”\n\nMaster Lü (Lü Dongbin) said:\n*“Who can match the twofold heaven and earth?\nI arrange the fourfold yin and yang.”*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*“The four trigrams of Qian and Kun serve as bellows,\nCovering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang.”*\nThis describes the very work of this stage. Through interdependence, breath and thought gradually dissolve and transform, ultimately returning to emptiness. Laozi called this “returning to the root and reverting to life, attaining emptiness and abiding in stillness.” *Zhuangzi* termed it “learning the chaos” or “fasting of the mind.” All sages, in succession, regarded this as the essential practice.\n\nThis method of “mind and breath interdependence” was anciently called the “sun-moon conjoining method,” for the character *dan* (elixir) symbolizes the union of sun and moon. In *The Marvelous Encounter at Sea and Mountain*, when Master Zhongli Quan received the prophecy from the Bitter Bamboo True Lord, it was said: *“Hereafter, one with two mouths shall be your disciple”* (referring to Lü Dongbin). *“When you find this person, transmit to him my sun-moon conjoining method.”* An ancient song says:\n*“The sun moves into the bright moon—\nThis is the immortal’s initial work.”*\n\nMaster Zhongli’s song declares:\n*“The southern star shifts to the northern star’s place,\nThe golden crow flies into the jade toad’s palace.”*\n\nIn later times, it was expressed as:\n*“Congeal spirit into the qi cavity,”*\nor\n*“Settle spirit in the ancestral aperture.”*\nYet all these phrases are veiled; without an enlightened teacher, how could one begin? Thus, Master Ziyang (Zhang Boduan) wrote in the *Wuzhen Pian*:\n*“Only because the alchemical classics lack oral instructions,\nWhere can you form the sacred embryo?”*\n\nThe ancients said: *“The Daoist rides the ox backward.”* This also symbolizes mind and breath interdependence, reversing breath to merge with emptiness. Chen Xubai’s *Guidelines for Abiding Within* encapsulates the entire path in the four characters “mind and breath interdependence,” which is profoundly wondrous.\n\n“Reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” is the most marvelous expedient for entering the Dao. Since breath arises from the mind, it is originally the mind’s wind-phase. Reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath, spirit settles and breath follows; breath empties and mind follows. What was once moving is gathered into stillness. Stillness giving rise to movement is the return of the first yang—precisely the manifestation of being within non-being, where timing and spirit coincide.\n\nIn learning the Dao, one must empty the dusty realm and be unburdened by external things to attain its benefits. To empty the dusty realm, one must first empty the mind’s realm. “Mind and breath interdependence” is the wondrous method for emptying the mind’s realm: projecting the mind outward to follow the breath, which empties itself without effort. The jade flute of Zi Jin (Wangzi Qiao) and the bamboo flute of Xiao Shi both symbolize “mind and breath interdependence.” The *Wisdom Sword Song* of Li Daochun, the Daoist sword of Lü Dongbin, and the sharp-edged sword of Master Zhang Sanfeng all represent this same principle.\n\nReversing hearing to hear one’s own breath, hearing ceases at the breath, not grasping the five external dusts—this is “wondrous cessation.” The in-and-out movement of breath is naturally known by the mind; knowing yet abiding in stillness is “wondrous contemplation.” Spirit is wondrous emptiness; breath is wondrous being. When spirit and breath harmonize and congeal into oneness, this is “wondrous center.” Thus, “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” encompasses the three contemplations, merging clarity and stillness, uniting cessation and contemplation. Entering the Dao through this method is most simple and wondrous.\n\n*“The valley spirit does not die—\nThis is called the mysterious female.”*\nValley and spirit, mysterious and female—both pair being and non-being, yin and yang, subtly revealing the secret of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\n*“Abiding continuously as if present,\nIts use is never forced.”*\nThis is the method of neither forgetting nor aiding, where opening and closing arise naturally, evenly and gently, merging into oneness.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*“When harmonized, they follow.”*\nThese four characters perfectly capture the wondrousness of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\n*“Abiding continuously as if present,\nIts use is never forced.”*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Concentrate qi to attain suppleness,\nEmbrace the One without separation.”*\nThis is Laozi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Hearing no sound, attuned to harmony,\nTrue breath reaches the heels.”*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Riding the wind (breath), treading emptiness,\nMind congeals, form dissolves (entering samādhi),\nBone and flesh fuse in harmony.”*\nThis is Liezi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit,\nSpirit unites with non-being.”*\nThis is Master Kangcang’s (Laozi’s disciple) method of breath regulation.\n\nIn ancient Daoist cultivation, one begins with breath regulation—this can be trusted. The interdependence of mind and breath is the non-dual gateway of the Mysterious School, through which one attains the state where body and mind are one, waking and sleeping are undivided.\n\nWhen spirit is released outward, following the breath with ease, and I merely observe with subtle awareness—this is the Mysterious School’s \"observing self-so.\" When spirit is released outward, following the breath’s ebb and flow, naturally merging with the body—this is the Mysterious School’s \"Tathāgatagarbha.\" With prolonged practice, mind and breath are both forgotten, and one effortlessly enters samādhi. After long abiding in samādhi, profound stillness arises—this is the Mysterious School’s \"Ocean of Quiescence.\"\n\nTurning the ear to listen inwardly to the breath’s ingress and egress, then hearing merges with the breath, and the breath dissolves into nothingness—this is the Mysterious School’s practice of entering *samādhi* through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation. In true samādhi, the breath naturally ceases its movement. If even a subtle breath remains, it is not true samādhi. In true samādhi, thoughts naturally cease arising and vanishing. If even a trace of arising or vanishing remains, it is not true samādhi.\n\nWhen mind and breath interdepend in emptiness, still yet not nonexistent, moving yet not substantial—this is the wondrous functioning of true suchness. Moreover, when mind and breath interdepend in emptiness, stillness and illumination are inseparable, tranquility and wisdom nurture each other—this is the equal cultivation of samādhi and prajñā.\n\nThe interdependence of mind and breath is a scroll of the wordless true sutra, a most wondrous *huatou*. The interdependence of mind and breath is the moon-in-water *dāochǎng*, the harmony of *sānmèi*, the liberation of dwelling in illusion. The interdependence of mind and breath is a seamless pagoda, an empty king’s hall, a rootless tree. The interdependence of mind and breath is the Mysterious School’s staff, the Mysterious School’s Vajra King’s sword.\n\nHan Qingfu’s poem says:\n*“Silently holding a stringless lute,\nGently blowing a holeless flute.\nOne pluck and heaven and earth clear,\nOne blow and heaven and earth vast.\nOne blow and one pluck,\nAll are celestial melodies.”*\nThis illustrates the image of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s poem says:\n*“The vast cosmos, a lute played thrice,\nBreath harmonized, a single flute.\nTo transcend the world through yin and yang,\nOne must cultivate beyond yin and yang.”*\nIn these four lines, the first two depict “mind and breath interdependence,” while the latter two point to the “emptiness beyond the body.”\n\nConcentrating spirit in emptiness to attain samādhi is called “sitting within the chamber of spirit”—the sublime essence of the Mysterious School’s seated meditation. Moreover, concentrating spirit in emptiness without clinging to the physical form is the Mysterious School’s “unbroken worldly appearance” form of renunciation.\n\nThe alchemical tradition takes the “wondrous union of mind and breath” as its crucible and furnace. The locus of this wondrous union is the external emptiness, termed the “Mysterious Aperture.” *The Pointers to the Nature and Life* states: *“Boundless emptiness is the Mysterious Aperture; knowing yet not fixating is the practice.”* This can be verified.\n\nZhou Dunyi’s *Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity* says: *“The true of the Limitless, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously unite and congeal.”* This “wondrous union” is the Dao of inner alchemy. “Wondrously unite and congeal” is what Li Daochun called “mind and breath interdepend to form the sacred embryo.”\n\nThrough the wondrous union and congealment of mind and breath, the internal and external qi mechanisms are all pacified—this is the sublime essence of Master Hu’s “balancing the qi mechanism.” Entering great samādhi through this is the practice of Zhuangzi’s “resting in the great equilibrium.”\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* reveals the six great elements—earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness—pervading and containing all. In the Mysterious School’s cultivation, mind uniting with breath is the “consciousness great” merging with the “wind great.” Breath uniting with emptiness is the “wind great” returning to the “space great.” When the nature of space is perfectly luminous, one attains liberation in dharma, consciousness transforms into wisdom, and the patience of non-arising is realized.\n\nBai Yuchan said: *“A word or half a phrase penetrates the mystery—what need for thousands of volumes of alchemical texts?”* Ancestor Zhong said: *“A few words, half a phrase, no many characters—ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures distilled into one phrase.”* He also said: *“One secret reveals matters beyond heaven; all side doors vanish without a trace.”* All refer to the oral instructions of mind and breath interdependence.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“Thus, the method of the Great Elixir is most simple and easy. Even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, immediately transcend to the realm of sages.”* Master Qianxu said: *“The ancient immortals’ alchemical methods number no less than a thousand scrolls. Reading them only brings more confusion and difficulty; awakening reveals their utmost simplicity and ease.”* Master Sanfeng said: *“The work of returning the elixir is most simple and easy.”* Chen Cuixu said: *“It is precisely because of the simplicity and wondrousness of the celestial mechanism that it is scattered throughout alchemical texts yet never revealed.”* This “simplicity” is nothing other than inwardly hearing one’s own breath and the interdependence of mind and breath.\n\nThe wise and the foolish alike all possess this mind, all possess this breath, all can inwardly hear, and all can attain realization. Thus, Confucius said: *“Even the ignorant among husbands and wives can understand it; even the unworthy among husbands and wives can practice it.”* It is the most universal and easily cultivated method.\n\nIn the past, by karmic conditions, I encountered Master Wang, who pointed out this method of mind and breath interdependence. Only then did I know that the Mysterious School indeed possesses a true transmission. Now, this profound discourse directly reveals the orally transmitted secrets, making public the untransmitted secrets of four thousand years. It is because I cannot bear the Dao’s obscurity and silence that I wish to share this with those who love the Dao, to cultivate and realize together, attaining the benefits of body-mind peace and the effects of prolonging life and extending longevity!\n\n**31. Mind and Breath Interdependence (Part Two)**\nThe Mysterious School returns to the Limitless through mind and breath interdependence—this is long established. But what of the Buddhists?\n\nIt may be answered: The Buddhist *Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra*, *Dhyāna Secret Essential Methods Sūtra*, and *Dharmatrāta Dhyāna Sūtra* all expound the principles of breath regulation.\n\nThe Sanskrit term *ānāpāna* translates as \"inhalation and exhalation,\" which is the *ānāpānasmṛti* or \"contemplation of breath-counting.\" This differs slightly from the Daoist method of breath regulation, for the Daoist school’s interdependence of mind and breath does not rely on counting. The Tiantai school’s *Six Subtle Gates* also begins with breath regulation. The Six Subtle Gates are: first, breath-counting; second, breath-following; third, cessation; fourth, contemplation; fifth, return; and sixth, purity. When the mind follows the breath, this is interdependence; when interdependence reaches its limit, it enters samādhi—this is cessation. Within samādhi, wisdom and awareness arise, luminous and undivided—this is contemplation. Gold returns to its nature, reverting to the origin and restoring the primordial—this is return. The six senses become pure, and the realm of wisdom and insight attains wondrous emptiness—this is purity. These may also be harmonized with the Daoist school, though the Daoist path of cultivation and realization most closely aligns with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s principle of \"reversing the breath to empty the space, dissolving the breath to manifest illumination.\"\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, Cūḍapanthaka says: \"The Buddha, pitying my ignorance, taught me to dwell in stillness and regulate my inhalation and exhalation. I observed my breath, tracing its subtlety to its utmost, witnessing its arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing—all phenomena in an instant. My mind suddenly became vast and unobstructed, and I attained arhatship, free from outflows. Seated beneath the Buddha’s seat, I was confirmed as one beyond study. When the Buddha asked about the foremost means of perfect penetration, I testified that reversing the breath to empty the space was supreme.\"\n\nSundarananda says: \"When I first left home to follow the Buddha, though I upheld the precepts, my mind in samādhi remained scattered and unsettled, and I had not attained freedom from outflows. The World-Honored One taught me, along with Kauṇḍinya, to observe the whiteness at the tip of the nose. For twenty-one days, I focused intently and saw the breath issuing from my nostrils like smoke. My body and mind became inwardly luminous, and the world around me turned utterly still and empty, like transparent beryl. The smoke-like breath gradually dissolved, and my nasal breath became white. My mind opened, outflows ceased, and all inhalation and exhalation transformed into radiant light, illuminating the ten directions. I attained arhatship, and the World-Honored One predicted my future attainment of bodhi. When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, I replied that dissolving the breath and allowing illumination to arise—whereby illumination becomes complete and outflows are extinguished—was supreme.\"\n\nNote: The Daoist school reverses the breath from its presence to its absence, entering profound tranquility, which precisely accords with the principles of reversing and dissolving the breath. After profound tranquility, with deeper practice, the light of the mind manifests—this is the sign of illumination. Since the entry point is the same, all effects and verifications naturally do not differ.\n\nTurning to the Confucian school, the *Book of Changes*’ hexagram *Sui* (Following) states in its image and judgment: \"Thunder within the marsh: the image of Following. In correspondence with this, the noble person, toward evening, enters into rest and ceases activity.\" This is Confucius’ method of breath regulation. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; without ceasing, it endures; enduring, it manifests.\" This is Zisi’s method of breath regulation. Mencius says: \"There must be the task, yet do not forget it; rectify the mind without forgetting, yet do not force its growth.\" This is Mencius’ method of breath regulation. Terms such as \"heel-breathing,\" \"restful breathing,\" \"reversed breathing,\" \"spiritual breathing,\" \"embryonic breathing,\" and \"unceasing breathing\" all express the principle of \"interdependence of mind and breath.\"\n\nWhen sound harmonizes with the ear, it is called \"hearing harmony.\" The breath’s ingress and egress are supremely soft and harmonious, and only I can hear it. Shao Yong calls this \"heavenly hearing.\" Lü Dongbin says: \"In stillness, listen to the stringless melody, subtly penetrating the mechanism of creation and transformation.\" Qiu Changchun’s *Song of the Azure Sky* says: \"Leisurely singing the White Snow song within the gourd, quietly tuning the Spring of Yang beyond the world. This music of mine arises naturally, played on a flute without holes, a zither without strings. Awakened, it startles one from the dream of floating life; day and night, its pure sound fills the grotto-heaven.\" These all reveal the wonder of \"hearing harmony,\" the mechanism of \"heavenly hearing,\" and the subtle function of regulating the breath to unite with the spirit.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"The true person of old did not dream when sleeping, was not disturbed when awake, did not relish food, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat.\" This is the verification of the interdependence of mind and breath. \"Deeply\" describes a breath that is long and subtle, unlike the short and coarse breath of ordinary people. \"Heels\" does not refer to the soles of the feet but signifies the mind following the breath, as steps follow one another without separation—each step heels the one before, and the one before heels the one after, following without parting, merging into one. This is precisely the image of the interdependence of mind and breath, continuous and unbroken.\n\nMaster Qianxu says: \"Reaching the heels means the interdependence of mind and breath, returning to their root.\" Chen Xubai says: \"The opening and closing of *qi*’s subtle movements are infinitely wondrous. After a short while, one must forget the breath and unite with the spirit, returning to primordial chaos. When emptiness is taken to its extreme and stillness is upheld with utmost sincerity, the mind does not stir with thoughts, without coming or going, without exiting or entering, abiding in pure tranquility—this is the true person’s breath reaching the heels.\" Master Wang once said: \"Only when one remains in samādhi for two or three hours is it the true person’s breath reaching the heels.\" Though interpretations vary in depth, their ultimate aim is nothing other than prolonged interdependence leading to profound tranquility.\n\n*Zhuangzi* discusses the \"interdependence of mind and breath\" in several passages. The \"Worldly Affairs\" chapter says: \"Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*. The ears’ function is only to hear (the ancient text mistakenly reads 'hearing stops with the ears'), and the mind’s function is only to accord (with the breath).\" The \"Great and Venerable Teacher\" chapter says: \"The true person of old breathed deeply; the true person’s breath reached the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reached only the throat.\" The \"Keeping the Free and Easy\" chapter says: \"I guard the One and abide in harmony.\"\n\nThe *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter says: \"In the midst of soundlessness, one alone hears harmony.\" The *\"Mountain Trees\"* chapter says: \"Now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times, rising and falling—harmony as their measure.\" The *\"Gengsang Chu\"* chapter says: \"To attain stillness, *qi* must be level.\" The *\"Tian Zifang\"* chapter says: \"Now I observe the space between your nostrils—*xuxu* indeed! How does your mind employ itself?\" The two characters *xuxu* depict the harmony and subtlety of the breath, its movement so fine, conveying a state of leisurely ease, serene joy, and unforced contentment—truly sublime beyond compare.\n\n32. **The Samadhi of Harmonious Union (I. The Mysterious Origin)**\nLi Changyuan says: \"Seek only where the true person breathes, and let the alchemical maiden fly to and fro.\" Master Lü says: \"Ride the winds and clouds to their true meeting; seek the phoenix’s secret harmony.\" Master Sanfeng says: \"Though bodies be apart, spirit communes in profound detail—clearly, the two must match in practice.\" These all reveal the esoteric meaning of \"mind and breath in union.\"\n\nMind and breath are heaven’s natural pair, not forged by artifice. In the Mysterious Origin, when mind unites with breath, spirit and *qi* merge in darkness, metal and wood intermingle—this is the samadhi of harmonious union. All alchemical processes—nine returns, seven reversions, the microcosmic and macrocosmic orbits, even the transformation of the embryo and the liberation of spirit—emerge from and return to this samadhi. Yet this samadhi requires entering the wondrous realm of dim obscurity, primordial chaos, and boundless emptiness before true harmonious union is achieved.\n\nThus, Master Guangcheng says: \"The essence of the supreme Dao is dim and obscure; preserve non-being to embrace being, and in an instant it is accomplished.\" Master Heshang says: \"Dim and obscure, it opens the gates of all wonders; vague and indistinct, it guards the true aperture.\" Master Luo Gongyuan says: \"In dim obscurity, without form or image, the true person appears within the jeweled pearl.\" Master Ge the Immortal says: \"It arises in dim obscurity and abides in vagueness.\" Master Lü says: \"Dim and obscure, it gives birth to vagueness; vague and indistinct, it coalesces into a mass.\" The ancient immortals all transcended through this samadhi of harmonious union—truly, this is no deception.\n\nIn worldly unions of men and women, the generative process follows the natural course to produce life. Here, mind and breath interdepend in the wondrous harmony of yin and yang, reversing the flow to attain sagehood. Thus, Master Cuixu says: \"When the tenth month’s jade frost descends, the sacred embryo is complete, and the wind and thunder roar. After a year, the embryo gives birth to a child, who begets grandchildren, and grandchildren beget descendants.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When body and mind unite and grow day by day, one roams within the womb of the Dao and intimately serves the lineage of awakening.\" How wondrous! This samadhi of harmonious union is truly the compassionate vessel across the sea of suffering, the precious raft for ferrying beings to liberation.\n\nIn the *\"Entering the Realm of Reality\"* chapter of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, when Sudhana visits his fifty-third teacher, he encounters the youth Deśa and the maiden Deva residing in a city called the Gate of Wondrous Intent, where they expound the Dharma-gate of Liberation through Illusory Abiding. This, too, conveys the esoteric meaning of mind and breath in union—the samadhi of harmonious union.\n\nObserve that all the spiritual guides Sudhana met earlier appeared alone, but here they form a pair. What else could this represent if not the symbol of one yin and one yang, the interdependence of mind and breath? The \"Gate of Wondrous Intent\" is akin to the Laozi’s \"Gate of All Wonders\" and \"Mysterious Female Gate.\" The character *wondrous* also evokes the image of youthful boy and girl, a word embodying the union of yin and yang.\n\nWhen mind and breath harmonize, there arises a subtle mutual awareness—is this not wondrous intent? Mind follows breath like phoenixes in harmony, a natural union of husband and wife, yet the man does not loosen his robes, nor the woman untie her sash. They revere each other as divine and cherish one another as infants—is this not Illusory Abiding? Thus it is called \"Liberation through Illusory Abiding.\"\n\nUltimately, in great samadhi and true samadhi, there is no coming or going, no exiting or entering. Inner and outer are both forgotten, body and mind utterly still. Empty and quiescent, without reliance—this is called \"Non-Abiding.\" From illusion one attains Non-Abiding, and the work of mysterious cultivation is complete.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Then, after the youth and maiden had expounded their own liberation, by the power of inconceivable roots of goodness, they made Sudhana’s body soft and radiant.\" The commentary explains: *Soft* refers to the state where, through the interdependence of mind and breath, the entire body becomes supple. *Radiant* describes the primordial light and *qi* emanating from the skin, manifesting externally.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"The body generates radiant light, and the *qi* is fragrant as orchids.\" Master Zhongli says: \"Jade nectar flows, moistening and generating luminosity.\" These convey the same meaning.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *\"Song of the Primordial Immortal for Li Yuanyang\"* says: \"The Daoist Yuanyang plays in truth, abandoning office as if it were a worn-out sandal in his quest for the Dao.\"\n\nEight years without a partner, dreaming of solitary roost—\nnight’s chill seeps through the iron pillow, the mandarin-duck quilt grows cold.\nYet behold: the beard and temples have whitened,\nyet in years, the vital spirit still abounds.\n\nI urge you: seek the Yellow Matchmaker early,\ntake a tender wife.\nMan descends, woman ascends—\nKan and Li in perfect inversion.\nMale becomes female,\nharmonizing spirit and *qi*.\nThe celestial maidens of Mount Tiantai’s tender groom,\nOld Man Zhang Guo’s fair bride—\nfair bride, tender groom,\nin the bridal chamber, heaven and earth are forgotten.\nAs natures intermingle, life spans align as one.\nIn the depths of chaos, then shall your true heart be seen;\nin the haze of illusion, then shall your true intent appear.\nThis *Dao*-sentiment is your first step on the immortal’s ladder.\nLaughing heartily, I, Sanfeng the Daoist, dash off these words in passing.\n\n---\n\nThis song depicts the samādhi of harmonious union and the liberation of illusory abiding—its scope is all-encompassing, its divine subtlety unerring; truly, it leaves one in awe.\n\n---\n\n**33. The Samādhi of Harmonious Union (II. Chan School)**\nWhen Layman Pang studied under Chan Master Shitou Xiqian and attained awakening, he presented this verse:\n\n*\"In daily life, no other task—\nonly my own harmonious union.\nEverywhere, no grasping or rejecting,\nin all places, no discord.\nWho distinguishes crimson from purple?\nThe hills and mountains are free of dust.\nMiracles and wondrous function—\nhauling water, carrying firewood.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Mind like circumstances, circumstances like mind—\nneither substantial nor void.\nThe existent is not clung to,\nthe nonexistent is not constrained.\nNot sages or worthies—\nsimply ordinary beings.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Mind like circumstances, circumstances like mind—\ntrue wisdom arises from suchness.\nSamādhi and wisdom adorn equally,\nexpounding the pāramitās far and wide.\"*\n\nThe Daoist school takes the harmonious union of mind and breath as the foundational practice, while the Chan school regards the harmonious union of mind and circumstances as the wondrous proof of the Way. After breaking through the heavy barrier, body, mind, and world dissolve into vast emptiness—all is fused into one realm. Whether form or fragrance, all is the Middle Way. Wielding the staff, holding the tablet—both accord with non-arising. All dharmas are merged into the realm of self-nature, the myriad phenomena like reflections in the ocean’s mirror. Thus it is said: *\"Mind like circumstances, neither substantial nor void.\"*\n\nBaizhang Duan’s verse reads:\n*\"The ape’s cry in the frosty moonlit night,\nthe flower’s smile in the garden of spring’s warmth.\nAmidst the boundless red dust,\neverywhere, old friends.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrousness of the Chan school’s harmonious union. From the harmonious union of mind and breath to the realization of the harmonious union of mind and circumstances, the Daoist and Chan schools are united as one.\n\n---\n\n**34. The Samādhi of Singular Emptiness**\nFrom the interdependence of mind and breath arises the dual stabilization of spirit and breath. With prolonged stabilization, body and mind become profoundly still—inner and outer are both empty. This is called *\"the samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* states:\n*\"The term ‘one’ is like empty space. All myriad things arise and grow within it. When the bodhisattva’s true emptiness manifests, faith and other virtues all flourish.\"*\nThus it is named *\"the samādhi of singular emptiness,\"* also called *\"the samādhi of the singular dharma-realm.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* further states:\n*\"The term ‘one’ is the dharma-realm. The dharma-realm is also empty. Through the power of samādhi, this emptiness manifests—it is called the adorned samādhi of the singular dharma-realm.\"*\n\nThus, the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says:\n*\"Subtle and continuous, as if existing—\nits use is effortless.\"*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s samādhi of harmonious union.\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Spirit enters its gate,\nbones and frame return to their root—\nwhat ‘I’ remains?\"*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Carrying your soul and embracing the One—\ncan you never part from it?\nConcentrating your *qi* to attain suppleness—\ncan you be like a newborn child?\"*\nThis is the ancient sage’s samādhi of harmonious union.\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Return to the root of nothingness,\nreturn to the limitless—\nI alone drift, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled.\nVast and open, like a valley—\nstill, as if nowhere to abide.\"*\nThis is the ancient sage’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Now a dragon, now a snake—\ntransforming with the times.\nNow ascending, now descending—\nharmony as the measure.\"*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"samādhi of harmonious union.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Emerging without origin,\nentering without end—\nin entering and emerging, no form is seen.\nThis is called the Gate of Heaven.\nThe Gate of Heaven is nothingness.\nYet within this nothingness, there is no-thing—\nthe sage abides herein.\"*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe ancient sages first entered the *\"samādhi of harmonious union,\"* then advanced to the *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"* Externally, they relinquished the world; internally, they transcended body and mind. Freed from form, without reliance, they soared beyond the mundane—this is how the Yellow Emperor entered emptiness and communed with Guangcheng, directly realizing the wondrous cultivation of the dharma-nature body.\n\n---\n\n**35. The Stages of Elixir Cultivation**\nIn the Daoist school’s practice, the interdependence of mind and breath is fundamental throughout. Its sequential stages may be divided into three barriers of effort: *\"forgetting form to nurture *qi*, forgetting *qi* to nurture spirit, forgetting spirit to nurture emptiness.\"* The *Guidelines on Nature and Life* adds a fourth stage, *\"refining emptiness to merge with the Dao\"* (more accurately, *\"forgetting emptiness to merge with the Dao\"*), though one must not cling rigidly to these divisions.\n\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n*\"In a single moment of stillness, within that moment lie the efforts of refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness—not only in the ten-month period. This holds true for an hour, a day, a month, or a year. Sitting with eyes closed, concentrating the spirit, calming the mind and regulating the breath—this is the work of refining essence into *qi*. Turning the light inward, focusing the spirit in the elixir field, allowing the true breath to flow—within, stillness reaches its extreme and stirs, movement reaches its extreme and stills. Infinite celestial mechanisms—this is the work of refining *qi* into spirit.\"*\n\nI propose:\n\nThe stages of the elixir Way may be broadly divided into three parts.\n\nThe first is the preliminary practice. At the outset of learning, one employs the method of mind and breath interdependent, so that spirit and *qi* unite externally. Gradually they become harmonious, gradually subtle, gradually faint, passing from indistinct obscurity into the cessation of breathing and the great serenity of perfect samādhi—this is called the preliminary practice. The goal of the preliminary practice is to attain samādhi, for all elixir methods rest upon the foundation of great samādhi.\n\nThe second is the main practice. From the cessation of breathing and the great samādhi of spirit and *qi*, one proceeds to the seven returns and nine reversions, replenishing the primordial, which the elixir texts call the “minor celestial orbit.” Next, once the primordial is replenished, one ceases the fire and coagulates the elixir. Next, one nurtures the elixir. Next, when the elixir is full, one circulates the great celestial orbit. Next, one obtains the great medicine and performs the seven-day work of the great celestial orbit. Next, one embraces the origin and nurtures the embryo. Next, when the embryo is complete, the spirit emerges. Next, one nurses and returns to emptiness, and the transformations of the divided body are all at ease. This is called the main practice. The goal of the main practice is to return to emptiness.\n\nThe third is the final completion of the Way. Function is exhausted and effort forgotten, emptiness is shattered to atoms. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang says in his *Poem of Self-Congratulation*: “Parting with the child who rides the crane away, / Emptiness shattered to atoms, the whole body appears.” This is the message of the final completion. The final step must thoroughly realize one’s own nature and the mind of the First Principle; the elixir texts rarely record it, and one should study the *Śūraṅgama*, *Avataṃsaka*, and *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* to attain it.\n\n36. The Mao-You Bath\nMao and You represent the image of central harmony; the elixir texts liken them to a bath. Bathing means retiring and resting. I have heard from former masters: “Once the work reaches great samādhi, it is bathing and nurturing.” In elixir methods, the interdependence of breath is the martial fire, and breathless samādhi is the civil fire. When the work reaches great samādhi, thoughts are without arising or ceasing, breath without exit or entry, body and mind both still—this is precisely the time for bathing. In the Perfected One of Purple Clarity’s *Secret of the Mysterious Pass*, the bath at the Mao gate is one barrier, and the bath at the You portal is another. Longmeizi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* discusses bathing: “Refining the elixir is originally a year’s work, / But for two months one must halt the work. / When the hare meets the first full moon, cease; / When the cock meets the mid-autumn, end.” This is originally a matter of principle, and students must not cling rigidly to it. Have you not heard Purple Yang’s *Four Hundred Words*? “The firing times are not fixed; / The winter solstice is not at Zi. / As for the bathing method, / Mao and You are also empty comparisons.” The *Cantong qi* says: “Entrust your will to return to emptiness, / Taking non-thought as the constant.” This truly points to the essence of bathing, yet nothing is as direct and straightforward as my teacher’s pointing to the word “samādhi” as bathing. In samādhi, body and mind are both quiescent; within this quiescent samādhi, the primordial yang naturally receives nurturing, and the embryo of the Way naturally grows, without the danger of collapse.\n\n37. The Minor and Major Celestial Orbits\nThe terms “minor celestial orbit” and “major celestial orbit” did not exist before the Tang. When Master Cui wrote the *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* and Master Boyang composed the *Cantong qi*, neither used these terms. They first appeared in texts from the Yuan and Ming dynasties onward. Once these terms existed, various schools took the opportunity to expound upon them.\n\nI hold that the human body is itself a small heaven and earth, where qi and blood circulate in a single day and night as one celestial orbit. Daoist methods take heaven and earth as their model, requiring that this small heaven and earth of my body merge and dissolve into the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun. Only then can one “unite virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, sequence with the four seasons, and auspices and ills with ghosts and spirits,” thereby attaining the opportunity to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood.\n\nIf we now distinguish between them, the terms “minor celestial orbit” and “major celestial orbit” may be explained in three ways:\n\n**First**, the minor celestial orbit is the circulation of qi through the orbit, while the major celestial orbit is the circulation of spirit through the orbit. Yet both the circulation of qi and the circulation of spirit occur within samādhi, differing only in the depth of practice.\n\nWhy so? During the refinement of essence into qi, with my emptiness and quiescence, I summon the external true yang to enter my body. When true yang arrives, the entire body feels soft and supple; from softness it turns to numbness, from numbness it enters a state of primordial chaos, unaware and unknowing, like a living corpse. At this time, my body equals emptiness, my mind equals space—heaven and earth’s emptiness is my emptiness. My small heaven and earth dissolve and merge into the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun. The true yang of all emptiness and the entire dharma-realm nurtures my body, penetrating within and without, from crown to sole.\n\nAs Lü Dongbin said: *“White clouds ascend to the celestial gate; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.”* This is precisely the landscape of qi circulating through the celestial orbit. Master Ge Xuan said: *“The fire of Li excites the sea; the water of Kan ascends to emptiness. Jade fluid irrigates; the bridal chamber streams with tassels. The celestial mechanism is revealed; the myriad sounds cannot compare.”* The *Cantong qi* states: *“Unceasing cultivation brings the qi like clouds and rain, gently as spring rain, fluidly as melting ice. From head it flows to feet, then ultimately ascends again, coming and going through the boundless, suffusing all within.”* Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Song* says: *“Await its single point to return and submit; within the body, the four seasons turn to spring. A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance, each rain renews. All day long, languid as a drunkard, idly guarding the spring within the cave. The body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away, transformed into a mass of pure yang. At this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death, forged into a single whole—the perfected true.”* Longmeizi’s *Poem on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* says: *“Each dawn, golden crucible smoke ascends; qi suffices, the river chariot ascends to heaven. Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand things; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.”* All these describe the methods and verifications of qi circulating through the celestial orbit.\n\nWhen refining qi into spirit, both spirit and breath settle within emptiness. The primordial true yang enters my physical body, circulates once around, and because the master dwells outside, the physical body becomes like an empty house. The spirit then departs the physical body and arrives in emptiness, embracing the master. As spirit settles, qi follows and settles. With spirit and qi both settled for a long time, qi is entirely transformed into spirit, leaving only a single radiant power blazing through emptiness—this is the verification of the embryo’s completion. Entering this gate of great quiescence and illumination, the original nature of emptiness merges with the six great elements. The dharma-nature of the six great elements and my true nature become non-dual, without separation between self and other, with self and things as one. Thereupon, one can enter water and fire, penetrate metal and stone, and manifest all manner of inconceivable spiritual powers—all verifications of spirit circulating through the celestial orbit.\n\nThus, in terms of qi and spirit circulation, there is the distinction between minor and major celestial orbits. The minor celestial orbit is the samādhi of refining essence into qi; the major celestial orbit is the samādhi of refining qi into spirit. This is the first explanation.\n\n**Second**, in terms of the minor and major returns, there is the same circulation of qi, yet again a distinction between minor and major celestial orbits.\n\nWhy so? During the minor return, the body’s interior remains the postnatal Kan and Li. When practice reaches the extreme of emptiness and profound quiescence, one senses the primordial pure yang qi entering the physical body, replenishing the losses incurred after the breaking of the body. Thus, my pure yin senses that pure yang. When the pure yang qi arrives, the entire body feels soft, numb, and throbbing. Each time the whole body experiences this softness and numbness, it receives the steaming of true yang once, completing one minor celestial orbit. Gradually gathering and refining in this way, when qi is sufficient, the fire is stopped, and the body returns to a youthful state. At this time, the Li palace is filled, and the body’s interior has become the Qian trigram, purely primordial. Then, with my Qian yang, I sense the Qian yang in emptiness; the primordial within the body and the primordial outside respond and unite, mutually congealing. This is the major return, combining the two layers of true yin and yang within and without.\n\nAt this stage of practice, the power of samādhi can reach two or three hours or more. Each time one settles into quiescence, sensing the Qian yang outside the body and uniting it with the Qian yang within, this constitutes one major celestial orbit, continuing until the great elixir is completed. Thus, the minor and major celestial orbits derive their names from the minor and major returns. The minor celestial orbit is used in returning from the postnatal to the primordial; the major celestial orbit is used when returning from the primordial to that which precedes the primordial. Though both are quiescence and the same circulation of qi, the depth of practice differs, as do the effects upon the physical body. The minor celestial orbit can only restore hair; the major celestial orbit can restore teeth, blood, even bones, marrow, and pupils, making one entirely new.\n\nThis is the efficacy of the *Book of Changes*’ \"renewing the old and establishing the new.\" The minor celestial orbit is a method for peaceful longevity, while the major celestial orbit is the work of transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—this is the distinction between their depth. Thirdly, they are differentiated by the minor and major heavens and earth. The human body is a minor heaven and earth, while the cosmos outside the body is a major heaven and earth. When the adept’s practice reaches the state of indistinct obscurity, primordial chaos, and profound quiescence, yang arises, and the yang qi surges through the hundred meridians. The primordial harmony circulates internally, ascending to the crown and descending to the heels, the qi flowing in an unbroken cycle. This pertains to the minor heaven and earth of the human body, hence called the minor celestial orbit. If, in the state of indistinct obscurity, one becomes even more vacuous, the entire body softens, numbs, and pulsates—then the eighty-four thousand pores all receive the infusion of the true yang qi from the external cosmos. At this moment of extreme vacuity and profound stillness, one wondrously merges with the Great Void. The physical body has become true emptiness, freely allowing the true yang qi of the Great Void to permeate and harmonize, penetrating both internally and externally, from crown to sole, circulating without obstruction. This pertains to the union with the Great Void of the major heaven and earth, hence called the major celestial orbit.\n\nThus, according to the former explanation, the adept first practices the minor celestial orbit, then the major celestial orbit. According to the latter explanation, the adept first practices the major celestial orbit, then the minor celestial orbit. After completing the minor celestial orbit, one again practices the major celestial orbit, and the task is accomplished. The above three explanations all pertain to theoretical discourse. In actual practice, once the state of great quiescence is attained, externally the heavens and earth unite, and internally Kan and Li merge. The minor and major celestial orbits proceed simultaneously. As it is said: \"The inner elixir returns in harmony with the outer elixir; when the inner is open, the outer must also be open.\"\n\nMaster Cui’s *Mirror for Compounding the Elixir* simply states: \"The prenatal qi, the postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if intoxicated.\" It does not distinguish between minor and major (celestial orbits), yet in truth, both minor and major celestial orbits are already encompassed within, making it most concise. The adept should take heed.\n\nThe secret formula states: \"When heart and breath wondrously unite, embrace virtue and warm harmony. The true qi steams and suffuses, nurturing nature and prolonging life, reestablishing the embryo, and recreating the cosmos. In the mysterious tradition of cultivation and realization, this alone is supreme.\"\n\n**38. Passing the Major Celestial Orbit’s Barriers**\n\nOnce the adept completes the initial work of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\" and receives the cessation of firing instruction, the elixir may be formed. After the elixir is formed and signs manifest, one must nurture the elixir to fullness and then practice the major celestial orbit. This major celestial orbit is distinguished from the initial minor celestial orbit. The initial stage involves returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, using pure yin to attract pure yang. At this juncture, the inner body has already become a Qian entity, and with one’s own Qian yang, one again attracts the Qian yang of the void, uniting the inner and outer layers of the prenatal to achieve the great returning elixir, called the major celestial orbit.\n\nThe practice fundamentally relies on the interdependence of heart and breath, yet at this stage, three to five breaths suffice to attain profound quiescence. In this quiescence, the void is without self, forgetting things, thoughts, the heart, the environment, the internal, and the external. One’s own prenatal void communicates with the void of heaven and earth, allowing natural operation. At the moment of extreme vacuity, the body’s prenatal pure yang true qi naturally surges through the barriers to the crown, ascending along the Governor Vessel—what Ancestor Lü called \"white clouds ascending to the celestial gate.\" It then descends along the Conception Vessel—what Ancestor Lü called \"sweet dew sprinkling Mount Sumeru.\"\n\nThis stage of practice also involves three types of firing, which have been orally transmitted among immortals since ancient times and are not recorded in texts. As *Awakening to Reality* states: \"The契 and论, the scriptures and songs, expound the truth, yet do not commit the firing to writing. To know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysteries, one must discuss them carefully with immortals.\"\n\nAfter practicing for a suitable period, when the lower abdomen feels boiling and the great medicine is about to sprout, there is a seven-day process for passing the major celestial orbit. At this time, the adept must have two or three fellow practitioners as external guardians, retreating to a secluded and tranquil place where no roosters or dogs can be heard. With the external guardians attending to food and drink, keeping watch day and night outside the adept’s body, and remaining vigilant, the adept’s mindfulness remains luminous. When demonic states appear, the adept will not be led astray or encounter mishaps—this is the most crucial point. If external conditions are favorable, one may proceed day and night to complete this great return.\n\nAfter several days of practice, the great medicine naturally arises. This great medicine also has its signs. A poem in *Awakening to Reality* says: \"The divine work of firing is not confined to a single day; a sun-like wheel emerges from the deep pool.\" Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Songs* states: \"All myriad phenomena are not of its kind; a single red light is the ultimate truth. This red light is the spring’s essence, within which, like dust in a bright window, a speck of prenatal medicine hangs—distant as a grape, near as gold.\" Another *Daoist Song of the Rootless Tree* says: \"The rootless tree’s flowers are bright red; pluck all the red flowers, and the tree is empty.\" Master Hanxu’s commentary notes: \"Red is the symbolic form of the great medicine. The immortal master’s *Daoist Songs* and *Song of the Rootless Tree* are both essential works; from them, one can understand this.\" It further states: \"When the red light appears, the flowers are bright red. Once the red flower is obtained, the true medicine is secured. Apart from this red flower, there is no medicine to gather.\" These can be referenced.\n\nAfter the great medicine arises, it also ascends along the Governor Vessel and descends along the Conception Vessel. However, its ascent is extremely slow, requiring several days of work.\n\nWithin these several days, the physical body endures the most unbearable trials, beset by layer upon layer of demonic illusions—all conjured by the discriminating mind. One must urgently employ the contemplation of true emptiness to sweep them away. Only after the great medicine completes one full cycle through the Conception and Governor Vessels does this perilous barrier pass safely. The residual yin of the physical body is then swept clean without remainder, forging an indestructible vajra-body. Thereafter, one need only nurture the embryo in meditative absorption, and the spirit may depart at will.\n\nFor those of superior skill, this great cycle and passage of the barrier may be accomplished within six or seven days after the great medicine arises; those of lesser skill may require eight or nine days. The Master said: \"To achieve ascension, one must reverse the body within seven days. Beyond seven days, one may only attain liberation through the corpse or seated transformation—ascension becomes impossible.\" The Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: \"In all firing times, only this great cycle presents such grave danger. The alchemist must prevail in a single battle, and all under heaven will be settled.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Three Peaks, in his *Discourse on the Verification of Return*, provides the most detailed account of this great cycle and passage of the barrier. He says:\n\n\"To refine this great elixir of dragon and tiger, one must seek seclusion where no cock crows nor dog barks, and where only trusted fellow cultivators are present—no idle persons may approach, lest the primordial spirit be startled and scattered. Previously, I spoke of harmonizing with the world; now, I speak of seclusion. Tempering the self amid the dust, nurturing it in the mountains—this is the moment to enter the chamber and commence the work. To transcend the mundane and enter sagehood is no trifling matter. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, free from all cares, utterly unattached, cutting all ties as with a single blade, forever a stranger to the world, without a trace of regret.\n\nHold emptiness to refine the spirit; guard the void to refine the nature. The five viscera, sinews, bones, qi, and blood of the entire body all transform into azure qi. With single-minded devotion, train the spirit to purity, shaping it to command. As stars revolve and the Dipper turns, it obeys the heart’s every intent, nourished until the body bears no wrinkles, like a spider’s form. When the seven orifices radiate light, shining day and night, and the body becomes as the Great Void—only then is the proper time to seek the Dao of immortality.\n\nThis verification comes when qi is full and spirit complete, when dharma-wealth is vast. Only then may one refine the great elixir, and only then is one truly called an alchemist. When the work is accomplished, the time arrives of its own accord. The seven orifices shine, the three yangs flourish, and the spirit-sword takes form. Seizing the moment when water flows and wind follows, one ignites the fire—thunder roars and lightning flashes—to seize the celestial mechanism. With hands set to work, one captures the true lead beyond the body, marrying the dragon to the tiger, driving the tiger to the dragon.\n\nIf one can gather and cluster without missing the timing, one suddenly draws up the gold from the sea-bottom, opens the spine’s pass, ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, and descends into the Crystal Palace, where it unites with the wood-mercury. In less than half a moment, the clustering is complete, and true fire surges into the four limbs. The entire body’s flesh and bones feel as if scorched by fire or sliced by a blade—most difficult to endure. Even the staunchest hero, at this point, has not a shred of control. One must guard against danger, bathe body and mind, and achieve the harmony of water and fire.\n\nIn an instant, the whole body crackles like roasting beans, bursting open all at once. The body’s qi and blood all coalesce into speaking forms, clamoring in a heap upon the body. Beneath the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the Elixir Well, the right the Stone Spring—this is precisely the Lianquan point, which opens along with the bone meridians. Kidney water surges upward like an external spring, impossible to swallow entirely, its flavor most extraordinary, unlike sugar or honey.\n\nYet the supreme marvel occurs at the moment of tending the furnace and setting hands to work: the earth is about to yield its golden lotus, and heaven hangs its precious dew. Suddenly, a single drop of true mercury descends, piercing the heart with icy clarity. One immediately directs a spark of spirit-fire to follow, clustering it within the Palace of Union. All at once, it resounds like a thousand drums in battle, roars like ten thousand thunders—yet this is merely the transformation of the body’s hundred meridians and qi-blood. Do not be alarmed. One must tread the steps of the Dipper, wield the sword, grasp the seal, and hold the mudra. Here lies the most treacherous point: three revolutions, nine turns, subduing generals and summoning marshals.\n\nIn this vigilance, amidst the void, one may witness dragons and tigers coupling, heaven and earth in harmony, sun and moon exchanging palaces, or the assembly of immortals and buddhas. When the work reaches this stage and all visions manifest, one must not acknowledge them, lest one be ensnared by external demons. Recognizing only the primordial spirit, mercury and lead unite. After three days, the great medicine is born. These three days are the hardest to endure: the entire world becomes a realm of demonic illusions, with wailing spirits on all sides and baleful vapors in every direction. This is precisely the great opening of the barrier. At this juncture, nine out of ten are terrified to death. The heart must harbor no fear, for though one has transformed into a spirit, it remains a yin-spirit. Yin-spirits are most cunning, capable of myriad transformations to inflict harm—they will not submit willingly.\n\nAn ancient adept said it well: ‘Only when you master the six penetrations can you escape birth and death; if you do not master the six penetrations, do not dream of attaining the Dao.’ After thirty hours—two and a half days—of primordial chaos, qi interpenetrates qi, filling to the utmost. Suddenly, a radiant solar pearl bursts forth, lively and free, leaping from its husk into the mouth. A hundred thousand dragon-spirits are struck with awe. This is the primordial yang elixir entering the mouth—only then does one know that one’s fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nAn ancient immortal said: ‘Only after this great death does one truly live.’ Another said: ‘Prevail in a single battle, and all under heaven is settled.’\"\n\nThis is precisely such a stage.”\n\nThe above is Master Sanfeng’s account of the great celestial cycle’s passage through the barriers—among ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only this one reveals the secret. It is truly the guiding compass of esoteric cultivation and the mirror of the return to the origin. I have heard my late master say that among the disciples of Master Ke, there was one named Sun Jifu who personally underwent this seven-day practice. All the phenomena of his bodily transformations matched exactly what Master Sanfeng described: “like fire scorching and blades slicing, like beans crackling in a wok, all bursting open at once.” This too is absolutely true. Without steadfast concentration to maintain control, one would be utterly lost at this juncture.\n\nIt is further said that among demonic obstacles, the most difficult to dispel is the demon of form. Unless one’s cultivation of inner refinement has been profound in ordinary times, one will often lose control at this point, overwhelmed by yin forces, leading to grave danger—far beyond mere regression in practice. Therefore, this phase of cultivation must not be hastily undertaken by those lacking deep concentration. Later learners cannot afford to proceed without caution.\n\n39. **Transcending the Womb and Spiritual Transformation**\nMy late master said: “Transcending the womb means shedding the mortal breath of ordinary respiration; spiritual transformation means dissolving the acquired consciousness of the postnatal mind.” His words are concise and precise, beyond further elaboration—a true guiding compass for the cultivation of the esoteric tradition.\n\nAfter completing the great celestial cycle, the adept nurtures the Dao-embryo in quiescence, single-mindedly abiding in forgetfulness, entering the gate of great stillness and perfect illumination. The breath at the mouth and nose ceases entirely, replaced by the internal circulation of primordial harmony. After six or seven months, even eating and sleeping fall away, and throughout the twelve hours of the day, one remains in the state of great concentration. After eight or nine months of further refinement, the six pulses all still, and the primordial spirit shines alone. The Dao-embryo reaches completion, attaining the ultimate of true emptiness and selflessness. The dharma-body can then separate from the physical form.\n\nAs Ancestor Lü said: “After the cold clouds disperse, the waning moon remains; when the winter snow arrives, it turns toward the great void.” This refers precisely to this stage. The “winter snow” signifies the vision of six-petaled flakes falling in concentration—a sign of the spirit’s emergence.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: “Formed and emerged from the womb, one becomes a true child of the Buddha.” This also indicates the maturity of samādhi, the attainment of a body born of insight, and the meaning of transcendence.\n\nIn essence, the cessation of breath marks the great stillness of concentration, the starting point of transcending the womb and spiritual transformation. The complete dissolution of the consciousness-skandha signifies its perfection.\n\nAfter transcending the womb, one embraces the primordial and guards the One, awaiting the re-conception of the “embryonic grandson” and the unhindered division of the body—this is called “nurturing the embryonic infant,” also known as “nursing.” There is yet further work above this: using the true fire of samādhi to forge the mortal frame. Over time, form merges with the Dao, wondrously uniting with the great emptiness. Not only does the mortal body dissolve into emptiness, but even the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind at their most fundamental level melt away into the ocean of inherent nature.\n\nAs Master Sanfeng said: “Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial cycle, forging true emptiness to return to the great nothingness.” This is precisely what he meant.\n\n40. **Shattering the Void**\nSomeone asked: “The sinking of the great earth and the shattering of the void are the great awakening realms of the Chan school. How can the esoteric tradition possess such a state?”\n\nMaster Xuanjing replied: “Not so. Did Zhuangzi not say: ‘The Gate of Heaven is non-being. Yet within this non-being, there is a non-being of non-being—it is here that the sage abides.’? Now, ‘non-being’ is the void. To strike down even this state of non-being—is this not the meaning of shattering the void? When the void is shattered, the attachment to the void (for if one clings to the void, the void itself becomes an object) is extinguished, and one suddenly perceives the inherent nature.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: ‘When even one among you truly returns to the origin, this ten-directional void will entirely collapse.’ The *Liezi*’s ‘King Mu of Zhou’ chapter speaks of ‘the transforming man moving him, and the king seeming to fall into the void’—is this not akin to the *Śūraṅgama*’s ‘collapse of the void’? The realizations of immortals and buddhas align perfectly—what difference is there?\n\nThus, the True Man of Purple Yang said: ‘Parting with the child who rides the crane away, the void shatters to reveal the whole body.’ Master Yuchan said: ‘Joyous, joyous, truly joyous—the void shatters like autumn’s finest down.’ Li Daochun said: ‘Shattering the void to attain great awakening.’ Fan Yunqiao said: ‘Shattering the void, one is utterly at ease.’ Master Sanfeng said: ‘Breaking the void is no trifling matter—it gathers the six directions into a single millet grain.’ And again: ‘As virtue ascends and spirit advances, the void shatters beside the dharma-body.’ Chen Cuixu said: ‘Returning to the origin to restore true emptiness, shattering the void to accomplish the task.’ This is precisely the final step of esoteric cultivation: transcending both emptiness and existence, leaving all dependence behind. Only then does the pure dharma-body pervade the dharma-realm, turning the great Dharma wheel in every land and every mote of dust, entering the ocean of the wondrous awakening fruit, perfectly fused and all-encompassing—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao.”\n\n41. **Guarding Against Danger and Considering Risks**\nThe ancient sage said: “Value great calamity as you do your own body.” And again: “The reason I have great calamity is because I have a body. If I had no body, what calamity could I have?” This means that sentient beings, due to attachment to the body, generate the view of a self, giving rise to all manner of craving and clinging. If one can truly empty this illusory existence, forget the physical form, and relinquish the senses of ear and eye, then one can enter the Dao anywhere—what calamity could there be? “No body” means forgetting the form.\n\nIn the alchemical tradition, guarding against danger and considering risks arise because practitioners cannot forget the form, constantly clinging and lingering, unwilling to let go, thereby inviting all manner of dangers. For instance, during the refinement of essence into qi, if the adept, at the moment of yang’s arising, clings even slightly to the body, desire stirs, and the primordial true yang instantly transforms into postnatal turbid substance, risking the immediate loss of essence.\n\nWhen refining qi to transform into spirit, if one clings even slightly to the body, the already stabilized qi may become unsettled, risking the peril of the elixir’s escape. When refining spirit to return to emptiness, if the slightest attachment to emotion remains, one cannot revert to the Great Void and enter the gate of perfect penetration. Thus, the subtleties of the supreme Dao demand that even the faintest lingering attachment be relinquished—nothing less suffices. The view of the body must especially be cast aside. Tanzi’s *Book of Transformations* sets forth the three barriers of practice, taking the forgetting of form as the entry point, which may serve as a reference.\n\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records that the Dark Emperor ascended from beneath the Sheer Cliff of Wudang Mountain, carrying yet deeper significance. The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: “The noble person who attains it preserves the body; the petty person who attains it treats life lightly.” This distinction between noble and petty lies precisely in whether one can forget the form or not. Those who cannot forget the form face danger at every step; those who leave the body behind walk in safety at every step. For the study of the primordial, any stirring of the mind or arising of thought already deviates from the Great Dao—how much more so clinging to the body?\n\nFormerly, my master instructed me: “Externally, do not cling to the colored body; internally, do not arise a single thought.” These two lines truly encapsulate the essential principles of forgetting the form and relinquishing the body, serving as a guide to guarding against danger and considering risks.\n\n---\n**Appendix**\nLetter from Master Wang to Meng Haoyuan of Tianjin:\n\nHaoyuan, my worthy friend,\n\nI have received your previous letter mentioning the arising of external yang, which I regard with indifference. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir values the primordial above all, not the postnatal. Even reaching the stage of yang’s arising may be considered a minor verification of progress.\n\nYour letter of the nineteenth brings both joy and vexation. Why joy? You wrote: “The qi settles into stillness, and breathing ceases.” This is a great verification of the primordial. Know that the gathering of the true seed, the advancing of yang fire, the retreating of yin tally, the Mao-You ablutions, and the minor celestial orbit—every verification and effect is contained within the four words “breathing ceases.” Without rigorous effort, one could never attain this state. This verification is truly cause for joy.\n\nEarlier, you asked about verifications and phenomena—this is the true phenomenon, the true verification.\n\nWhy vexation? Your letter states: “The yang immediately collapses.” It further says: “Heart and breath interdepend, yet I cannot master myself.” And again: “Suddenly I feel within my abdomen a tugging like the pulling of a bellows.” This is the great calamity that comes from refusing to heed your teacher’s words—truly cause for vexation.\n\nIn every letter I have written, I have urged you to abandon the self, to die at dusk, to learn death, and to study the *Yiguan*. Yet in the *Yiguan*, the teaching on the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is clear from beginning to end: if even a hair’s breadth of attachment remains to the postnatal physical body, it is “a deviation of a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form.”\n\nYou did not believe me, so let me make this distinction plain. If you were not attached to the physical body, how would you know “the yang immediately collapses”? If you were not attached to the physical body, how would you know “heart and breath interdepend, yet you cannot master yourself”? If you were not attached to the physical body, how would you know “the tugging up and down within the abdomen, like the pulling of a bellows”?\n\nAlas! Who is to blame for this leakage?\n\nI tell you plainly: when heart and breath interdepend and stillness is attained, then within and without the body, all is the primordial true qi, true essence, and true spirit. But if even a thread of attachment remains to the physical body, the scriptures say: “In a single instant, all will revert in a moment to postnatal turbid essence, turbid qi, and the consciousness-spirit.” Ah! Without such leakage, this could not be.\n\nThus, the myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures all teach one to guard against danger. To guard against danger is precisely to teach one to guard against attachment to the physical body. If one is not attached to the physical body, what danger could there be? Laozi said: “Set the body aside and the body is cultivated; forget the form and the form endures.” He also said: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble could I have?” Ponder this thrice.\n\nIn refining the Golden Elixir, can one remain ignorant of the need to depart from the physical body? Furthermore, upon grasping this truth, with daily practice, let heart and breath interdepend—always beyond the body—without the slightest notion or awareness of the physical form. Once stillness is attained and breath ceases, this is what the alchemical classics call “entering samadhi.” At this moment of entry, one must forget things, forget form, be without self or other—like a living corpse. The longer the samadhi endures, the swifter the effects manifest.\n\nShould yang arise, swiftly return to the interdependence of heart and breath beyond the body. Upon re-entering stillness, proceed as before. If the physical body experiences sensations like being sliced by a blade, drilled into, throbbing, or itching, remain ever the “living corpse.” With not a single thought stirring, leakage naturally ceases. Practice thus for another week or two and observe the results.\n\nAs for the question of firing times, so long as one is not attached to the physical body, all will align. Yet I have never been inclined to speak of others’ shortcomings or boast of my own strengths. The method transmitted by Master Wang pertains to the lesser teachings of principle and nature, instructing one merely to harmonize postnatal qi and blood. If one clings to the physical body in seeking the Elixir Field, it is no different from drilling into a bronze statue for blood.\n\nStudy pages eighty and eighty-one of *Yiguan*, Volume Eight, and you will understand the location of the Elixir Field. This in reply.\n\n(Excerpt from another letter)\n\nDear Esteemed Brother Haoquan,\n\nLet me once more clarify these matters. As *Laozi* states: *\"Cast aside the body that the body may be perfected; forget the form that the form may endure.\"* And again: *\"My greatest affliction arises from having a body—were I without body, what affliction could there be?\"* These few lines are most profound, most exhaustive. Thus Lü Dongbin said: *\"Learn death before death, and you attain longevity.\"* And Bai Yuchan declared: *\"If one is not burdened by the form, the Great Brahma Heaven lies before one’s eyes.\"* The masters who have expounded Laozi’s teachings are too numerous to count.\n\nEach time I receive your letters, I am deeply moved by your earnest yet pitiable plight. Alas! If you truly wish to study the Dao, you must read the foundational texts of the patriarchs. Yet you have not only failed to master the Five Schools’ patriarchal works—you have not even encountered the twelve books of the Southern Five Patriarchs and Northern Seven Perfected. What you have read are merely introductory manuals, filling your mind with similes, metaphors, and figurative language—like fish traps and rabbit snares—packed so tightly as to be unassailable. If such figurative language were the Dao itself, then all the illiterate of antiquity would have been barred from cultivation. Ponder this carefully: is this right or wrong?\n\n(...omitted...)\n\nYou must understand that the myriad volumes of alchemical texts, with their thousand names and ten thousand appellations, all distill to a single principle: the interdependence of heart-mind and breath. This single interdependence of heart-mind and breath is the essence of those myriad volumes, those thousand names and ten thousand appellations—no distinction exists between them. Without discerning this, it is like knowing a tree: to comprehend the transformations of heart-mind and breath is to know the root of the tree; failing to grasp these transformations, one gropes blindly among its trunk, branches, and leaves—like drilling for blood in a bronze statue. Ponder this: are the root, trunk, branches, and leaves of a tree not of one taste? Can they truly be distinguished?\n\nFurthermore, I observe from your letters that you are again on the verge of leakage. Why is this? In your previous letter, you wrote: *\"Resolve it with the three words: disregard it.\"* Yet now you write: *\"Each time, after one or two minutes, I feel the qi of the kidneys stirring.\"* You also describe *\"the external yang nearly rising but not yet risen\"* and *\"when the kidney qi stirs in samadhi, this is yang arising.\"* You have taken the stale words of Wu and Liu and piled on much more, clinging to the cultivation of the physical body—directly opposing the *\"disregard it\"* you once declared. Earlier, you wrote: *\"Report any signs or verifications at once.\"* These are empty words about the physical form, mere ink on paper. If such reports suffice, how can you fail to recognize that the evidence of practice is precisely the interdependence of heart-mind and breath? You leave me utterly confounded, without any anchor. Without such an anchor, how can I safeguard your method?\n\nYour five-page letter contains only four words of true report: *\"numbness throughout the body.\"* Yet the rest descends again into empty words. Upon receiving this letter, reply at once: how many breaths until you enter profound obscurity and trance? How many breaths until you attain great samadhi? Most crucial are those four words—*\"numbness throughout the body\"*—is this numbness in the interdependence of heart-mind and breath? Is it in profound obscurity and trance? Is it during great samadhi? And how many minutes does the numbness last? Write this clearly and plainly; only then will it be a true report. I will then have an anchor and can discern the state of your practice. Empty words about the physical form, stale phrases on paper—omit them entirely.\n\nIn sum, the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir comprises three stages of practice: first, refining essence to transform it into qi; second, refining qi to transform it into spirit; and third, refining spirit to return to emptiness. All are the interdependence of heart-mind and breath. Ah! When the interdependence of heart-mind and breath is complete, the alchemical path is complete. The transformations at each step are the firing times, the very essence of those thousand names and ten thousand appellations.\n\nI now send you a copy of *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Study it thoroughly, then contemplate it thirty or fifty times—you will then taste the meaning of my words.\n\nWith inquiries after your well-being,\nWang Hu bows respectfully\nThird day of the twelfth lunar month, the fourth year of the Republic\n\nP.S. To my esteemed brother Haoquan,\nFrom Wang Zhenqing\n\nThe day before yesterday, I received your express letter, and my father was greatly displeased upon reading the few lines you appended at the end. Yesterday, he prostrated himself at his desk to draft a swift reply. Today, another express letter arrived, and my father again found it unacceptable. He immediately instructed me to send you this express letter, urging you to temporarily suspend your practice—this is of the utmost importance. For at this stage of your practice, you must not, even in the slightest, attach to the physical body. You must understand that all the primordial pure *qi* that comes to your body will, if even a trace clings to the physical form, instantly transform into postnatal turbid *qi*, which is harmful rather than beneficial.\n\nMy father says: \"Your error stems from the two words 'experimentation' in your previous letter. The distinction between the primordial and the postnatal is a matter of the most minute yet vast divergence—you must pay the closest attention. In all worldly affairs, where there is benefit, there is also harm. At this stage of practice, you must clearly distinguish between the primordial and the postnatal, strictly adhere to your master’s instructions, and not rely on your own judgment in the slightest. Upon receiving this letter, you must suspend your practice at once and await my father’s further instructions before resuming. My father says he too once experienced such phenomena but later corrected himself. The only regret is that we cannot speak face-to-face, for then the error could be rectified in an instant.\"\n\n*(The following is omitted.)*\nRespectfully submitted by your younger brother, Wang Yuchuan\nThirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month\n\n---\n\n**Excerpt from the Master’s Letter**\n\nMy esteemed brother Haoquan, as if in your presence,\n\nI must inform you of two matters that require immediate correction. If you do not rectify them swiftly, there is no need to pursue the Dao at all.\n\nThe first is clinging to the written words of the ancients as the Dao.\nThe second is clinging to the physical body as the Dao.\n\nIn my previous letters, I repeatedly expounded upon the subtle principles of the primordial and postnatal, the Dharma-body and the physical form. Pray reflect deeply: if you cannot transcend the body, how can the body be cultivated? If you cannot forget the form, how can the form endure?\n\nAh! Can you afford to ignore the words of Laozi?\n\nI instructed you to study *The Unitary Principle*, yet you refuse to read it—what is the reason for this?\n\nThe Fifth Southern Patriarch said:\n*\"Lead and mercury are not to be sought within the body;\nThe dragon and tiger must be sought beyond the mind.\"*\n\nAh! Since lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger are not found within the body, you must realize that the crucial step lies *outside* the body. If you would but set aside the practice of questioning written words and instead study *The Unitary Principle*, all would become clear.\n\nFurthermore, Wang Chongyang, the direct disciple of the Patriarchs Zhong and Lü and the foremost of the Northern True Ones, composed *The Complete Reality Collection*, using the three words \"living dead man\" as a guide. He wrote hundreds of poems; I have copied ten for you to contemplate deeply:\n\n1.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nBurying the four illusions is the cause.\nSleeping soundly in the tomb, so carefree,\nBreaking through emptiness, trampling the dust to fragments.\n\n2.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nNeither speaking of karma nor its fruits.\nAt ease in the tomb, as I will it,\nAttaining freedom beyond the six realms of dust.\n\n3.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nToday I speak to you of the great cause.\nDying alone in the tomb is true joy,\nSharing a pillow and coffin, all turns to dust.\n\n4.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nKnow the causes of fire, wind, earth, and water.\nDaily in the tomb, consuming the true elixir,\nExchanging the mortal frame for a speck of dust.\n\n5.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nFinding death within life is the true cause.\nIn the tomb, tranquil and utterly still,\nCut off from the mundane world’s dust.\n\n6.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nThe harm of wind is my former cause.\nIn the tomb, this true message,\nA white lotus rising from water, untouched by dust.\n\n7.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nKnow that the five grains sustain the body’s cause.\nIn the tomb, perceiving the principle of true suchness,\nEating earth, consuming mud, nourished by filth and dust.\n\n8.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nSleeping by day, resting by night, knowing the cause.\nIn the tomb, a true youth,\nLaughing at the clod of earth amidst the dust.\n\n9.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nWithin emptiness, emptiness is the cause of emptiness.\nIn the tomb, the ever-present scene of true emptiness,\nAwakening to emptiness, no longer becoming dust.\n\n10.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nAsking me about the pearls and jade of the living—what is the cause?\nThe tomb’s realm is the true family estate,\nYet in the end, all must face transformation into dust.\n\nMost strangely, in your letters over the past month or two, you have repeatedly asked me for phenomena, for verification, for clarity. Let me tell you again: the Way of the Golden Elixir was called \"the study of chaos\" in high antiquity. For chaos is the state before the separation of heaven and earth. By the end of the Zhou dynasty, Laozi said: \"I know not its name; I style it the Dao.\" Thus, it was also called \"the study of the Dao.\" The word \"style\" denotes that which is without form. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the various perfected ones wrote books teaching people to learn from the dead.\n\nI ask you: can chaos have phenomena? Can it have verification? Can it be made clear?\n\nIf you cling to phenomena, verification, or clarity, you fall into the postnatal physical body—mistaking the servant for the master without knowing it, recognizing the thief as your own child without awareness.\n\nWhat are \"images,\" \"words,\" \"traps,\" and \"snares\"?\nConfucius said: \"An image is a likeness.\"\nMaster Lai explained: \"A likeness is that which resembles or approximates.\"\n\nYet you cling stubbornly to this semblance of resemblance, unshakable in your conviction. Moreover, the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics all warn against fixating on images or clinging to texts—yet you alone insist on doing so. Alas! These are but traps and snares, not the fish or hare themselves. How could you be so utterly confused?\n\nFurthermore, in my previous letter, I sought to report on what you asked: the numbness throughout the body—whether it occurs during heart-breath interdependence, in the state of profound obscurity, or in deep samadhi. All three pertain to the external fire-timing of the prenatal Dharmakaya’s manifestation. Your reply, however, spoke of unclear movements within the body. I asked about the external, the prenatal, the Dharmakaya’s affairs—yet you answered regarding the internal, the postnatal, the physical body’s concerns. Ah! The two are separated by a distance of millions of miles.\n\nTo speak clearly or unclearly—it is nothing but empty words clinging to this stinking skin-bag. You further say: it begins at the bridge of the nose, the glabella, the forehead, the eyes, then spreads to the hands and feet, gradually pervading the whole body. Alas! All of this is clinging to the stinking skin-bag—intolerable, utterly intolerable!\n\nYou also say: \"In the first half, I am in control.\" You say: \"I sense the qi of the kidneys stirring in rotation.\" You say: \"The kidney qi seems to turn inward.\" And all such words—again, nothing but clinging to the stinking skin-bag. Even more intolerable, utterly intolerable!\n\nYou further say: \"For the sake of experimentation, I deliberately used mouth-and-nose breathing.\" I truly pity you on your behalf. What is pitiable? All your effort has been wasted—even more intolerable, utterly intolerable!\n\nCease your practice at once! Urgent! Urgent! If you do not cease immediately, it will not be Wang Dongting who has led you astray, but you who have led yourself astray. For the Great Way of the Golden Elixir yields results with extreme speed, and likewise, harm comes with extreme speed. In my early years, I taught Ke Huaijing and Sun Jifu—at fifty-four, after only nine months, he regained the body of a youth.\n\nLet me reiterate: when you reach the state of profound obscurity, that is *caiqu* (gathering the medicine); when you reach the state of primordial chaos, that is *jiaogou* (the union of yin and yang)...\n\nWhen you reach the state of *dading* (great samadhi), where breath is utterly cut off, this is *zhenxi* (true breathing), *wenhuo* (gentle fire), *muyu* (bathing), *xunzheng* (steaming), and *wenyang* (warm nurturing). When the entire body becomes supple and soft, this is *jinyanghuo* (advancing the yang fire) and *tuiyinfu* (retreating the yin tally). When the entire body grows numb, this is *xing xiao zhoutian* (circulating the minor celestial cycle). In sum, not a trace of attachment remains to the postnatal physical form.\n\nYou insist on deliberately employing mouth-and-nose breathing, clinging to the physical body—no wonder tears fill your eyes, mucus flows from your nose, and sweat covers your body. Illness has already arrived. Cease your practice at once! Do not err further.\n\nWith such resistance, how can I safeguard your method?\n\nMoreover, your encounter with me is a matter of past karmic affinity. You have endured such hardship and advanced your practice to this stage—now, to suddenly demand you cease, I know the human heart: how could you willingly stop?\n\nYet I cannot bear to see you abandon this halfway. After much deliberation between father and son, we must insist: cease your current practice immediately, make swift corrections, and study *Yiguan* thoroughly.\n\nTo say you must study *Yiguan* is not to boast that my work surpasses those of the ancients. Rather, the books of the ancients abound in symbolic imagery but offer few explanations of those symbols. You can no longer afford to read books filled with such imagery.\n\n*Yiguan* does not adopt a single symbol of its own; it only interprets the symbols of others, so you will not be misled by them. Moreover, it is layered and reiterative, teaching you to contemplate the body beyond the body, the physical form and the Dharma-body, the prenatal and the postnatal. If you study it thoroughly, all will become clear.\n\nPerhaps next summer or autumn, you may find time to come to Shanghai and read carefully for five to seven days—or even the year after. In short, unless you have mastered *Yiguan* completely, do not come to Shanghai. I speak plainly.\n\nThis in reply.\n\n—Also, Wang Zhenqing’s letter.\n\nTo Brother Haoquan, with respect:\n\nI have received four express letters from you in quick succession, and all you have written has been read and understood. However, when my father saw them, he could not help but stamp his feet in dismay, exclaiming repeatedly, \"This will not do! How could such errors arise?\"\n\nHe instructed me to send this express letter at once, urging you to suspend your practice immediately and under no circumstances proceed further. Yet even now, I remain utterly perplexed and can only ask you again and again for clarification.\n\nAccording to what you have written, your progress in practice is truly rare—how then can the distinction between the prenatal and the postnatal still elude you? When your practice reaches the point where your entire body tingles and grows numb, and your ordinary breath settles—indeed, when even the breath seems to cease—if at that moment there remains the slightest attachment to the body or the faintest stirring of thought, the true yang of Heaven and Earth that you have gathered will instantly transform into postnatal turbid qi, causing great harm. Sweat, mucus, tears, and all forms of leakage arise precisely in that critical instant, born of the harm caused by a single thought clinging to the body. This is what it means to be unable to relinquish the body, unable to learn from the dead, unable to enter the state of primordial chaos. If you persist in this practice, you will surely court danger. Thus, I urge you to pause your efforts and study *The Unity of the Three Teachings* thoroughly.\n\nI offer you this analogy: Consider a man past fifty who has no heir. Each time he lies with his wife, he harbors the hope of conceiving a child, yet his wish remains unfulfilled. Meanwhile, those with many children often conceive without such intent, even while holding an infant in their arms. As the common saying goes: *\"With intention, the flower will not bloom; without intent, the willow casts its shade.\"*\n\n\"In this lies a profound truth. For those who study the Dao, if even a single thread of attachment remains to the physical form, the primordial will invariably transform into the acquired. Not only will this bring no benefit, but it will cause great harm, distancing one from spontaneity. As my esteemed father has observed: Your practice has reached an excellent stage, yet it is regrettably hindered by attachment to the physical form. At this level of attainment, the firing times are exceedingly subtle, and it is essential to receive oral instruction from a teacher to truly grasp their meaning.\n\nWhen you last visited Shanghai, we spoke for only two or three days. Such subtle transformations in firing times were not yet discussed at that time, nor would discussing them have been of any use. For in the study of the Dao, one must reach a certain stage of practice before a teacher’s guidance can lead to sudden enlightenment. Thus, in my father’s letter, he advised that when a convenient opportunity arises next year, you should arrange to meet and converse for several days—this alone would allow you to achieve a comprehensive awakening. However, if requesting leave proves difficult, there is no need to rush; this is of utmost importance.\n\nMy father further noted: In each of your letters, you mention the exact hours you begin and end your practice—this is already a mistake. Practice is simply natural practice; if you fall asleep while practicing, it is simply natural sleep. To harbor the intention of ending practice beforehand is to revert to the acquired. There is no logic in waiting until after practice to sleep. The opening and closing of the eyes, like all else, should be left entirely to spontaneity. In short, any arising of thought is a return to the acquired, and any attachment to the physical form is perilous. You must take heed.\n\nI recently received another letter from you, which my father read and found deeply unsatisfactory. I have since asked him to annotate all the harmful attachments to the body in this letter, so that you may clearly understand. I am now sending it to you.\" *(Text continues.)*\n\nMay the Dao bring you peace.\n\nYour disciple, Wang Yuchuan, bows respectfully.\nTwelfth month, twentieth day.\n\nTo my esteemed brother Haoquan,\n\nI have received your letter sent last month and have already given a brief reply, which I trust you have kindly reviewed. Now, I shall elaborate further on all matters below, and I hope you will take this into consideration.\n\nAt the very beginning of Daoist practice, the heart and breath must depend on each other. The breath entering and leaving through the nostrils should retain a slight awareness, placed externally—neither forgotten nor forced. If forgotten, spirit and qi scatter; if forced, attachment arises and fire is kindled. The practitioner must achieve a state of pure naturalness, where one’s spirit and qi are always united and placed externally. If sleep comes, simply allow it to occur naturally (even when asleep through heart-breath interdependence, the heart and breath remain interdependent). In this way, one’s spirit and qi (the postnatal yin and yang) are nurtured within external emptiness (the prenatal yin and yang). Is this not like two heavens and four yin-yang?\n\nOnce I have become emptiness, my heart’s light naturally shines downward, and kidney qi naturally ascends (in ordinary people, after the body is broken, heart fire burns upward while kidney water leaks downward). Thus, the postnatal yin and yang within my own body naturally unite without any need for my intervention. I need only hold fast to the fundamental principle of heart-breath interdependence placed externally (the union of heaven and humanity). Then, all progress and verification in my practice will arise naturally (the foundation of the ten thousand transformations). This is the state you have previously experienced.\n\nFurthermore, as heart-breath interdependence is practiced externally with increasing familiarity and purity, the breath in the nostrils may cease entirely, leading to stillness and samadhi. This is when the ordinary breath stops, and the true breath manifests, with every pore of the body engaged in respiration.\n\nInitially, one may feel soreness, numbness, and refreshment in the limbs (achieving this is already a circulation of the microcosmic orbit). After the body is broken, the injuries sustained vary from person to person. With prolonged practice, soreness, numbness, and joy will spread from the crown to the soles, permeating the entire body (achieving this is also a circulation of the microcosmic orbit, after which sweet fluids will naturally fill the mouth, to be swallowed at will—do not rush). At this stage, the practitioner must exercise extreme caution. If one clings to the physical form or entertains a single thought, grave harm may ensue.\n\nFor when I, through heart-breath interdependence, attain stillness, my own body’s heart light shines downward like the sun illuminating all things, fostering growth in boundless clarity—truly unstained by even a speck of dust. Only when I have become emptiness can I resonate with the true yin and yang of heaven and earth within my body (the sensations of soreness, numbness, and pulsation are the advancement of yang fire and the retreat of yin tally). If at this moment one clings to the physical form or deliberately tests the experience, the true yang of heaven and earth instantly transforms into postnatal turbid qi, leading to seminal leakage, nasal discharge, sweat, tears, or blockages causing illness. This is why my father, upon reading your letter, urgently instructed you to cease practice.\n\nIn cultivating the practice of heart-breath interdependence until the breath ceases, entering stillness and samadhi, and experiencing the joy of soreness, numbness, and pulsation throughout the body, one must not cling to the physical form in the slightest. The mind must remain fixed externally (the intention should be present yet absent). At this point, one must become like a corpse in the abyss—utterly abandoned.\n\nWhen internal and external reach extreme emptiness and profound stillness, if yang stirs below, I must swiftly return to external heart-breath interdependence (this must be done instantly, without hesitation). The yang will then subside. Originally, through heart-breath interdependence, I attained stillness externally (note: I was already in samadhi, without breath or awareness, but when yang arises, qi surges upward, making me aware of the breath). Having attained stillness externally, I forget all things and all concerns, existing without self or other, allowing everything to unfold naturally. Thus, prenatal and postnatal yin and yang each find their proper place.\n\nIn short, the Dao of heaven is natural, while human affairs are forced. The practitioner must follow naturalness at every step and must not employ the slightest postnatal intention. This is of utmost importance.\n\nMy father also says: In your letter, you wrote that when the breath ceases, nothing is under your control. This is excellent progress, aligning with the alchemical principle, *\"Let it take the lead while I remain the guest.\"* The only pity is that clinging to the physical form at this stage causes harm.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of breath signifies heart-breath interdependence (vigorous fire), while its absence signifies stillness (gentle fire). Note that interdependence must be placed externally, and stillness must be fixed externally. \"Externally\" refers to the space just beyond the nostrils.\n\nMy father also earnestly instructs you to temporarily suspend practice. Based on your previous letter, which mentioned *\"frequent pulsations throughout the body, with hot qi swirling around the kidney root in the lower abdomen,\"* this indicates that you previously tested the experience while clinging to the physical form, transforming the three treasures of prenatal essence, qi, and spirit into postnatal turbid essence, qi, and spirit, which now afflict you. You must now focus on the principle of *\"purity and stillness.\"* I enclose a copy of the *Tai Shang Qing Jing Jing* (Scripture of Supreme Purity and Stillness). Please read it thoroughly and practice accordingly. With prolonged adherence, the turbidity will naturally recede, after which you may resume practice (this is akin to someone suffering from wind-cold avoiding tonics, lest they cause obstruction).\n\nThis passage requires your utmost attention. My late father also mentioned: I previously sent you a copy of Lu Qianxu’s *Annotated Exegesis of the Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal*, along with Chen Shangyang’s *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. If one wishes to distinguish between the precelestial and postcelestial, these texts explain it most clearly.\n\nQianxu’s exegesis states: “The supreme medicine of today refers to the precelestial—namely, original essence, original qi, and original spirit. Original spirit is the spirit of the primordial chaos before separation, not the spirit of daily thought and deliberation. Original qi is the qi of the great beginning at the dawn of creation, not the qi of mouth-and-nose breathing. Original essence is the most authentic essence, the essence that holds true constancy, not the essence of lustful intercourse.”\n\nShangyang’s *Great Essentials* further explains that the precelestial essence, qi, and spirit each have their names and dwelling places. Both texts elucidate this in their opening chapters—you would do well to study them in detail.\n\nAlas! How could one who has broken the body still possess these three supreme treasures? Once you recognize that the postcelestial physical form is but a foul skin-bag, you must understand that the body is a servant, a thief. If the student fails to awaken and clings to the physical form in pursuit of the Dao, it is like taking a servant as master without knowing it, or mistaking a thief for one’s own child without realizing it.\n\nFurthermore, in future practice, never harbor the notion of “beginning” or “ending” the work. If you can achieve even a few moments of heart-and-breath interdependence, falling asleep would be even better—this will help dissolve the body’s yin qi.\n\nI earnestly hope you will reflect deeply on all of the above. It is my sincerest prayer, though the vast distance between us prevents face-to-face discussion, which I deeply regret. Our detailed conversation must await a future meeting.\n\nBy this postal convenience, I hereby send this reply (all the above was written in response to inquiries from my esteemed father).\n\nWith deepest reverence, I wish you Dao-an.\nYour younger brother, Wang Yuchuan, bows.\nThe nineteenth day of the first month of the fifth year.\n\nAll the above letters are selected from my humble compilation, *Supplementary Records of the Elixir Teachings of the Body-Realized Master*, to demonstrate the dangers of attachment to the body.\n\nAt the initial stage of refining essence into qi, the slightest attachment to the body will immediately give rise to sweating, nasal discharge, tears, seminal emission, and other transformations. If, during the stage of refining qi into spirit, one’s thoughts become attached to the body, the elixir will undoubtedly be lost. The deeper the practice, the more severe the harm caused by attachment to the body.\n\nHow wondrous are the words of Master Tan’s *Book of Transformation*: “Forget the form to nourish qi, forget qi to nourish spirit, forget spirit to nourish emptiness.” These three “forgets” penetrate the three barriers—perfect! Perfect indeed! Nothing surpasses this!\n\n**42. Harmonizing Radiance and Blending with Dust**\n\n\"Harmonizing radiance\" means concealing one’s traces and veiling one’s light, refraining from self-display. \"Blending with dust\" means humbly aligning with worldly customs, moving and acting in accord with others, without setting oneself apart.\n\nLaozi said: “Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, harmonize the light, blend with the dust—this is called profound sameness.” This virtue of profound sameness was esteemed by the Keeper of the Pillars and is also the family teaching of the Old Master. Thus, Master Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* echoes this idea in a quatrain:\n\n*In cultivation, blend with the world and harmonize your light,*\n*Round when round, square when square.*\n*Hidden or revealed, yielding or resisting—none can fathom,*\n*How could others discern your conduct and concealment?*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Preface to Awakening to Reality* states: “The great cultivator harmonizes radiance and blends with dust, sheathes brilliance and blunts sharpness, avoids harm and preserves the body. Dwelling hidden in the marketplace, clothed in coarse robes while holding jade within, adapting to square or round, their conduct and concealment are unfathomable.”\n\nMaster Yongming of the Chan school said: “Conceal your traces, veil your light, act in secret, and employ subtly.”\n\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* says: “The noble person harmonizes but does not drift.” And again: “The Way of the noble person is obscure yet ever more manifest.”\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: “A fine retreat brings steadfast good fortune.”\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all valued concealed conduct, warned against self-display, and did so not only to preserve themselves with wisdom but also to employ the wondrous function of skillful means for liberating beings.\n\n*The Liezi·Heavenly Portents* says: “Master Liezi lived in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk.” Is this not a model of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust?\n\nIn ancient times, the Old Ancestor served as the Keeper of the Pillars in Zhou, Master Guanyin was the magistrate of Hangu Pass, Ge Hong was the magistrate of Goulou, and Master Jingyang was the magistrate of Jingyang—these were true immortals who harmonized their radiance within officialdom. Junping told fortunes, Qi Nian herded sheep, Master Hu sold medicine, Master Cuixu mended barrels, and Sun Simiao practiced medicine—these were true immortals who harmonized their radiance through crafts.\n\nIn the past, my teacher, Master Tianzhi, traveled to Hangao and encountered Master Li Zuhanxu at the Eastern Sacred Mountain Temple in Xi’an. At the time, Master Li was concealing himself among fortune-tellers, mingling with the crowd of character analysts to divine fortunes for others. Master Tianzhi stayed at the inn of Brother Ke for over a year, never revealing his true nature, and was regarded by all as an ordinary paper merchant. All these are exemplars of profound sameness, the wondrous function of Master Hu’s “hidden virtue and subtle mechanism,” serving as models for later generations.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: “When the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten feet.” The onset of demonic obstacles is largely due to self-display inviting misfortune. Therefore, concealing one’s traces, veiling one’s light, and practicing in secret are essential conduct after attaining the elixir.\n\nThe subtlety of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust lies in appearing the same while functioning differently, hence “harmonizing but not drifting.” Not drifting means not being turned by any circumstance. Dwelling among different kinds yet not assimilating with them; dwelling amid sounds and sights yet not being stained by them; dwelling in honor yet not priding oneself on it. Though entering all dharmas, one is not bound by any—this is called appearing the same while functioning differently.\n\n*The Precious Mirror Samadhi of the Cave School* says: “Snow in a silver bowl, a heron hidden in the bright moon—though resembling, they are not the same; when blended, one knows where to abide.”\n\nMaster Caoshan Jiji established three kinds of “falling,” referring to “falling into resemblance” and “falling into following,” which precisely capture the profound subtlety of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust. Yet without penetrating the ultimate barrier, one cannot easily attain this realm.\n\n**Appendix: Master Wang’s Teachings**\n\nFurthermore, after the student attains the elixir, they become “one who has gained the One and is thus numinous,” possessing a foundation of eternal attainment. Even if misfortune strikes, their spirit has its own master, and their qi cannot be invaded or dispersed. They may reincarnate and seize another’s body to complete their work. However, as the student’s practice deepens, they must be ever more cautious in worldly affairs, for “when the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten feet.” The path of the golden elixir most provokes the envy of beings. The ancient saying about “three encounters with heavenly punishment” is truly due to self-display inviting misfortune, not actual heavenly punishment.\n\nWhen, in the future, the practice reaches the stage of rejuvenation, all worldly affairs and human sentiments will gradually conclude, and one will retreat to a tranquil state. If confronted with worldly clamor, respond with feigned foolishness and deafness—this is the most wondrous method. As the elixir texts say: “Blend with the world and harmonize your light, adapting to square or round in response to circumstances.” This point is truly crucial and must be carefully heeded when the time comes.\n\n**43. The Timeline of Dao Cultivation**\n\nAs the ancients said: “Those who skillfully cultivate the Dao accomplish it in a thousand days.”\n\n“It is also said: ‘Three years of diligence, ten thousand kalpas of bliss.’ In the early Qing dynasty, a woman from Guangling practiced the Dao for three years and passed away in seated meditation, leaving behind a gatha that read:\n\n*In stillness, nothing stirs,\nRepeatedly toying with emptiness.\nWhen earth ages and heaven decays,\nAmid the flight of the hun and the loss of the po,\nA master opens the lineage of the Dao,\nYet no method awakens the deluded.\nSuddenly, emptiness shatters—\nThe evening sun remains red as ever.*\n\nAnother disciple of Lü Zu, Zhang Zhennu, left her household and secluded herself for cultivation. After just over two years, she achieved liberation through the corpse.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states: ‘It is like standing a pole to see its shadow, or calling into a valley to hear its echo’—truly no exaggeration. Among the disciples of Master Ke, there was one named Sun Jifu, nearly sixty years of age. Upon receiving his master’s transmission, he practiced day and night with unwavering diligence. In just three months, the foundation of his elixir was laid; after another six months, he reverted to a youthful body. From the initial commencement of practice to completing the Great Celestial Cycle, only nine months had passed. Thereafter, ten months of nurturing the embryo allowed him to attain the ‘mind-generated body,’ achieving effortless liberation. As for the final stage of returning to emptiness, it may take as little as two or three years, or as long as eight or nine, to reach the state of the original, empty essence.\n\nThus, with wholehearted devotion to the Dao, one may attain accomplishment in three years and perfect realization in nine. As recorded in *Marvelous Encounters in the Sea and Mountains* in *The Grass Hut’s Own Record*: ‘Two years after Master Zhong’s departure, I resided in the Zhongnan Mountains, diligently refining the Golden Elixir of the Nine Returns. After nine cycles, the work was complete, and in ten months, my spirit was whole.’ This shows that Lü Zu completed the Great Return and attained the perfection of the embryo within two years. Furthermore, *Records of Immortal Traces* states that Lü Zu, from the age of sixty-nine to seventy-three, completed the Great Dao of returning to emptiness. This further confirms that Lü Zu’s cultivation spanned only seven years.\n\n*Zhuangzi*’s ‘Parables’ records: ‘Yan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Zi Qi: “Since I heard your teachings, in one year I became rustic; in two, I followed; in three, I penetrated; in four, I harmonized with things; in five, they came to me; in six, spirits entered; in seven, heaven was accomplished; in eight, I knew neither death nor life; in nine, I attained the great mystery.”’ Liezi, too, described his own cultivation and realization, which took nine years to transform. Examining the ancients and verifying with recent evidence, those who cultivate the Dao with diligence may, within three to nine years, attain the supreme state of spirit.\n\nFor those burdened with demanding duties, the key lies in stealing moments of leisure amid busyness to regulate the spirit and breath. As the ancient worthies said: ‘Steal leisure amid busyness to refine the external medicine.’ This precisely conveys the essence. If daytime offers no opportunity for practice, one may cultivate during sleep at night. Fall asleep with mind and breath interdependent, and upon waking, resume the practice. Alternating between sleep and practice throughout the night brings the return of spring to the world, yielding no small benefit. This is the method of ‘using sleep to preserve the true,’ a path that follows in the footsteps of the immortal Chen Tuan of Huashan, and aligns with the sage Confucius’ wisdom of ‘entering rest at dusk.’ Truly, it is the sole cultivation method for those entangled in worldly affairs.\n\n**44. The Benefits of Learning the Dao**\n\nZhou Dunyi of the Song dynasty wrote in *The Comprehensive Book*: ‘In the realm of heaven and earth, the most revered is the Dao, the most noble is virtue, and the rarest is humanity. Among humans, the rarest is one who embodies the Dao and virtue.’ The Old Sage said: ‘Thus, though one may establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Dukes, even offering large jades preceded by teams of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.’ Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva declared: ‘If one sits in stillness for a single moment, it surpasses building pagodas of the seven treasures as numerous as the Ganges’ sands. Though those pagodas will eventually crumble to dust, a single thought of stillness attains right awakening.’ Layman Pang said: ‘The world cherishes treasures, but I value a single instant. Gold in abundance disturbs the mind, while stillness reveals the true nature of suchness.’ He also said: ‘The supreme matter in the world is nothing stronger than cultivating the Dao. If one awakens to the principle of non-arising, the three realms naturally vanish.’ The Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: ‘Merely coveting profit, rank, and glory, one fails to notice the gradual withering of the body. I ask: though gold be piled as high as mountains, can impermanence be bought to not come?’\n\nAll glory, wealth, and honor vanish in an instant, belonging to the impermanent. Only the learning of the Dao transcends the forging of yin and yang, liberates from the suffering of the cycle of birth and death, and eternally enjoys the bliss of non-action and true purity—unmatched by any worldly fame or achievement. Thus, the ancients said: ‘Three years of diligence, ten thousand kalpas of bliss.’ Even for beginners, the practice brings serenity to body and mind, harmony to the breath, regulates life, reduces suffering, halts worldly toil, eradicates chronic ailments, saves on medical expenses, and cuts costs for clothing and food (when qi is full, one does not crave food; when qi is sufficient, one does not fear the cold). It yields the effects of peace, longevity, and carefree ease, with all meridians flowing smoothly and the body and mind light and vigorous. The self-enjoyment far surpasses that of ordinary people.\n\nIn recent times, as the world’s population grows and prices rise, life becomes increasingly arduous. Without turning toward emptiness to harness the primordial yang qi of the void and supplement material insufficiencies, enhancing human health, it is difficult to find an appropriate remedy. For while material supplements material, material will eventually be exhausted. Only the void is boundless, and true qi inexhaustible. As long as a single breath remains, one can regulate the breath and concentrate the spirit, returning externally and reverting internally. It requires only willingness, not expense. Thus, this Dao is accessible to all, regardless of poverty or wealth, wisdom or folly, age or youth. All may engage in cultivation according to their capacity, gaining benefits that regulate life’s deficiencies and reduce spiritual suffering. Truly, nothing is more fitting than this.”\n\nMinerals are the treasures of the earth; primordial yang qi is the treasure of heaven, the treasure of the void. Earth’s treasures are finite, while heaven’s treasures are infinite. Earth’s treasures can only nourish the physical body, whereas heaven’s treasures nourish both the physical body and the wisdom-life of the Dharma-body. Those Western scholars who study science and mining, developing the earth’s treasures—how can they compare to the ancient sages of the East, who studied the Dao and thus unlocked the far subtler treasures of the void? The Old Sage said: “Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.” What is this lending? It is the bestowal of the primordial One Qi. The master who so generously lends is none other than the void before one’s very eyes, near and effortless. If we can rest our breathing at the heart of the void, entering the state of profound obscurity, this master will naturally lend us the primordial One Qi. It makes the weak strong, the ordinary sagely, the foolish wise, the sick healed, the withered flourishing, the feeble robust, the blocked unobstructed, the cold clothed, and the hungry fed—fulfilling every wish. The method is utterly simple and easy; its effects are divinely swift. Even the foolish and unworthy can know and practice it—is this not a matter of resolving all with one stroke, universally and equally? True Man Sanfeng said: “When one nurtures spirit and qi, spirit becomes the master that gathers qi. Gather one part qi, and you gain one part treasure; gather ten parts qi, and you gain ten parts treasure. Qi is so precious that in the world, even a hundred taels of gold or jade cannot exchange for a single part.” Thus, the study of qi-transformation in the Mystery School has always unfolded before the seamless pagoda, woven within the cave of emptiness, dwelled in the palace of the Void King, and rested beneath the shadowless tree—gathering primordial yang and assembling the precelestial. Harnessing the true One Qi to defend and nourish body and mind, transforming mortal bones, dissolving the yin of consciousness, instantly ceasing worldly toil, transcending life and death, and forever avoiding the three calamities, it is the teaching that awakens the latent potential of the Chinese people. It can resolve present hardships and eternally preserve boundless ease—why would one not strive to practice it?\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into the Dao De Jing* says in verse:\nAt the hundred-fathom shoal, he casts his line alone;\nNo need to seek the ferry to the Peach Blossom Spring.\nWhen the dragon in the sea’s depths stirs to wake,\nA night of wind and thunder brings spring to the earth.\n\n**45. Subtle Analogies of Fire-Timing**\n*Zhuangzi* inherits the profound and subtle essence of the Old Sage’s double mystery, unlocking the wonders of the Dao without being bound by conventional forms. In this collection, I have repeatedly distilled its essentials. Here, I gather ten subtle analogies of fire-timing for those who study the *Nanhua Jing* to explore deeply.\n\n**1. The Butcher Carving an Ox**\nThe *Essentials of Nurturing Life* says: When Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui, wherever his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot stepped, or his knee pressed, the sounds were crisp and resonant. His blade moved with a *huo* sound, all in perfect rhythm, matching the dance of *Sanglin* and the cadence of *Jingshou*. Lord Wenhui exclaimed: “Ah! Excellent!”\n\n“Has your skill truly reached such heights?” Cook Ding laid down his blade and replied: “What your servant delights in is the Dao—progress beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I follow the natural grain, cleave the great gaps, guide the blade through the great hollows, and rely on what is inherently so. I have never touched the tendons or ligaments, much less the great bones. A good cook changes his blade every year—he cuts. An ordinary cook changes it every month—he hacks. My blade has lasted nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. The joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness. With what has no thickness entering where there is space, there is ample room for the blade to play. Thus, after nineteen years, my blade remains as if newly whetted. Nevertheless, whenever I encounter a complex joint, I see the difficulty, grow cautious, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost subtlety—until the ox falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. Then I stand, blade in hand, look around, and savor the moment with full satisfaction before wiping the blade clean and putting it away.” Lord Wenhui said: “Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life.”\n\nThis passage subtly illustrates the fire-timing of the celestial cycle. The ox is an analogy for the physical body, and the blade’s edge represents the razor-sharp union of heart and breath. At the outset of practice, one cannot yet attain emptiness and spontaneity; the sense of the body remains, and movement is hindered—hence, “all I saw was the ox itself.” Once skill is perfected, body and mind are both forgotten, and the physical body becomes empty—thus, “I no longer saw the whole ox.” The meridians and channels of the human body are often obstructed; when practice reaches great stillness, the external primordial true yang surges through, opening the hundred vessels, and the qi circulates, irrigating above and below. One must follow its natural movement without contrivance. If the true qi ascends along the Governor Vessel and encounters obstruction midway, one may gently employ the *xun* wind to stir it. “Move the blade with utmost subtlety, and the ox falls apart”—this is the original stillness maintained externally. Such is the subtlety of “cleaving the gaps and guiding through the hollows.” The lines “meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses halt while my spirit moves; I follow the natural grain” reveal that when fire-timing reaches extreme purity and spontaneity, nothing is directed by the self; all is governed by the primordial spirit—this is what is meant by “let it be the master while I am the guest.” The four characters “spirit meets, spirit moves” are most profound, for the true primordial state admits no contrivance. Even the slightest intentional arrangement would no longer be “spirit moving.” Thus, the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: “There is a natural true fire-timing,” and also: “Simply rest the spirit and breath, and follow what is natural.” The Dao of Heaven operates the sun and moon in emptiness; the method of the Elixir observes the Dao of Heaven and likewise operates in emptiness. Cook Ding merely used a blade without thickness to enter the spaces of the joints, causing the ox to fall apart like earth crumbling—this, too, is the subtlety of emptiness. Emptiness and spontaneity are the master keys of fire-timing. The Classic states: “The wonder of spontaneity lies in knowing, yet its source of wonder lies in unknowing.” Thus, knowing yet being without knowledge is the ultimate principle of spontaneity.\n\n**2. The Hunchback Catching Cicadas**\nThe *Attaining Life* chapter says: Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback (an old man with a bent back) catching cicadas as easily as if picking them up. Confucius asked: “Is your skill so refined? Or do you have a method?” The man replied: “I have a method.”\n\nIn the fifth or sixth month, if I stack two pellets and they fall, I miss by a mere fraction; if I stack three and they do not fall, I miss one in ten; if I stack five and they do not fall, it is as effortless as picking them up. My stance is as steady as a withered stump, my arm as still as a dead tree’s branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things manifold, I attend only to the cicada’s wings. I neither turn nor sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail to catch them?”\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: “When the mind is undivided, it coalesces into spirit—is this not what the hunchbacked elder means?” This passage reveals the subtlety of fire-timing, which lies in mastery through naturalness, entering the realm of divine transformation. It belongs to the primordial, not something that can be achieved by deliberate effort or contrivance in the postnatal realm.\n\n“The mind undivided coalesces into spirit”—these two lines are the crux. To coalesce into spirit is to seem as though acted upon by divine illumination, beyond the reach of human effort.\n\n**3. The Ferryman Steering the Boat**\nThe *Attaining Life* chapter states: Yan Hui asked Confucius, “I once crossed the abyssal depths of Shangshen. The ferryman steered the boat as if by magic. I asked him: ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He replied: ‘Yes. Those skilled at swimming can learn quickly. As for divers, they can handle a boat the first time they see one.’ I pressed him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?”\n\nConfucius said: “Those skilled at swimming can learn quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for divers who can handle a boat the first time they see one—it is because they see the depths as though they were dry land, and a capsized boat as no different from a cart rolling backward. Though a thousand overturnings and reversals unfold before them, they do not enter their minds. Where could they find no leisure?”\n\nThis passage reveals that the crucial fire-phase lies in the word \"forgetting\"—forgetting leads to transformation. Once transformed and in communion, it is as the *Book of Changes* says of the Kun hexagram: \"Without practice, there is nothing unprofitable,\" just as the diver (one who dwells at the water’s bottom) can steer a boat the first time he sees one. When mind and breath interdepend, one can cross the great sea of birth and death—this is the supreme Dharma-boat. To steer this boat, one must reach the state of mutual forgetting, only then entering the realm of transformation. When the forgetting of concentration reaches its extreme, responses and actions all abide in samadhi, yet this does not hinder handling affairs. Whether in concentration or not, one does not know; whether acting or not, nothing obstructs—just like the diver steering the boat.\n\nAh, how wondrous!\n\n---\n\nFour: *Ziqing Carves a Ju*\nThe \"Attaining Life\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: \"Ziqing carved wood into a *ju* (a musical instrument). When the *ju* was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked, ‘What technique did you use to make it?’ Ziqing replied, ‘I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Yet there is one thing...’\"\n\nWhen I prepare to carve a *ju*, I never dare expend my *qi*, but must fast to quiet my mind. After fasting for three days, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forget that I possess four limbs and a physical form. At this time, I am no longer aware of the court or state; my skill becomes concentrated, and external distractions dissolve. Only then do I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural forms and structures of trees—perfect in their inherent nature. Only then does the *ju* appear before me; only then do I set my hand to it—otherwise, I would not proceed. Thus, it is by aligning the heavenly with the heavenly that the instrument seems to partake of the numinous. Is this not the reason?\"\n\nThis passage hinges on the fasting of the mind and sitting in forgetfulness. As inner cultivation deepens, external distractions dissipate; *qi* becomes abundant and spirit whole. In movement, it follows the course of heaven; in stillness, it abides in profound silence. Aligning with the natural rhythm without calculation or deliberation—this is what is meant by \"aligning the heavenly with the heavenly.\" In this way, one merges imperceptibly with the great transformation, far beyond the reach of thought and measure.\n\nFive: *Ji Sheng Raises Fighting Cocks*\nThe \"Attaining Life\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: Ji Shengzi was raising fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, \"Are the cocks ready?\" He replied, \"Not yet. They are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their *qi*.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Not yet. They still respond to shadows and movements.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Not yet. Their gaze is still fierce, and their *qi* remains excessive.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. They appear like wooden cocks—their *virtue* is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee instead.\"\n\nThis passage in the *Zhuangzi* originally derives from the *Liezi*.\n\nThe image of the wooden cock is one of facing phenomena without attachment, motionless as wood, with the firing process perfectly complete and all emotions extinguished. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"Body and mind are still and unmoving.\" And the Perfected One of Qing’an said: \"Nature is still, emotions are empty, and the mind does not stir.\" Both express this very meaning. Only upon reaching such a state may one safely practice the seven-day Great Celestial Circuit without peril.\n\nLayman Pang said:\n*\"Simply be without mind toward the myriad things,\nWhat harm if the myriad things constantly encircle you?\nThe iron ox fears not the lion’s roar,\nJust as the wooden man meets flowers and birds.\nThe wooden man’s essence is itself without emotion,\nFlowers and birds encountering him are not startled.\nWhen mind and realm are thus, this alone suffices—\nWhy worry the bodhi Dao will not be attained?\"*\n\nThe wooden man of the Chan school and the wooden cock of the Mystery school may be said to be without peer yet perfectly paired, encompassing and resonating with one another—both embodying the wondrous principle of forgetting scheming and stilling thoughts, of suchness and immovability.\n\nWhen Ancestor Lü was refining the Great Return on Mount Zhongnan, demonic lights appeared ten times, yet his mind remained unmoved. This is proof that Ancestor Lü’s firing process had truly reached the level of the wooden cock. Thus, Master Yuchan said: \"Facing phenomena without mind is the Great Return.\" At this stage of the firing process, one can only exclaim: \"Behold, perfection!\"\n\n---\n\n**VI. Lü’s Treading of Water**\n\nThe \"Attaining Life\" chapter states: Confucius observed the Lü Liang waterfall, where the torrent plunged thirty *ren* and its froth surged forty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and, thinking him in distress and seeking death, sent his disciples downstream to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment.\n\nConfucius followed and questioned him, saying: \"I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?\"\nThe man replied: \"No, I have no Dao. I begin with my origins, grow with my nature, and complete with my destiny. I enter with the swirling waters and emerge with the rushing currents, following the Way of water without imposing my own will—this is how I tread it.\"\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with origins, growing with nature, and completing with destiny?\"\nThe man said: \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is my origin. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus—this is my destiny.\"\n\nThis chapter on the firing process reveals the character of *ān* (ease). In ease, one follows the natural course of one’s nature without admixture of artifice or pretense. In ease, one moves with unhurried leisure, free from the slightest trace of calculation. In ease, body and mind are both forgotten, merging completely with the surroundings—thus, there is no obstruction. As for the phrase, *\"I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus,\"* here the subtlety is exhausted and effort forgotten, beyond all description.\n\nLu Fanghu said: \"This resembles the analogy of the diver steering a boat. The water that swirls inward is called *qí*, and the water that surges outward is called *gǔ*. It speaks of water having its own constant course; if one follows it in rising and sinking without imposing one’s own will, one may attain fulfillment. *'Born on the hills and at ease on the hills; growing up in water and at ease in water'*—simply observe the character *ān* (ease). All is in accord with nature, and one does not know why it is so. This is the meaning of acting according to one’s station without seeking elsewhere, finding contentment in every circumstance. Here, amid perilous undertakings, is casually revealed a teaching of dwelling in ease. Wondrous! Wondrous indeed!\"\n\n\"Now, according to my examination, the *Xugua Zhuan* of the *Book of Changes* states: *'After return comes peace; thus it is followed by \"Peace.\"*’ Mencius said: *'When Yu guided the waters, he followed their course without interference.'* When the firing process reaches the state of emptiness and spontaneity, yet one knows not how it is so—like Zhang and Shen steering a boat, following their course without interference—then the wonder defies all description.\n\nThe old fisherman is at ease in water and treads upon water; the Daoist must be at ease in emptiness and tread upon emptiness, merging with the void. Then body and mind are unimpeded: treading water as if it were land, treading land as if it were water, entering metal and stone, ascending into empty space—all is effortless.\n\n7. Dongye Excels at Driving\nThe *Chapter on Attaining Life* states: Dongye Ji presented his driving skills to Duke Zhuang of Song. His advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, his left and right turns matched the compass. The Duke believed no decorative pattern could surpass this and had him trace a hundred hooks before returning. Yan He encountered him and, entering the court, said: *'Ji’s horses are about to fail.'* The Duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned. The Duke asked: *'How did you know?'* He replied: *'Their strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence I said they would fail.'* This passage likewise illustrates the firing process of spontaneity.\"\n\nStraight as the plumb line, round as the compass, weaving and turning with the marvel of brocade’s reversible patterns. For mastery begets skill, and in driving one ascends to the divine. The *Book of Changes* states: *\"Refine principle to the utmost, that it may be applied.\"* Is this not profoundly so? A hundred hooks and back—the horses’ strength could not endure, hence their failure. Yet this was not Dongye Ji’s fault; rather, it demonstrates that use must not be exhausted, for exhaustion leads to failure.\n\n8. Gongchui’s Turning Craft\nThe *Chapter on Attaining Life* states: Gongchui’s turning surpassed compass and square (盖 here means \"to exceed.\" It refers to his hands’ rotation alone, his skill surpassing the tools, reaching the pinnacle of precision). His fingers merged with the object, his mind unburdened by deliberation, so his spirit was unified and unshackled. Forget the feet, for the shoes fit perfectly; forget the waist, for the belt sits comfortably. To forget right and wrong is the mind’s ease; neither inwardly altered nor outwardly swayed is the ease of timely action. To begin with ease and never depart from it is the ease of forgetting ease.\n\nLu Fanghu said: *\"This speaks of the marvel of pure spontaneity. Observe how he discusses ‘merging’—this is what the sages call ‘following the heart’s desire without overstepping the bounds.’ Gongchui shaped vessels without compass or square, merely rotating the object by hand to form perfect circles. The mention of ‘square’ merely completes the phrase. At that moment, his fingers merged with the object, his mind entirely unengaged—hence the words: ‘not deliberating with the mind.’ Though he did not deliberate, his mind was nonetheless present, simply unified and unconstrained. Had his focus been divided even slightly, even mastery would not have sufficed to form the circle. In learning, nothing is more feared than a divided mind or an overactive one. A divided mind leads to distraction and lack of precision; an overactive mind clings to things and fails to merge. Only the unified and unshackled can enter the marvelous. In *Zhuangzi*, even the most refined passages, every word and phrase, conceal profound meaning.\"*\n\nI say: Gongchui’s firing process had entered the realm of transformation, yet it still drew strength from the word \"forgetting.\" The firing process of returning cinnabar is the same—only when one attains Gongchui’s spontaneity can one reach the wondrous realm of the primordial, entering divine transformation. This is what the ancients meant by: *\"With no intent toward Chan, there is nothing that is not Chan.\"*\n\n9. Liezi Practices Archery\nThe *Chapter on Tian Zifang* states: Lie Yukou shot for Bo Hunwu Ren, drawing the bow to its fullest and placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrows, and each successive shaft fitted into the nock of the previous one. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bo Hunwu Ren said: *\"This is the archery of archery, not the archery of non-archery. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread upon perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then?\"* Thereupon, Wu Ren climbed the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, stood at the edge of the hundred-fathom abyss, his back turned and hesitant, with two-tenths of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Yukou forward. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming to his heels. Bo Hunwu Ren said: *\"The perfected person gazes above into the azure sky, delves below into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your aim is already imperiled!\"*\n\nThis chapter on *huohou* (firing times) demonstrates the stabilization of spirit in profound tranquility, where external phenomena do not intrude and both emotions and perceptions are forgotten. Only then can one gather the great elixir and perform the seven-day completion of the grand celestial cycle.\n\nWhen Liezi trembled in fear, it was evident that his human heart had not yet perished. The \"archery of non-archery\" is the forgetting of achievement. To enter the state of effortless operation—this is the highest level of *huohou*.\n\n**10. The Painter’s Unfettered Posture**\nThe *Tian Zifang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: The Lord of Song wished to have a painting made, and all the painters arrived. They received his bow, stood at attention, moistened their brushes, and ground their ink—half of them remained outside. One painter arrived late, strolling leisurely without haste. He received the bow but did not stand; instead, he went to his lodging. The lord sent someone to observe him, and there he was, stripped of his robes, sitting cross-legged and bare. The lord said: *\"This is the true painter.\"*\n\nThe commentary explains: His leisurely stroll without haste was walking meditation, what the Perfected One of Double Yang called: *\"Let your feet go wherever they will; let your spirit always follow the qi.\"* Sitting cross-legged and stripped of robes—this was also seated meditation. Calming the spirit and regulating the breath, he had no concern for painting, yet the painting was already complete. How wondrous!\n\nZhuangzi’s writings truly convey the Dao, and here they contain a distinct Chan mechanism—stillness, stillness, no need for words. The other painters, moistening brushes and grinding ink, were all entangled in the workings of the discriminating mind. Even if they produced a fine painting, it would be but a dead thing. Better to sit cross-legged, stripped of robes, concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath, utterly unmoving—a naturally living arhat. The intent precedes the painting; the body itself preaches the Dharma. No wonder the Lord of Song called him the *\"true painter.\"* This is also a veiled metaphor.\n\nThe above ten passages describe varying depths of *huohou*. What must be noted is that most contain the principle of *\"concealing the spirit and guarding the qi\"* and the practice of *\"preserving the spirit and nurturing the nature.\"* Gradually, when body and mind become unmoving and one forgets both self and environment, one enters the wondrous realm of spiritual transformation. Only then can one achieve perfect freedom and respond with effortless mastery.\n\n**46. The Secret of Subduing Demons**\nIn *Journey to the West*, among all the demonic beings, the Red Boy possesses the greatest divine powers and the strongest magical abilities—this represents the postnatal deviant fire. Later, the Bodhisattva Guanyin cast down three rings and subdued him. Though called three rings, there were in fact only two: above, *Qian* (Heaven), below, *Kun* (Earth), with the central emptiness as the third—a state where the heart and breath are placed externally, relying on true emptiness. Merely casting down these three rings subdues all demonic beings. Their immense efficacy can thus be imagined.\n\nWhenever postnatal impurities stir or heavenly demons arise, one need only externally unite heart and breath. When true emptiness is attained, all will be at peace. This *\"Samadhi of Subduing Demons through the Great Void\"* is the most transcendent method.\n\n**Excerpt from Master Wang’s Record (from the *Secret Record of Alchemical Instructions by the Body-Realized Mountain Man*):**\nIn *Journey to the West*, the Red Boy represents the postnatal deviant fire, the false yang on both sides of the *Li* trigram. The Black Wind Demon represents postnatal yin essence, the false yang on both sides of the *Kan* trigram. When these two wield their powers, they nearly kill Sun Wukong—how formidable! Without Guanyin’s single ring cast down, they could not be subdued. But once you enter the external emptiness, the Black Wind Demon naturally vanishes, and the Red Boy transforms into Sudhana, ceasing his mischief.\n\n**47. The Wondrous Realm of Harmonious Equilibrium**\nWhen the firing times of heaven and humanity align without error, various transformations arise in the physical body, which can be broadly summarized in the term *\"harmonious equilibrium.\"* As Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states: *\"The prenatal qi, the postnatal breath—those who attain them are ever as if intoxicated.\"* The *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *\"The pores rise like one just bathed; the bones and channels are as if in deep slumber; the spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy; the hun and po cling like mother and child.\"* This is one example of the realm of harmonious equilibrium.\n\nHowever, one must understand that as practice advances, the wondrous realm of harmonious equilibrium also changes accordingly. There is the harmonious equilibrium of the minor celestial cycle, the grand celestial cycle, the seven-day completion of the grand celestial cycle, and the harmonious equilibrium during the nurturing of the embryo—these cannot be generalized.\n\nFocusing on the minor celestial cycle: when the entire body is supremely soft and blissful, this transforms into a state of numbness throughout. Numbness is the profound realm of harmonious equilibrium, and there is an even deeper state beyond it. At this stage, one must verify it with great samadhi.\n\nWang Qiyun’s *Five Degrees of Harmonious Equilibrium* states: *\"Harmonious equilibrium relies entirely on fire to refine the qi, and its effects manifest in five degrees. After three to five years of unshaken stillness, one may suddenly feel a qi ascending to the heart, hearing the sounds of wind, rain, and thunder, with the four limbs and all channels flowing—this is the harmonious equilibrium of ministerial qi, not yet the true Dao. Or after three to five years, one may suddenly hear the sounds of fierce winds, thunderous roars, and war drums, rising to Kunlun and descending to the knees, tasting the five flavors, the tongue producing sweet fluids, the eyes radiating light, and the nose flowing with jade-like essence—this is the harmonious equilibrium of the bladder’s citizen qi. The adept advances further, and other effects appear. After another three to five years, one may again hear the sounds of wind, rain, and thunder, with the hot qi of the elixir field spiraling upward, gradually ascending. This qi travels from behind the kidneys to Caoxi, rising to Kunlun. Sweet fluids are again produced, ascending like ghee to anoint the crown, descending like ambrosia to sprinkle the heart. The eyes flash with lightning-like brilliance—this is the flying golden essence behind the elbows.\"*\n\nThe adept who proceeds to this stage and advances further will encounter yet other signs of progress. Should they dwell in stillness for three to five years, they may hear within the roar of thunder and the sound of tearing silk in the abdomen. The qi resides behind the kidneys, striking the Weilu acupoint, passing through the Jade Pillar Gate, piercing the Niwan Palace and the Kunlun summit. The sound resembles a fierce wind tearing at the earth, while the surging qi descends like a cold spring. This is the Mysterious Pearl descending into the Elixir Palace, where at times the azure sky appears, or moonlight, or white snow, arrayed in the void. Sometimes dragons and tigers intertwine in harmony, or the sun and moon exchange palaces. Though such transformations occur, the adept presses onward, and after another two or three years, new signs emerge, arising from the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Sovereign. The Supreme Unity is the northern Ren and Gui waters, ascending to the Niwan Palace and descending to the Yongquan point. Again, the ears hear the clash of a thousand battle drums and the rumble of ten thousand thunderclaps, like a fierce wind tearing at the earth—this is the great ocean’s release, a thorough ascent and descent, all ablaze with crimson. The fire of the celestial cycle ignites, and the entire body, from head to toe, aches as if the bones are shattered and the sinews pierced. The four limbs and hundred vessels flow without obstruction, the bones seeming to break apart. One may lose awareness for three to five days, reopening the primordial chaos to reestablish heaven and earth. This is the fire of the celestial cycle, the harmony of heaven and earth, the exchange of sun and moon palaces, the transformation of mulberry fields into vast seas. At this stage of practice, ascension is certain—this is the end returning to the beginning, the changing of bones and drawing out of sinews, the Great Harmony.\n\nMaster Qiyun’s discourse may be cross-referenced with Zhang Sanfeng’s *On the Verification of Returning*. The final stage he describes corresponds to the seven-day completion of the great celestial cycle, which Sanfeng elucidates in even greater detail, serving as the definitive guide for the return in the Mysterious School.\n\n---\n\n**48. The Wondrous Workings of Spontaneity**\n\n*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"Only with utmost sincerity does one follow spontaneity.\"\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: \"What spontaneity does is not the path of deceit or falsehood.\"\n*The Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: \"Thus the sage knows the Dao of spontaneity cannot be violated and thereby masters it.\"\n*The Scripture of Great Penetration* says: \"Suchness is spontaneous, boundless and without limit.\"\n*The Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"Heaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called spontaneity. If they are made to know what they do not know, this too is called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, arises from what is not known.\"\n\nMaster Xuanjing says: \"Not knowing is the forgetting of the heart-mind. All worldly arts and skills, without the utmost application of the heart-mind, cannot attain wonder. The methods beyond the world, without the utmost forgetting of the heart-mind, cannot achieve transformation. Thus the Dao’s method lies in spontaneity—this is the wondrous function of forgetting mechanism, responding without intention, constantly functioning yet constantly absent, difficult to exhaust in words.\"\n\nWang Yiqing says: \"Spontaneity is that which nothing can make so, and nothing can make otherwise.\" Thus spontaneity is divine wonder. The divine is that which is divine without one knowing how it is so; the wondrous is that which is wondrous without one knowing how it is so. At its utmost, it cannot be described in words or fathomed by thought. One knows *that* it is so but not *why* it is so; one names *that* which is named but not *why* it is named—where then does the name of spontaneity reside?\n\nThe former master said: \"The scriptures state: The dual-cultivation practice lies entirely in the fire timing. Huo Yun says: The fire timing follows each stage, all depending on spontaneity. To know spontaneity is to know the twofold heaven and earth, the fourfold yin and yang—this too is spontaneous.\"\n\nMaster Qianxu says: \"Spontaneity has a deeper meaning. My teacher instructed me: To follow spontaneity is not to yield to it.\" I say: When a practitioner’s effort reaches the state of spontaneity, every movement and stillness perfectly aligns with the heart of heaven, allowing no room for the slightest contrivance. If one employs the heart-mind to arrange things, they depart far from spontaneity.\n\nSome may ask: The ancient sages said, \"The Dao models itself on spontaneity.\" Yet the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Pure awareness is luminous, neither caused nor conditioned, neither spontaneous nor non-spontaneous, neither non-spontaneous nor non-non-spontaneous, free from all affirmations and negations, free from all characteristics, free from all dharmas.\" This seems to contradict the ancient sages—how can they be reconciled?\n\nI answer: The *Śūraṅgama* refutes the spontaneity of external paths, which is yielding to spontaneity. The spontaneity of the ancient sages is following spontaneity. When attachments are broken, all dharmas are perfectly fused, all suchness is one continuum. The spoken causes and conditions and spontaneity do not depart from the essence and function of self-nature—what hindrance is there?\n\n---\n\n**49. The Essentials of Great Samādhi**\n\nGreat samādhi is the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, where external breathing ceases, and spirit and qi settle into stillness. After prolonged samādhi, body and heart-mind become utterly quiescent, forgetting form, forgetting appearance, forgetting things, forgetting concerns. At this time, the primordial true yang penetrates the physical body, cleansing, irrigating, steaming, and nourishing the constructive and defensive qi, permeating the skin and marrow without exception. It renews the old and transforms the coarse into the wondrous—this is called \"refining the form in true emptiness.\"\n\nThus, for every degree the body and heart-mind attain stillness, emptiness advances by one degree, and primordial true yang advances by one degree. If body and heart-mind attain ten degrees of emptiness, primordial true yang advances by ten degrees. This refinement of qi must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nFurthermore, for every degree the body and heart-mind attain emptiness, the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree. As the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree, the primordial spirit manifests by one degree, increasing brightness and dispelling darkness. When the consciousness-spirit is fully transformed, the primordial spirit is fully revealed.\n\nThus it is said: \"When the heart-mind dies, the spirit lives\"—this is the essential principle of refining the spirit, and it too must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nMoreover, when body and heart-mind attain the utmost emptiness and stillness, the form merges with the void, the six directions all become heart-mind, the six harmonies all become body. Pervading and embracing all, fusing without bound, one may manifest responsive transformations at will, with every thought instantly realized. One may simultaneously enter countless buddha-lands, displaying boundless spiritual powers—this is the final stage of \"returning to emptiness and merging with the Dao,\" and it too must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nThe essence of great samādhi is fully expounded in the *Zhuangzi*. As it states: \"Fish are born of water, humans are born of the Dao. Those born of water thrive by carving out ponds; those born of the Dao attain birth in samādhi without effort.\" It also says: \"When the cosmos is at peace and settled, celestial radiance arises.\" And: \"Abide in great samādhi.\" And: \"The spirit that arises from instability is not borne by the Dao.\" Thus, the marvel of attaining the Dao may be encompassed in the single word *samādhi*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Human World\" chapter states: \"Gazing upon that emptiness, the empty chamber generates brightness. Auspiciousness abides in stillness—if one does not abide, this is called sitting while galloping.\" The esoteric commentary explains: *Que* means emptiness. At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, when inner and outer are both void, at the cusp of midnight, between the waning and waxing moons, when all sounds are hushed—this is the time of \"gazing upon that emptiness.\" When the empty chamber generates brightness, the first yang returns, and the primordial qi arrives at the palace. *Zhi zhi* refers to great samādhi. To be constantly moving yet constantly still is most auspicious, like a bright mirror reflecting images—responding to things without attachment, illuminating yet still, stillness and illumination as one, movement and stillness undivided. Is this not \"auspiciousness abiding in stillness\"? If qi stirs while the spirit scatters, one cannot summon the primordial.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Sutra* states: \"Samādhi and harmony are like clear awareness.\" And: \"At the inception of samādhi, breath is unified; in great harmony, a thousandfold peace. In great samādhi, the true is complete; in wondrous practice, the numinous is communicated.\" The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"When samādhi reaches its peak, clarity arises; when clarity reaches its peak, awakening is fulfilled.\" These all describe the phenomenon of wisdom emerging from long samādhi and clarity arising from long stillness.\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* presents a pure and correct vision. Upon reading his poems, I find he repeatedly reveals the essentials of great samādhi, displaying a unique insight among alchemical texts. He writes:\n*\"When body and heart-mind attain stillness,\nCongeal the spirit and secure qi and essence.\nThe body at ease transcends the leaky,\nThe heart-mind still verifies the unborn.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When body and heart-mind are still, the mysterious teaching flows.\nEssence, qi, and spirit empty, naturally merge.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Refining mercury and smelting lead have no fixed time—\nThe adept must seek them within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Attaining the Dao was never difficult—\nThe work lies solely within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Medicinal substances are gathered only from the formless;\nThe great elixir is wholly forged within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Abiding in stillness, unmoving, one accords with the true constant.\nDissolving all yin, yang naturally returns.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The great elixir’s nine returns and seven reversals—\nThe adept must seek them within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you can maintain samādhi at the proper time,\nYou will know that noon is the third watch.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When the tide rises, water overflows the banks;\nWhen the wind stills, the river’s heart is free of waves.\nNature still, emotions empty, the heart-mind unmoving—\nSitting without dullness or distraction, sleeping without demons.\"*\n\nObserve: the phrase *\"nature still, emotions empty\"* is the true culmination of great samādhi. When refinement reaches this point, no matter what transformations arise in the physical body, all remain utterly still, like the great void. At this stage of the firing process, one may be said to have entered the hall and ascended the chamber. Thus the *Yongjia Song of Realizing the Dao* states: *\"Even if an iron wheel spins atop your head, samādhi and wisdom remain perfectly bright, never lost.\"*\n\nLongmeizi, the true heir of Bai Ziqing, composed the *Poems on Verifying the Golden Elixir*. Lu Zuqianxu wrote a commentary to elucidate them, and the poems also reveal the essentials of stillness and samādhi, as in:\n*\"Only when stillness reaches its extreme does movement arise—\nThis is the boundless becoming bounded.\nThe primordial qi originally emerges from the void;\nThe two modes must be trusted to revolve within samādhi.\"*\n\nQianxu’s commentary states: \"Yuanduzi said: The primordial qi arises from the formless. Thus it is said: *The primordial qi originally emerges from the void.* Immortals steal this true mechanism—gathering it in movement, refining it in stillness. Thus the revolving of heaven and earth, the movement of sun and moon, all proceed from samādhi. The word *samādhi* is most pivotal; the beginning and end of alchemical attainment lie solely within it. If one is not settled at the outset, thoughts and circumstances will not fade, and one cannot properly approach the task of tending the furnace and gathering the medicine. If one is not settled at the end, the firing process will not be harmonized, and one cannot achieve the work of liberating the spirit and transforming the embryo. Thus it is said: *The two modes must be trusted to revolve within samādhi.*\"\n\nThe poem further states:\n*\"To discern the cauldron’s lead, one must settle within;\nWhen yang fire flees, it is spread below.\nWithout meeting a true master’s direct instruction,\nWhere will you resolve the mysterious pivot?\"*\n\nQianxu’s commentary explains: \"The qi of the medicinal substances in the cauldron is subtle. To discern it, one must unify the will, settle the thoughts, attain great samādhi of the six senses, and forget both circumstances and emotions. Only then can one gather it without error. When the yang fire arrives, one spreads it below to welcome it. This requires the true teachings of a true master to practice.\" Since the words of the Eastern School’s founding patriarch are thus, the Western School’s transmission, which takes *\"great samādhi and true emptiness\"* as the secret essentials of elixir-making, is all the more credible and attested.\n\nThus, Master Wang once said: \"The methods of the elixir all return to a single word—*ding* (定, samādhi/settling). This is what is called the Way of utmost simplicity and ease.\" Yet though this be so, to attain true *ding*, one must forget both body and mind, still all emotions and circumstances. Without a measure of bitter effort, how could *ding* be so easily spoken of?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter states: \"Guangyao asked Wu You, ‘Master, do you exist? Or do you not exist?’ Wu You did not respond. (These five characters are missing in the received text and have been supplied from the *Huainanzi* to complete the meaning.) Guangyao, unable to obtain an answer, observed Wu You’s appearance: it was profound and empty. He gazed at him all day but saw nothing, listened but heard nothing, grasped but could not seize him. Guangyao said, ‘This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain non-being from being, yet I cannot attain non-being from non-being. How could one reach this from non-existence?’\" This passage from the *Zhuangzi* depicts the state of *\"great samādhi and true emptiness\"* with divine subtlety. When one is asked and Wu You does not respond, and the practitioner abides in *ding*, even after seven days of completing the great celestial cycle of firing times, such phenomena may arise. Thus, Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Way* says: \"To apply effort in such leisurely stillness—how could it compare to calmly cultivating great *ding*?\"\n\n**Fifty. The Wondrous Function of Killing Life**\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: \"Those who kill life do not die; those who give life do not live.\" Master An of Lingyan said: \"One must know that within killing lies liberation, and within living hides the mechanism. Neither buddhas nor patriarchs can fathom it.\" Layman Pang said: \"To protect life, one must use killing; only when killing is complete can one dwell in peace. Grasping the meaning within, an iron boat floats upon the water.\" Pure Yang said: \"That which lives does not live; that which dies does not die. To kill life after it has arisen, and to learn death before dying—this is long life.\" A monk asked Caoshan: \"Is not a śramaṇa one who possesses great compassion?\" Caoshan replied: \"Yes.\" \"If the six thieves suddenly arrive, what then?\" Caoshan said: \"One must also possess great compassion.\" The monk asked: \"How does one possess great compassion?\" Caoshan said: \"With a single sword, sweep them all away.\" The monk asked: \"After they are swept away, what then?\" Caoshan said: \"Only then is harmony attained.\"\n\nLong ago, Chan Master Shigong, before leaving the household, entered the mountains to hunt. Passing by Master Mazu’s hermitage, Mazu asked him: \"Why not shoot yourself?\" The purport of \"shooting oneself\" is the secret purport of killing life. \"Those who kill life do not die\"—this is the wondrous function of the heart dying and the spirit living. Reviving after absolute cessation, attaining life within death—both Chan and Daoist schools are thus. In the Daoist school, when the heart and breath interdepend, this is the sword of wisdom. When the six thieves arrive, sever them in two with a single blade, leaving no residual attachment. Externally, when breath and qi attain great *ding*, and internally, when not a single thought arises in the center, with inner and outer purity and emptiness—this is the moment of \"harmony.\"\n\nWhenever practicing the work, if one becomes aware of any phenomenon in the body, swiftly turn outward to interdepend, without the slightest attachment—this is the wondrous secret of killing life. With prolonged practice, when one becomes aware of any phenomenon in the body, one will naturally and effortlessly depart from the physical form and settle outside, thus forever eliminating the maladies of seminal and qi leakage.\n\nThus, one who truly kills life can truly attain long life. This is the function of reversing the flow, entering the unshakable ground, transcending the ordinary to realize the real—what Chan calls \"cutting off the flow.\" When the flow of life and death is severed, is this not liberation? This is the wondrous realization of non-birth and the wondrous fruit of long life. Without the wondrous mechanism of cutting off the flow and killing life, how could one attain stillness?\n\nOne might object: \"You are a scholar of the Daoist school—how can you recklessly advocate killing life? Now you even teach others to kill life. What is the meaning of this?\" I reply: \"Previously, I spoke of killing life in the conventional sense—merely knowing how to slaughter living beings to nourish this physical form, which only increases karmic conditions and offers no benefit to the Way. This should be abandoned. Here, I speak of killing life by reversing the flow—emptying this physical form and heart, severing the flow of life-and-death thoughts, and emerging from the five skandhas. This is the work of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood. The difference between following the current and reversing it is as vast as heaven and earth—how can they be mentioned in the same breath?\"\n\nShould a beginner inquire, \"What method should one adopt to attain the state of 'killing to the utmost and dwelling in tranquility'?\" I would answer: \"At all hours of the day and night, whenever the slightest wandering thought, stray念, or desire arises, swiftly turn outward to unite mind and breath. During practice, if the slightest stirring of external yang, or sensations of softness, pleasure, numbness, or pulsation occur, the moment you become aware, immediately depart from the body and unite mind and breath externally. When this union becomes effortless, inner and outer naturally harmonize, the six thieves vanish, and body and mind become light and vigorous—this is the secret to 'killing to the utmost and dwelling in tranquility,' the essential principle of refining the self.\"\n\n51. The Profound Meaning of Thrift and Restraint\nThe ancient sage said: \"In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift. Only through thrift can one return early; early return is called accumulating virtue. With accumulated virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome; with nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom one’s limits. When none can fathom one’s limits, one may possess the state. Having the mother of the state, one may endure long—this is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.\"\n\nHere, \"thrift\" does not mean stinginess or withholding, but rather not being swept away by things, the state of the six roots being free from leakage. Leakage is the meaning of \"dissipation.\" The eye, drawn by forms, is led astray; the ear, by sounds, is led astray; the nose, by fragrances, is led astray. Everywhere, one follows the flow of the six dusts, and with movement within, essence is shaken. When essence is exhausted and spirit departs, life follows—thus the ancient sage said: \"Were I to have even a little knowledge, in walking the great Dao, I would fear dissipation above all.\"\n\nNon-leakage is the meaning of \"thrift.\" When the six roots are firmly stabilized and do not follow the six dusts—sounds, forms, and the rest—spirit and qi settle and overflow, the Great Harmony fills and abounds, and brightness endures day and night—this is called \"early return.\" The Way of long life and enduring vision lies precisely here. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—\nClose and seal, do not let them open.\nThe true person hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering, guarding the compass within.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Depart from qi, receive the camp and guard,\nKan ceases to use hearing,\nDui unites without speech,\nRare words follow the primal chaos.\nWhen these three are secured,\nRelax the body in an empty chamber,\nEntrust the will to emptiness,\nTake no-thought as the constant.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Firmly seal their meetings,\nStrive to make them complete and strong.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Close and seal the Dui,\nFortify the numinous root,\nThe three lights sink into obscurity,\nWarmly nurture the child-pearl.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Can one be careless?\nThe first principle of governance\nIs to grasp the subtle and secret.\"*\nAll these are the workings of the word \"thrift.\" In sum, thrift is the wondrous principle of concentrating spirit and securing qi, the six roots firmly stabilized, not chasing after the six dusts. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Reverse the flow to perfect unity, the six functions cease.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Be cautious within, close off without.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Guard against evil and preserve sincerity.\" *The Analects* says: \"Look not at what is contrary to ritual; listen not to what is contrary to ritual; speak not what is contrary to ritual; make no movement that is contrary to ritual.\" All these express the meaning of \"thrift.\" The Wondrous Orthodox Perfected One said: \"Within seeing and hearing, cut off seeing and hearing—this is called the great rest.\" This is the supreme secret of the word \"thrift,\" encompassing boundless wondrous meanings without remainder.\n\n52. Verification in the Dao of the Elixir\nVerification in the Dao of the Elixir may be divided into two aspects: first, verification in the physical body; second, verification in the Dharma-body. As for verification in the physical body, the patriarchs Zhengyang, Ziyang, Cuixu, Sanfeng, and Qiyun have spoken of it in detail. The *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\nMist scatters like wind and rain,\nSteaming and reaching the four limbs,\nThe complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.\nWhite hair all turns black,\nFallen teeth return to their places.\nThe old man becomes a youth again,\nThe aged woman becomes a maiden.\"*\n\n\"Transforming the form to escape worldly calamities—this is called the Perfected Person.\"\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*\"After ten months of toil and hardship,\nGradually gathering, gradually congealing,\nNow the whole body is white blood,\nAnd the four limbs no longer know cold or heat.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"After a year of practice,\nThe six pulses cease, and qi returns to its root.\nA newborn infant dwells in the cinnabar field,\nIts form and appearance just like mine.\"*\n\nIn the *Four Hundred Words Preface* by Ziyang, it is written:\n*\"When cultivation reaches this stage, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and the waves of the Grain Sea settle. The spine moves like a wheel, the four limbs are as steadfast as mountains, the pores feel as if just risen from a bath, and the bones and channels are as deeply relaxed as in sound sleep. The spirit is as joyful as a reunion of lovers, and the hun and po souls are as inseparable as mother and child—this is the true realm, not mere metaphor. Refined by method, it gathers without scattering; tempered by measure, it solidifies ever more firmly. The hun soul is stored, the po soul extinguished; essence congeals, spirit coagulates. With a single intent of harmonious balance, the skin and flesh become radiant and clear. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers, transforming the formless into form, coalescing into the Sacred Embryo. Once the embryo’s qi has congealed, the Infant manifests; the Mystic Pearl takes shape, and the Supreme Unity embraces the True.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Essential Mysteries* reveals various verifications of the method, all trustworthy and attested. His *On the Verification of Returning and Restoration* describes the seven-day completion of the Great Heavenly Circuit in particular detail—among ten thousand volumes of elixir texts, only this one exposes the secret. Truly, it is the great treasure of the Mystic Tradition and the hidden repository of elixir practitioners.\n\nIn general, the essence of the elixir method lies in emptying and stilling the self to attract the arrival of primordial true yang. The deeper the degree of emptiness and stillness, the more abundant the coming of true yang—like a teacup: only by increasing its emptiness can one add more water. As true yang grows ever fuller, the original spirit flourishes, and the power of concentration strengthens. Thus, when refining essence into qi is complete, azure hair regrows, and the skin emits light. Advancing further, red blood turns white, the pupils become square, and the sinews, teeth, blood, and marrow—all undergo transformation, each renewing the old cauldron. At night, sleep is soundless; in labor, one does not tire. Eventually, qi transforms into spirit, eliminating sleep and food; wisdom’s light shines inwardly, and external realms dissolve into emptiness. All this flows naturally, requiring no forced arrangement.\n\nAs for verification in the Dharma-body, elixir texts speak of it only briefly. In my view, what the elixir method values is the Dharma-body, not the physical body. Therefore, from the very beginning, one must depart from the physical body, resting the mind and breath outside the body until great samadhi is attained. Even samadhi is established externally, using its power to subdue delusion and eliminate desire, and employing wisdom to shatter ignorance. One turns birth-and-death into nirvana, transforms affliction into unshakable wisdom, breaks through the five aggregates to emerge from the five turbidities, and eradicates habitual tendencies of views and thoughts without remainder. The true nature becomes perfectly luminous, pervading the Dharma-realm, with the Dao’s capacities fully realized—every thought instantly fulfilled. Thus, verification in the Dharma-body is even more precious than that in the physical body.\n\nAs the Perfected Ziyang said:\n*\"Deep in the night, the moon shines bright,\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\"*\n\nLi Qing’an wrote:\n*\"I ask: what is the verification of completing the work?\nThe moon’s radiance encircles heaven and earth.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n*\"Activate the samadhi fire of the Heavenly Circuit,\nTempering true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Constantly apply the work,\nThe bright moon hangs in the sky, glowing red above the crown,\nIlluminating one’s own master.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The mind and the sun-moon share a great radiance,\nI and heaven-and-earth are inner and outer.\nShattering emptiness is no trifling matter,\nGathering the six directions into a single millet grain.\"*\n\nAll these illustrate the verification in the Dharma-body. The verification of the Dharma-body takes samadhi and wisdom as its foundation.\n\n*Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"The Great Unity flows through it; great samadhi upholds it.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides in stillness.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Follow the ears and eyes in inward communication, while transcending the mind’s knowledge.\"*\n\nThis precisely reveals the image of great samadhi—profoundly still—and wisdom—perfectly luminous.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s section on breaking through the five aggregates describes the stages one must traverse in samadhi.\n\n---\n\n**53. The Classic of Nurturing Life**\n\nIn *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, Nanrong Chu inquired of Laozi about the classic of nurturing life. Laozi said:\n*\"The classic of nurturing life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you abandon others and seek within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be unconstrained? Can you be like a child? A child cries all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony; clenches its fists all day without stiffness—such is the sharing of its power; gazes all day without blinking—its focus is not external. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, flowing with things and moving with the waves. This is the classic of nurturing life.\"*\n\nNanrong Chu said: *\"Then is this the virtue of the Perfected Person?\"*\nLaozi replied: *\"No.\"*\n\nThis is what is called \"melting like ice and thawing like frost.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person shares sustenance with others upon the earth and shares joy with them under heaven. They do not entangle themselves with the gains and losses of others, nor do they conspire in strangeness, nor scheme together, nor engage in affairs. They come and go with carefree ease. This is the classic of nurturing life.\n\nThe commentary states: *Jing* (經) means the constant Dao. This chapter reveals the essentials of the Way of nurturing life: \"embracing the One without separation, and uniting one’s virtue with that of an infant.\" To \"embrace the One\" is to harmonize the heart with the breath, where the two luminaries meet and merge into one, refining the *qi* to achieve softness, just like the state of an infant. \"To stop\" means to be still—concentrating the spirit and entering the *qi*-cavern, so the heart attains stability. \"To cease\" means to rest. As the ancients said: \"Suddenly severing the ten thousand conditions, transcending the stream of life and death.\" Severing conditions is the crucial step in entering the Dao. \"Carefree\" means being unburdened by worldly dust. \"Unconstrained\" means being without knowledge. The following passage specifically illustrates the infant’s essence of harmony and softness, its virtue of unknowing and unawareness. \"Walking without knowing where it goes, dwelling without knowing what it does\"—this fully demonstrates the wonder of forgetting things and self, responding without intention. To nurture life is to reach the state of primordial chaos and unite one’s virtue with that of an infant, so that the spirit is whole and the *qi* is gathered. \"Flowing with things and moving with the waves\"—the phrase *wei yi* (委蛇) is most profound, meaning to neither grasp nor reject things beyond their form. When matters arise, respond; when they depart, do not cling, like the reflection of light on waves—universally responsive yet without intention, following events without attachment. The virtue of an infant is without intention or emotion, neither resisting nor refusing, hence it is said: \"It gazes all day without blinking, cries all day without hoarseness, clenches its fists all day without stiffness.\" \"The Perfected Person shares sustenance with others upon the earth and shares joy with them under heaven\"—this means the heart and breath depend on each other, summoning the true *yang* of heaven and earth, drinking harmony to nourish life, delighting in heaven and accepting fate. Simply entering the samadhi of self-reception, they do not concern themselves with the gains and losses of others, returning to the great void in primordial chaos. \"Coming and going with carefree ease\"—this is uniting with the virtue of heaven, and the classic of nurturing life is complete.\n\nThe formula states:\n*Empty, still, tranquil, and detached,\nHeart and breath unite as one.\nExternally, harmonize with heaven’s harmony,\nAwakening the life-force within.\nLife-force without end,\nLife too knows no bounds.\nThis is nurturing life,\nAnd thus attaining longevity.\nThe mysterious origin of *qi*-transformation—\nThis is the supreme attainment.*\n\n**54. The Wonder of Living Burial**\nLinji Chan Master said: \"In other schools, they cremate the dead; here, we bury the living.\" Master Chongyang said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! Burying the four illusions is the cause. Sleeping soundly in the tomb, utterly free—shattering empty space, trampling the dust to pieces.\" He also said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! Attaining death in life is the true cause. In the tomb, tranquil and empty—true emptiness—cutting off the worldly dust of the mortal realm.\" Again, he said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! In emptiness upon emptiness lies the cause of emptiness. In the tomb, the true scene of emptiness—awakening to emptiness, no longer making dust.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"In the mysterious origin of cultivating the true, nothing is more wondrous than living death and living burial. Where does one perform this living burial?\"\n\nThe answer: The empty space itself is the place of living burial. Preserve the spirit in the void, uniting it with the breath, directly entering the realm of great samadhi. After one round of living burial, attaining life within death, naturally spring arises beyond the kalpas, withered trees bloom anew. At that time, there will be boundless self-reception and endless life-force, as it is said: \"Only after this great death does one now live.\" Thus it is said: \"Having been born, kill life; before dying, learn to die—then you will attain longevity.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"At this moment, the breath ceases as in a small death, merging into one—this is the complete truth.\" Wang Qixuan said: \"When the fire of the celestial cycle ignites, the whole body, from top to bottom, aches—piercing the bones, penetrating the sinews. The *qi* flows through the four limbs and hundreds of channels, the bones as if shattered. One may lose consciousness for three to five days, reopening the primordial chaos, reestablishing heaven and earth. This is the fire-time of the celestial cycle. When the work reaches this point, one will surely ascend.\" The ancients had the metaphor of \"one coffin, two corpses\"—this is the wondrous metaphor for the spirit and breath both stabilizing in the void. When the work reaches the point where body and mind are utterly still and unmoving, then the meaning of living burial is attained.\n\nThe formula states:\n*The fire-time of the celestial cycle,\nCrushing the body to dust.\nThree days in primordial chaos,\nDying and reviving.\nReestablishing the fetal womb,\nRecreating heaven and earth.\nThe wondrous Dao of the mysterious origin—\nFar beyond ordinary sentiments.\nThe wise trust and cultivate,\nSurely attaining longevity.*\n\n**55. The Land of Virtue and the Dao**\nIn the *Zhuangzi*, \"Mountain Trees\" chapter, it is said: Zhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a large tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stopped beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, Zhuangzi was told: \"It is of no use.\" Zhuangzi said: \"This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan!\" Later, the Master left the mountains and lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked: \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\" The host said: \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\" The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi: \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its natural lifespan; today, the host’s goose, by being useless, died. Where will the Master position himself?\" Zhuangzi laughed and said: \"I will position myself between usefulness and uselessness.\"\n\nBetween usefulness and uselessness—this is but an approximation, not the truth, and thus one remains entangled in burdens. Yet if one rides the Dao and virtue, drifting freely, it is not so. Without praise or blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, one transforms with the times, never clinging to a single form. Rising and falling, one takes harmony as the measure, drifting among the ancestor of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be burdened?\n\nThis is the method of the Yellow Emperor and Shennong. As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction; sharpness invites defeat, honor invites criticism, action incurs loss, worth invites schemes, and worthlessness invites deceit. How can one ever be certain?\n\nAlas! Disciples, take heed—only in the realm of Dao and virtue can this be so.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s parable here reveals how worldly affairs are like hooks and files: union and separation, completion and destruction, worth and worthlessness, schemes and deceits—none can escape entanglement. Only by drifting beyond the realm of images and the Emperor, where mind and subtle breath merge in wondrous harmony, where dragon and serpent alike transform, where nature and destiny are cultivated in tandem, where rising and falling unite in harmony, where wondrous being and true emptiness interpenetrate, where the primordial harmony fuses—only by returning to the subtle and formless, transcending the five aggregates, and forever leaving birth and death behind can one attain carefree ease and transcend death without reliance. Thus, to escape the suffering of rebirth and the burden of life and death, there is nothing but the diligent cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\n---\n\n**56. The Joy of Distancing from Dust**\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Mountain Trees\" chapter states: Prince Shao of the Market South called upon the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Prince Shao asked: \"My lord, why do you appear so troubled?\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu replied: \"I have studied the Way of the former kings and cultivated the undertakings of my predecessors. I revere the spirits, honor the worthy, and practice these virtues without the slightest lapse. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled.\"\n\nPrince Shao said: \"My lord, your method of avoiding misfortune is too shallow! The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in rocky caves, and remain still. They move by night and rest by day, ever vigilant. Though hungry and thirsty, they still keep their distance from rivers and lakes while seeking food, ever composed. Yet they cannot escape the snares and traps—what crime have they committed? Their pelts are their calamity.\"\n\nHere the Lord of Lu alone is not your pelt? I wish for you to flay your form and shed your skin, to cleanse your heart and cast off desire, then wander in the wilds where no man dwells.\n\nIn the southern lands of Yue there is a city called the Realm of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with few selfish desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where propriety is born, nor where ritual is led. Reckless and unconstrained in their actions, they tread the great square of the Dao. Their lives are joyful, their deaths are burials.\n\nI wish for you to abandon your state and forsake custom, then walk alongside the Dao as your companion.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"That path is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what can be done?\"\n\nPrince Shao replied: \"Do not be rigid in form, do not linger in place—take this as your carriage.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"That path is secluded and remote, with no one there. With whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?\"\n\nPrince Shao replied: \"Lessen your expenditures, reduce your desires—though you have no provisions, you will have enough. Cross the river and float upon the sea. Gaze upon it and you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the less you will know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, and you will be far from here. Thus, those who possess others are burdened; those who are seen by others are troubled. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was seen by them. I wish to remove your burdens, dispel your troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless realm.\"\n\nLiu Xuxi said: \"How profound, Master! You wander beyond the dust of the world, describing all you see with vivid clarity. You prepare carriages and provisions to send him off—whether as illusion or immortality, it is as it is. Reading to the point where they turn back from the shore, one feels the lightness of casting off old sandals. Is this not the pinnacle of discourse on the land of virtue and the artistry of writing?\"\n\nLu Fanghu’s *Nanhua Fumo* states: \"The entire passage speaks as if scratching an itch through a boot, casually using the fox and leopard to expound on stillness, vigilance, and composure. Clearly, this elder’s words are all parables about the Dao. The fox and leopard bring disaster upon themselves with their pelts, just as the Lord’s troubles arise from the state of Lu—both are burdens of existence. Thus, he wishes the Lord to flay his form and shed his skin to purify the exterior, to cleanse his heart and cast off desire to purify the interior, then wander in the wilds where no man dwells, solitary and alone. This would make him inwardly unaware of himself and outwardly unaware of others—the greatest liberation in the world. What external burdens could then trouble him? The original intent of Zhuangzi and Laozi is simply to urge people to return their hearts to the Dao, to be utterly bare and unadorned, entirely free from worldly burdens. This is the mindset of the sage who possesses the world yet does not cling to it. If one’s duty to the state is weighty, how could one lightly abandon the state of Lu? Yet if we speak of severing attachment and discarding the source of calamity, then everyone has a fox’s pelt, everyone has a state of Lu. The meaning lies beyond the words.\"\n\nXuanjing said: \"This chapter uses the Dao to inspire people to leave the burning house of worldly toil and reach the wondrous realm of purity, stillness, and joy. The so-called boundless realm is the land of the formless and the soundless; the wilds where no man dwells are the state of great samadhi. When scholars regulate their breath and concentrate their spirit, returning their spirit and qi to their root, they pass through the indistinct and obscure to reach perfect stillness. Forgetting things and forgetting cares, without self or others, in a state of unknowing and undifferentiation—this is wandering with the Dao in the boundless realm. As the practice deepens, body and mind become profoundly still, unstained by the six senses, undisturbed by worldly desires. Naturally, one becomes carefree and at ease, transcending all phenomena.\n\nYet this is the principle; the work at the edge of the dharma realm is called 'principle distant from dust'—it does not mean abandoning one’s duties or family. If scholars can cast off everything, then with a few like-minded companions, they may retreat to nurture their nature amidst green mountains and clear waters, roaming freely in thatched huts and stone chambers, far from the bustling marketplace. In such a tranquil setting, the mind easily becomes still, and samadhi and the Dao are readily attained. Thus, Han Qingfu’s poem says: *'The green mountains and flowing waters are my home.'* The ancients attained the Dao in the mountains and forests for this reason—this is called 'both principle and practice distant,' the most sublime path.\"\n\n**57. The Wanderings of Gathering the True**\n*Zhuangzi, \"The Turning of Heaven\"* states: \"The perfected people of old borrowed the Dao of benevolence and lodged in righteousness, wandering in the emptiness of freedom. They ate from the fields of simplicity, stood in the gardens of non-transaction. Freedom is non-action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this the wanderings of gathering the true.\"\n\nExplanation: The perfected people of old regarded benevolence and righteousness as expedients for governing the world, treating them like temporary lodgings without lingering in them. They wandered freely in the land of the formless and soundless, simply following their own inclinations. Simplicity means ease of nourishment. Confucius said: *\"Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its abilities. What is easy is easy to know; what is simple is easy to follow.\"* This \"field of simplicity\" is the empty space beyond the body—what the school of the mysterious calls the Yellow Court, the Center of the Compass, the Chamber of Spirit, the Earthen Cauldron, the Cinnabar Field. Concentrating the spirit here and merging it wondrously with the breath, one enters fetal breathing. The external senses draw in the primordial qi, which enters the body, nourishing the constructive and defensive energies, steaming and melting the fluids—this is the true practice of eating from the fields of simplicity.\n\nThe common folk cultivate gardens and fields to sustain their livelihoods, while Daoists tend the Cinnabar Field to nourish life. The primordial qi of Great Harmony is inexhaustibly summoned and gathered; jade nectar and liquid jasper are endlessly consumed. Such is its wondrous efficacy—hence it is called \"simplicity and ease of nourishment.\"\n\nThose who rely on borrowing have no true exit. Ordinary people’s breath flows in and out without self-mastery; should a single breath fail to come, life is no longer their own. They stand in the garden of borrowed existence. \"Borrowing\" means debt—with the creditor’s claim resting in another, far from secure. The creditor may press demands at any time, leaving no escape. Only when mind and breath interdepend, when external breath ceases yet one remains in perfect serenity—like the antelope hanging its horns, leaving no trace to be found—does the power over life and death shift from another to oneself. Creation cannot then constrain one; this is the wondrous state of non-borrowing. If there is borrowing, there is the breath of exit and entry; without borrowing, there is no breath of exit and entry. With neither exit nor entry, one merges with the vast oneness of heaven—this accords with the mystery of the ancient primordial Dao.\n\nThis great quiescent samādhi of no exit or entry is the profound subtlety of the alchemical school, the true mechanism of gathering and refinement. It is called the wandering of gathering the real—profound and subtle indeed. The secret formula states:\n*Empty, still, tranquil, and serene,\nSpirit and breath harmoniously blend.\nEmptiness and being fuse as one,\nSelf and other are not two.\nWithin and without merge completely,\nNature and life return to unity.\nTrue emptiness, great samādhi,\nBeyond form, beyond name.\nThe gathering that is no-gathering—\nGreat Harmony fills to overflowing.*\n\nThe mysteries of the Daoist school were revealed by Laozi and Zhuangzi. In this profound treatise, the two sages stand as ancestors. Once the treasury of emptiness is unlocked, one may freely partake.\n\n58. The Mystery of Fasting the Mind\nIn the \"World of Men\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, Yan Hui says: \"My family is poor, and for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Can this be called fasting?\" [Confucius] replied: \"That is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.\" Yan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fasting of the mind?\" Zhongni said: \"Unify your will! Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing, the mind to matching signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness—this is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had yet received this teaching, I was truly myself; having received it, I am as if I have never been myself. Can this be called emptiness?\" The Master said: \"It is complete.\"\n\nThe Master [i.e., the commentator] states: *The Zhuangzi* employs the dialogue between Confucius and Yan Hui to illuminate the subtlety of \"fasting of the mind.\" Li Qing’an’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* says:\n\n*To be immortal, Buddha, or Confucian—*\n*The Three Teachings transmit but one emptiness.*\n*From ancient times to now, those who transcend*\n*All cultivate within this emptiness.*\n\nNow, *The Zhuangzi* declares: *\"Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness—this is the fasting of the mind.\"* This precisely reveals that both the Confucian and Daoist traditions begin with emptiness and quiescence, progressing from the interdependence of mind and breath to the realm of great samādhi and true emptiness. Body, mind, and world dissolve entirely, directly attaining \"that which precedes the Lord of Images.\" Self and dharma forgotten, principle and phenomena both extinguished—such is the subtlety of the fasting of the mind. The key to this dharma-gate lies in \"reversing hearing to hear the self’s cessation.\"\n\n*\"Unify your will!\"*—this means directing the will without distraction. Hearing with the ears, hearing with the mind, and hearing with qi constitute three progressive stages. *Zhuangzi* seeks to guide one into profound realization, hence the inverted phrasing: *\"Do not listen with the ears, do not listen with the mind.\"* Beginners listen to the breath with their ears; when the practice matures, the ears are no longer needed—with a single turn of awareness, perception arises naturally. As skill deepens further, even the thought of turning awareness fades, and the mind spontaneously harmonizes with the breath. Breath and mind merge effortlessly, and I simply abide in the naturalness of emptiness. Only when body, mind, and the external world are wholly forgotten can this be called \"hearing with qi.\" From hearing the breath to hearing with qi, one enters the purely prenatal realm.\n\nIn essence, hearing with qi is the true message beyond mind, intention, and consciousness. As *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, it is *\"emptiness and awareness perfectly rounded.\"* The subsequent text states: *\"The ears are limited to hearing\"* (some editions read *\"hearing is limited to the ears\"*), meaning the function of the ears culminates in their capacity to hear. *\"The mind is limited to matching signs\"*—the function of the mind culminates in its capacity for perception. Yet traces of subject and object remain: where there is a hearer, there must be something heard; where there is perception, there must be something perceived. Only upon reaching true emptiness do subject and object dissolve together, leaving only a single emptiness. This is called *\"the samādhi of a single dharma-realm’s adornment,\"* which perfectly accords with the subtlety of the fasting of the mind.\n\nYan Hui says: *\"Before I practiced the fasting of the mind, the notion of self had not yet vanished, and I truly felt the presence of Yan Hui. Once I practiced it, both body and mind became empty, and neither self nor other remained. It was as if 'I halted at the back, losing my body; walked in the courtyard, yet saw no one.' Could this be called emptiness?\"* Confucius affirmed it, saying: *\"It is complete.\"* Yet this is merely provisional approval. One must understand that to sit fixedly in the realm of emptiness is still to dwell in a nest—only when one reaches *The Zhuangzi*’s state of *\"neither having one nor having nothing,\"* where both being and non-being are ungrasped, does one attain the ultimate fasting of the mind.\n\n**59. The Subtlety of Reversing the Flow**\n*\"Following the current, one enters the sea of birth and death; reversing the current, one emerges from the sea of birth and death.\"* The term \"reverse\" means to go against the flow, tracing back to the origin before birth, and attaining \"that which precedes the Lord of Images.\" It also carries the sense of \"returning,\" meaning the *\"revolving return to the origin.\"* *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *\"Entering deeply through one gate in reverse, the six senses become simultaneously pure,\"* and *\"reversing the flow to perfect oneness, the six functions cease.\"* *The Book of Changes* says: *\"Return: cooking, the firm reverses,\"* and *\"tracing origins and reversing endings, one knows the discourse on death and life.\"* The Old Master [Laozi] says:\n\n*The multitude bustles, as if feasting at a grand sacrifice,*\n*As if ascending a springtime terrace.*\n*I alone drift, without sign,*\n*Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,*\n*Unattached, as if with nowhere to return.*\n*The multitude all have more than enough,*\n*While I alone seem bereft.*\n*I have the heart of a fool—how muddled!*\n*The vulgar are bright; I alone am dim.*\n*The vulgar are sharp; I alone am dull.*\n\nHe also says: *\"Profound virtue is deep and far, turning back with things,\"* and *\"return to the root, return to simplicity, return to the limitless, return to nothingness.\"* All these are the esoteric principles of reversing the flow and the practice of revolving return. *\"I alone seem bereft\"*—this is the forgetting of both inner and outer, body and mind. *\"Dim\"*—this is the state of primal chaos, knowing nothing and perceiving nothing. Master Sanfeng says: *\"Return to a state of dull silence, like one drunk or foolish.\"* At the moment of coalescing the elixir, the hundred vessels return to their source, and the breath ceases as in a small death—this is the true realm of dullness and oblivion, the authentic message of the Daoist tradition’s *\"reversing the flow to perfect oneness, where the six functions cease.\"*\n\nIn *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s assembly, the twenty-five sages each expounded their path to perfect penetration. For instance, Aniruddha’s *\"revolving vision to follow the origin,\"* Gavāṃpati’s *\"returning taste to revolve awareness,\"* Subhūti’s *\"revolving dharmas to return to nothingness,\"* Cūḍapanthaka’s *\"reversing breath to empty space,\"* and Avalokiteśvara’s *\"entering the flow and forgetting the source\"*—all illustrate the purport of reversing the flow. In the Daoist tradition, practice begins with regulating the breath, its subtlety lying in revolving hearing to merge with the breath, and revolving the breath to return to the origin. This perfectly aligns with the Buddhist principle of *\"reversing breath to empty space.\"* \"Reversing the breath\" means shifting from the breath of existence to the breath of non-existence. The breath of non-breath is called the true breath. The Daoist tradition, through revolving the breath, enters true emptiness and emerges into wondrous being, achieving the dual perfection of emptiness and existence, the marvel of both form and spirit. One attains the three liberations, realizes the patience of non-arising, and shares the same fruition as the twenty-five sages.\n\n**60. The Beauty of Yang Harmony**\nWhen spring’s qi is harmonious and mild, when spring winds are warm and gentle, when orioles sing and swallows chatter, when flowers bloom and waters flow—all things at this time flourish and grow.\n\nThe Daoist tradition’s cultivation and realization are perfectly suited to this moment. When heart and breath merge in wondrous union, yin and yang find their kind, bone and flesh harmonize, and spirit and essence rejoice in concord. The primordial unity of qi washes and irrigates, steaming and flowing smoothly, saturating and nourishing the *wei* and *ying* (defensive and constructive qi). Not a single moment passes outside the beauty of Yang harmony.\n\nAncient immortals, in their verses, often invoked the word \"spring\" to depict the joy of serene harmony. *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Make it harmonious and joyful, flowing without losing its delight. Let day and night be seamless, and unite with things as spring—this is to connect and generate time within the heart.\"* (Meaning: the four seasons do not reside in heaven and earth, but in the unbroken continuity of my heart, where time is ceaselessly generated.) *The Kinship of the Three* states: *\"Cultivate without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain. Drizzling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice.\"* *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *\"The scenery of the homeland is lovely, as wind and rain deepen the spring.\"* Master Zhong declares:\n\n*\"A single primordial true seed,\nEntering the cinnabar field, brings eternal spring.\nWhere pre-heaven and pre-earth return as one,\nIn undivided chaos, how could there be trace?\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The primordial unity of qi, an elixir of a thousand years,\nPreserves a perpetual spring beyond ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nMaster Lü sings:\n\n*\"Rosy clouds drift over fragrant fields where jade sprouts grow,\nMoonlight on emerald peaks where immortal cranes weep.\nThe celestial grotto’s message runs deep in spring,\nThe immortal’s path is trodden—mortals cannot follow.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"A gourd of spring wine at the tip of my staff,\nA furnace of cinnabar yielding ten thousand specks of gold.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Since awakening to the true body,\nI have won the eternal spring of Penglai.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Twelve thousand cycles of sixty years,\nThis gourd holds everlasting spring’s radiance.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Temper the marrow, refine the root,\nPetals of peach blossoms in the grotto’s spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"A green serpent in hand ascends the white sun,\nImmortal fruits in the cave bear everlasting spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The guest’s gourd always holds wine,\nThe alchemical furnace harbors another spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Clad in bark, fed on wood, in the grotto’s spring,\nAn ancient sword at my brow refines the pristine spirit.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"All day without a word to share the news,\nA gourd of spring wine leaves me drunk and blissful.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The elixir of longevity, the heart of the flower,\nLayered petals bloom in radiant spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"One, three, five—all numbers are spring,\nPost-earth and pre-heaven reveal the Old Lord.\nFlowers bloom in western rivers, brocade unfurled,\nMoonlight brightens the northern sea, celebrating wind and cloud.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Forgetting the interplay of form and emptiness,\nI brew morning and evening’s eternal spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Within the abdomen, creation moves naturally,\nIn the furnace, heaven and earth hold primeval spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Once the countenance is perfected, the three realms grow small,\nThe master dwells in the spring of all four seasons.\"*\n\nMaster Cuixu says:\n\n*\"When primordial qi returns to the furnace and spirit does not scatter,\nSpring mountains, spring waters, and spring winds arise of themselves.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"A hundred thousand jade dragons roar without end,\nA river of spring moonlight follows the fishing boat.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Only within the jade gourd’s spring hues,\nDo I pluck a flower to ask Fuxi and Xuanyuan.\"*\n\nMaster Yuchan declares:\n\n*\"Seek the body beyond the body within,\nIn the harmony of emptiness—a gourd of spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Green dragon and white tiger encircle the golden tripod,\nAt midnight, a single yellow sprout—a branch of spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Flowers sway in spring winds, birds sing of their own accord,\nWho knows the Maker’s spring is heaven?\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The golden elder and the radiant maiden wed,\nPeach blossoms at the grotto’s mouth bloom daily in spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"In the Hall of Wondrous Union, quietly nurture the spirit,\nWhere spirit congeals and qi gathers—a gourd of spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"For over two years in the thatched hut of Wuyi,\nFlowers laugh, orioles sing—spring in a gourd.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Mercury tiger and lead dragon refine spirit and qi,\nLast night, a yellow sprout—a branch of spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"White clouds fill the night sky,\nA single yellow sprout—a blossom of spring.\"*\n\n*The Book of Returning to the Elixir* says:\n\n*\"A thousand miles of deep yin, spring’s qi converges,\nNine skies clear, dew’s essence congeals.\"*\n\nXinglin’s *Returning to the Source* states:\n\n*\"Clouds scatter from the crabapple moon,\nSpring deepens in the willow wind.\nWho knows this meaning?\nI raise my eyes to ask the empty sky.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The heart’s field free of weeds,\nThe nature’s earth devoid of dust.\nIn the stillness of a moonlit night,\nA spring bird’s call.\"*\n\nZixian’s *Restoring Life* says:\n\n*\"Having drunk the numinous elixir,\nOne becomes a carefree person of pure Yang.\nIn the cave’s clarity, ever abiding in luminous stillness,\nPeng Island is eternally in spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Weary of worldly affairs,\nI rejoice in meeting a guest from the Purple Palace.\nA single word of direct transmission,\nAnd the jade grotto’s peach blossoms bloom in spring.\"*\n\nCao Wenyu sings:\n\n*\"A three-foot sword’s qi carried in my sleeve like water,\nA gourd of rosy nectar at my staff—a spring in full.\"*\n\nMaster Qianxu declares:\n\n*\"Startling the black dragon in the sea’s depths,\nA night of wind and thunder brings spring to the great earth.\"*\n\nKe Baozhen says:\n\n*\"The three minds extinguished, harmonize the primordial qi,\nThe four forms forgotten, seek the master.\nBefore your eyes lies the Peach Blossom Land—\nAt this moment, flowers hold buds, awaiting the thunder’s roar,\nWhen all things will burst into spring.\"*\n\nMa Danyang sings:\n\n*\"Fire arises in water—banish the mind’s realm,\nFlowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of thought.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng declares:\n\n*\"Drunk, oh drunk, again drunk,\nThe cinnabar field’s spring glows red as jade.\nFreely drinking the fragrance of the immortal peach,\nThe trigram wind stirs, the primordial qi harmonizes.\nThe battle with yin demons brings a chest full of spring,\nSpirits wail, ghosts cry, heaven and earth overturn.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"A myriad scenes all prove false,\nA single red light is the ultimate truth.\nThis red light is the essence of spring,\nWithin it, as if dust in a bright window.\"*\n\nAnd he further states:\n\n*\"Await that single point to return and submit,\nWithin the body, the four seasons turn to spring.\nA wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance,\nAfter each rain, renewal unfolds.\nAll day languid as a drunken man,\nLeisurely guarding the cavern’s spring.\nWhen yin essence is wholly stripped away,\nIt transforms into a mass of pure yang gold.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Just as the golden water fills the first string,\nIt resembles the orioles and blossoms of a second-month spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Blossoms bloom, birds sing—spring fills the sky,\nInverted dragon’s saliva paired with tiger’s blood.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Suddenly harmonized, spring knows no bounds,\nA sacred embryo is born, called the holy womb.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The Yellow Dame brokers the union of three families,\nDrinking wine, admiring flowers—spring spreads across the land.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Within the gourd, sun and moon; within the cavern, spring,\nTwenty-three years of stillness in the body.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"With a sweep of light, the true is revealed,\nJoyously, the heart brims with spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"With a sweep of light, the numinous is seen,\nRoaming at dawn, lodging at dusk in the crystalline pavilion.\nAwake, at peace; asleep, at peace,\nWhen spring arrives, verdure flourishes everywhere.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The spring of extinguished thought runs deep, the cavern chamber sealed,\nFar from sounds and sights, the true constant is preserved.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The heart like a lotus rising from water,\nThe mind like lightning in the clouds.\nLast night, over a trifling matter,\nI strayed into the Pavilion of Radiant Spring.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"In the Pavilion of Radiant Spring, the moon hangs high,\nJade trees bloom anew, shattering the silence.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"When the host of yin is exhausted, the radiant yang season dawns,\nA branch of spring’s hue, golden blossoms resplendent.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"I await only the moon at Qujiang to cast forth the Metal Ape,\nTreading snow in the mountain of form to seek spring.\nGathering golden essence, I depart the Crimson Waters,\nHarmonizing the true breath to circulate through the body.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Pluck the flower, wear it,\nGather the flower’s heart,\nLayer upon layer of blossoms, spring’s dazzling splendor.\"*\n\nFloating Hill Elder states:\n\n*\"Empty within the spirit, in division or union—all is spring.\"*\n\nShao Yaofu says:\n\n*\"Roaming the profound depths of a thousand sages,\nEmbracing spring’s myriad blossoms in drunken embrace.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"Sipping again and again, slightly intoxicated,\nJoyously, the heart brims with spring.\nNo different from the first meeting of lord and minister,\nOr the primal chaos of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"When qian meets xun, gaze upon the moon’s grotto,\nWhere earth meets thunder, behold the heaven’s root.\nRoaming between the heaven’s root and moon’s grotto,\nThe thirty-six palaces are all spring.\"*\n\nChen Baisha declares:\n\n*\"Nothing added beyond the ordinary,\nYet the heart is ever full with spring’s abundance.\"*\n\nAnd:\n\n*\"The rustic is no mourner of spring,\nFor spring resides in the rustic’s cup of wine.\"*\n\nSuch verses and gathas are too numerous to cite in full.\n\nIn sum, when one’s practice reaches the point where the entire body softens and melts, true qi steams and suffuses, one enters the realm of yang harmony. For every fraction of original yang that advances, a corresponding fraction of yin qi is dispelled. By frequently abiding in this realm of yang harmony, one constantly summons and attracts the primordial unity of qi to the palace. Over time, yin is exhausted and yang becomes pure, and one naturally transforms in form to become an immortal.\n\nThe Mystery School indeed prizes yang harmony, yet the Chan school is no different in this regard. At the moment of great awakening in the lineage, the wondrous luminous true mind—the inherently pure and radiant essence—suddenly manifests. Wherever the realm of yin intrudes, it is wholly dissolved and smelted away, presenting the image of the great earth returning to spring.\n\nHaving perused the *Song Mirror* and *Dharma Grove* and other works, I find that the poems and gathas of ancient worthies extolling \"the beauty of yang harmony\" are beyond counting. Zen Master Dongshan Jia says:\n\n*\"Withered trees bloom with spring beyond kalpas,\nRiding the royal elephant backward to chase the qilin.\"*\n\nGreat Master Mingbin says:\n\n*\"Withered trees roar with dragon’s song, the great earth in spring,\nSpirit roots sprout from cold crag’s grass.\"*\n\nZen Master Fengxue Zhi says:\n\n*\"Ever recalling the third month in Jiangnan,\nWhere orioles sing, a hundred flowers fragrance.\"*\n\nZen Master Ping Zhiyang says:\n\n*\"Clouds part, moonlight fills every home,\nSpring comes, flowers bloom in every place.\"*\n\nZen Master Nanjian Wen says:\n\n*\"Like wind blowing fire—no great effort,\nSpring fills the imperial capital’s four hundred prefectures.\nTipping over the great earth to reveal yang spring,\nMistaking orioles’ songs for entering willow shade.\nDisheartened, night deepens, sobering from wine,\nLaughing at them still lodging in the deep village.\"*\n\nZen Master Li’an Ding says:\n\n*\"Mud oxen bellow at the moon, cold pools sink,\nWooden horses neigh in the wind, Mount Tai renewed.\nGazing up and down, heaven and earth are utterly undivided,\nInstantly teaching grasses and trees to harmonize with yang spring.\"*\n\nZen Master Xiuyan Rui says:\n\n*\"Village songs and communal dances—where is the nāga’s samādhi?\nMangy dogs and mud pigs—pure bodies.\nPenetrating root and dust, no Buddha-dharma,\nUḍumbara flowers bloom across the ten continents in spring.\"*\n\nZen Master Fohui Quan says:\n\n*\"Before father and mother were born,\nWhere was the nose’s place?\nOld hands in the grove\nAll obscure the hiding verse.\nThough Mount Gu sees the opportunity,\nIt still props up the gate.\"*\n\nThe Taiyuan characters dance with a fan,\nToying with idle household trinkets.\nDeep in the mountains, spring’s hues run deep,\nFalling blossoms scatter without number.\n\nZen Master Zetan Zhun says:\n\n*\"In the second and third months,\nHarmonious winds fill the heavens.\nEverywhere, a hundred flowers bloom,\nDistant and near, mountains like paintings.\nForked paths echo with spring birdsong,\nHigh cliffs cascade with spring waters.\nEach and all, the gates of samādhi,\nVast clarity pervades the great wilds.\nA fine true message—\nI write it to send you home.\"*\n\nZen Master Bani Lü says:\n\n*\"Fragrant grasses, slanting sun seal the ancient path,\nAt White Cloud Valley’s mouth, few meet.\nSpring returns, a stretch of moss and lichen green,\nLifting the traveler—no trace remains.\"*\n\nZen Master Chengtian Zong says:\n\n*\"The leaves of the bodhi cannot be gathered in full,\nOne phrase, selfless, seals the myriad dharmas.\nA thousand sages, though full-mouthed, cannot proclaim it—\nBeyond the ridge, the plum’s spring bears no tidings.\"*\n\nZen Master Tiefan Zhou says:\n\n*\"In the human realm, April’s fragrance fades,\nYet mountain temples’ peach blossoms just begin to bloom.\nEver lamenting spring’s departure, no place to seek,\nUnknowing it has turned and entered here.\"*\n\nZen Master Shangfang Yi says:\n\n*\"Gently, mountain fragrance fills the road in flight,\nWildflowers scatter, grasses part and sway.\nSpring’s wind holds boundless, deep intent—\nYet none to whom the orioles may tell.\"*\n\nAn ancient master’s enlightenment verse says:\n\n*\"All day seeking spring, yet spring unseen,\nStraw sandals tread the clouds atop the ridge.\nReturning, laughing, pointing beneath the plum—\nSpring on the branches is already full.\"*\n\nZen Master Wuliang Shou says:\n\n*\"Within the grotto, no clouds—a sky apart,\nPeach blossoms like brocade, willows like mist.\nThe immortals know not winter or summer—\nStone crumbles, branches wither: one year.\"*\n\nZen Master Yuan’an Gui says:\n\n*\"Entering through the gate—no family treasure,\nYet another opens the spring of the earth’s jar.\nMistaking the two sounds and sights of worldly affairs,\nHow much dust is added within the ear!\"*\n\nZen Master Liangting Ti says:\n\n*\"Purple swallows sport in the sunny day,\nYellow orioles sing in the evening breeze.\nThe old land brims with spring’s intent,\nPair by pair, they frolic amid the flowers.\"*\n\nZen Master Baizhang Duan says:\n\n*\"Apes cry in the frosty moonlight,\nFlowers laugh in the spring of Qin Garden.\nAmid the vast red dust,\nEach and all are old friends.\"*\n\nAn ancient master says:\n\n*\"All dharmas from the beginning,\nEver in the mark of still extinction.\nSpring arrives, a hundred flowers open,\nYellow orioles sing in the willows.\"*\n\nZen Master Weizhong Fu says:\n\n*\"The ten-thousand-year bed lies idle, too lazy to sleep,\nDragging steps, supporting the mist atop the ridge.\nWhipping the iron ox to plow the bright moon,\nA single song carries the kalpa’s spring, made whole.\"*\n\nZen Master Tiantong Jue says:\n\n*\"The white ox, sought in the snowy depths—no trace,\nEffort spent, transcending, the body fuses with brightness.\nMoonlight on reed flowers, the sky not yet dawn,\nThe spirit’s sprouts freely trimmed by spring’s wind.\"*\n\nZen Master Baofeng Jian says:\n\n*\"Spring’s warmth, the sun’s harmony—flowers weave the earth,\nThroughout the grove, wild orioles first trill.\"*\n\nZen Master Bani Lü says:\n\n*\"Trudging through the red dust,\nWildly dancing in the western wind, leaving no mark.\nHow many deep thoughts cannot be held—\nLet them tread the spring of the whole garden.\"*\n\nAn ancient master says:\n\n*\"The three realms are only mind, the myriad dharmas clear,\nVase, tray, hairpin, bracelet—all one gold.\nJade steps reflect the spring’s own hues,\nBeyond the leaves, orioles’ fine songs—empty.\"*\n\nZen Master Shimen Yi says:\n\n*\"Seated among clustered peaks veiled in white clouds,\nOrioles sing in the deep valley, unaware

world,\nNow at last revealing the honored one within.\nOne night, the east wind rises at the cliff’s edge—\nBlowing, it makes flowers bloom, spring filling the trees.\"*\n\nZen Master Changsha Ling says:\n\n*\"Wandering the mountains by day, returning,\nThe head monk asked, ‘Where have you been?’\nThe master said, ‘First I went with the fragrant grasses,\nThen followed the falling blossoms home.’\n‘That seems like spring’s intent,’ he said.\nThe master replied, ‘It still surpasses autumn’s dew on the hibiscus.’\"*\n\nZen Master Shanrong Bo says:\n\n*\"Fishing the moon from the Ruoye Stream to its end,\nBlowing the jade flute, spring in the grotto spent.\nLast night, not lodging in the deep palace,\nA single oar, fisherman’s song crossing Meng Ford.\"*\n\nZen Master Xuechao Yi

tips.\"*\n\nZen Master Huanji Ting says:\n\n*\"Wild birds call and chatter endlessly,\nThe East Emperor stealthily turns the kalpa’s spring.\nForest flowers, unopened, lie in disarray,\nYet lingering fragrance cools the drunken.\"*\n\nZen Master Xinwen Ben says:\n\n*\"Holding with both hands, then teaching to let go,\nEmpty body, empty ground—still doubting.\nRoot, dust, consciousness, and realms—no place to seek,\nThanks to the spring wind’s boundless bloom.\"*\n\nZen Master Sanfeng Cang says:\n\n*\"Before the reed’s ash stirs, three feet of snow,\nWhere in heaven and earth is spring not present?\nA thousand mountains, birds silenced; the river frozen deep—\nYet none come seeking flowers or asking after willows.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"Lofty eyes never touched by dust,\nWho is the

spring.\"*\n\nZen Master Weiyi Run says:\n\n*\"The Mother of Transformation is impartial, like a level palm,\nA hundred flowers like brocade—spring is deep.\nUsually embroidering mandarin ducks to

Third of San’yi Monastery says:\n\n*\"Wenshu’s wisdom, Vimalakīrti’s virtue—\nHow to enter and exit, how to speak with perfect roundness?\nThe spring light leaves the east wind’s face unchanged,\nYet lures the cuckoos of Jiangnan to weep.\"*\n\nMaster Xue’an Jin says:\n\n*\"Who let the painted tower stand to the west,\nWhere we meet and laugh in hushed tones?\nHome at last, spring’s colors linger late—\nFlowers fall, and partridges cry.\"*\n\nMaster Shuzhong Yun says:\n\n*\"Crimson strings plucked beneath the night moon,\nEmerald sleeves dancing in the spring breeze.\nThose who harmonize dwell in carefree ease—\nWho else could share such company?\"*\n\nMaster Juelang Sheng says:\n\n*\"With strokes that fail to form ‘eight’ and words that miss the mark,\nThe spring wind brushes the balustrade—flowers still slumber.\nWhere has the young lord gone, not yet returned?\nSweet grasses grow thick, sorrow covering the earth.\"*\n\nMaster Baiyun Duan says:\n\n*\"If you can turn things as

wisp of incense smoke, a tranquil painting,\nA hundred birds stay away, yet flowers bloom red on their own.\"*\n\nMaster Jishui Guang says:\n\n*\"A thatched hut hidden by the stream’s edge,\nBrushing aside mist to transplant lingzhi in a stony field.\nTurning to gaze, the flowers seem drunk—\nUnnoticed, a warbler alights before the window.\"*\n\nMaster Yuan’an Nong says:\n\n*\"Each crimson path the same red,\nA thousand peach and plum trees, ten thousand in full bloom.\nWho recognizes the spring wind’s face?\nFive-colored fragrance meets you everywhere.\"*\n\nMaster Yangshan Qin

says:\n*\"Wind mild, sun warm, spring at its height,\nWillows golden, flowers’ shadows dense.\nEntering the old haunts of Peach Blossom Spring,\nEach peak locks away another peak.\"*\n\nMaster Zhengtang Bian says:\n*\"I ask the world—what keeps men so busy?\nBetter to report spring’s affairs to spring’s light.\nEven if drunk before flowers every day,\nA season still holds ninety such scenes.\"*\n\nHe also says:\n*\"Painting true suchness to life,\nUnfolding it amid the flowers,\nA yellow oriole steals a glance—\nDares not descend from the branch.\"*\n\nMaster Xue’an Jin says:\n*\"Lost his boat in Dongting Lake,\nA barefoot Persian sleeps beneath the waves.\nThough all the world calls, he will not wake—\nSpring’s wind blows him into Apricot Blossom Village.\"*\n\nMaster Yueting Zhong says:\n*\"Fallen leaves have followed the flowing water away,\nSpring’s wind has not yet released the hundred flowers.\nThe green mountains’ visage remains as ever—\nAll day they lie exposed to the fading light.\"*\n\nMaster Tianzi Cui says:\n*\"In the third month, spring just begins to enjoy peace,\nCuckoos call ceaselessly, summoning the fading light.\nLacking the mood to compose a verse,\nHe treads the bright moon’s path, singing as he returns.\"*\n\nMaster Danlu Chun says:\n*\"Spirit soars beyond past, present, and future,\nThe three realms are but a single point of mind.\nBeyond the balustrade, spring’s wind, spring’s butterflies dance,\nBefore the gate, willows, dawn orioles sing.\"*\n\nMaster Gu Yun Jian says:\n*\"A single call awakens a thousand autumns’ dreams,\nTo whom now belongs the boundless scenery?\nLifting his gaze, all is clear—nothing external,\nThe bright moon still shines on the flowered branches.\"*\n\nMaster Ji Zongche says:\n*\"Entrusting his feelings to playful bees leaving flowers,\nTouching sandalwood, the wind from the precious tree.\nTurning to the spring colors in the courtyard,\nA pheasant’s cry shatters the vast emptiness.\"*\n\nMaster Cishou Shen says:\n*\"Eating rice, he bites on grit,\nBreaks his third tooth.\nAfter the spring wind passes,\nEven his staff blooms.\"*\n\nMaster Qianren Gang says:\n*\"Amid peonies’ fragrance, the wind sways gracefully,\nIn pear blossoms’ shadows, the moon is round.\nThe host, drunk, sleeps on the Emperor Fuxi’s pillow,\nGazing at the red curtains’ inverted reflection.\"*\n\nMaster Huimen Kai says:\n*\"Wind high, moon cold, the azure sky stretches,\nSuddenly the Silver River pours its jade streams.\nAll at once, everything becomes one hue—\nA lake’s waters ripple with a lake’s spring.\"*\n\nMaster Quanjian Xu says:\n*\"Beholding the same moon, the realm grows profound.\nEven Buddhas do not know—who is the true kindred spirit?\nPeach blossoms riot in the distant spring wind,\nA thousand miles of longing stir the traveler’s heart.\"*\n\nMaster Zifu Guan says:\n*\"The sky remains vast, the waters clear,\nA silver hook suddenly snares the river-crossing man.\nTurning back against the current to the village shore,\nHe finds the path home, his face alight with spring.\"*\n\nMaster Bojian Jian says:\n*\"At kalpa’s dawn, a patch of idle land—\nOnly the mud ox and stone maiden can till it.\nBefore the millet and sorghum bloom bright,\nPeach and plum are planted to charm with fragrance.\"*\n\nHe also says:\n*\"Why do mountain plums so often flourish?\nOnly because they have endured frost and snow.\nYet the lone rider on his lame donkey stands,\nUnknowing of spring’s descent upon the mossy rocks.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Without the spring wind, flowers do not open;\nOnce open, they are blown away by the wind.\nScattered petals trampled into mud,\nTheir lingering fragrance swells in vain.\"*\n\nMaster Zifu Guan says:\n*\"Spring gardens riot with blossoms like waves,\nButterflies vie in beauty, their scent striking the nose.\nAs the sun sets behind the thatched eaves and dusk falls,\nA frosty moon illuminates the pond.\"*\n\nMaster Xuelun Qi says:\n*\"A single hair’s turn encompasses Mount Sumeru,\nSeized in hand, it brings a smile to the eyes.\nDo not say kin are hard to find—\nAmid the flames of ice-flowers, spring grows lush.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng Cang says:\n*\"No need for guest and host to meet in kinship,\nOne who grasps the divine mechanism transcends all dharma.\nOn a snowy night, plum blossoms usher in spring early,\nWhile the garden’s fragrant herbs remain unaware of renewal.\"*\n\nMaster Gu’an Yue says:\n*\"Whose peach and plum vie in splendor,\nAs cuckoos call again and again, beckoning the traveler home?\nOnce he trod the path by Wuling Stream’s banks—\nThe grotto’s spring surpasses the mortal world.\"*\n\nMaster Gunan Men says:\n*\"Each bout of wind and snow brings deeper cold,\nYet when the cold recedes, spring’s warmth expands.\nWhy labor to repeat what’s already clear?\nWest of the post station lies Chang’an.\"*\n\nMaster Li’an Ding says:\n*\"A towering iron staff grinds against the moon,\nEnduring frost and snow, its spirit shines brighter.\nSuddenly, in the night corridor, it opens a laughing mouth—\nBy dawn, the earth is steeped in spring.\"*\n\nMaster Hongding Jiao says:\n*\"Layer upon layer of mist and rain chant the moss,\nHow does spring’s light arrive from ten thousand miles?\nWhen the partridge calls, the sun warms the clearing,\nAnd the bamboo staff ascends the Terrace of Gazing Home.\"*\n\nMaster Xianghu Ren says:\n*\"Leisurely he climbs, leaning on the railing,\nGazing at the streams and mountains framed like a painting.\nIn the immortal garden, spring winds stir pipes and strings,\nAmid the throng of songs, the sound of rain grows dense.\"*\n\nMaster Haihui Xing says:\n*\"To transplant flowers, one loves the fine, misting rain;\nTo plant willows, one prefers a dim, overcast sky.\nBehold the early spring of Shanglin Park—\nFlowers cradle pearls of dew, willows veil themselves in mist.\"*\n\nMaster Deshi Xin says:\n*\"The spring wind brushes wildflowers into crimson,\nTheir branches high and low, some pale, some deep.\nEndless vistas of water and mountain hues—\nA single bird’s cry echoes through the empty peaks.\"*\n\nHe also says:\n*\"To grasp and release is but wasted effort,\nCircling thoughts lead nowhere.\nSuddenly turning back, spring is late—\nAt the staff’s tip, a single red orb is won.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A hidden bird sings in the tall trees,\nFading blossoms drift upon the flowing stream.\nUnknowing that spring is late,\nThe lotus blooms, its fragrance filling the nine continents.\"*\n\nMaster Falin Yin says:\n*\"Spring reaches the peach blossoms, overflowing the water’s source,\nA world apart, its splendor unique.\nThe fisherman dares not speak of it to others,\nFearing it might stir idle sorrow in his descendants.\"*\n\nMaster Deqing Qi says:\n*\"All because of the moon over Huaidi,\nIt illuminates the spring of Yingyang.\nA single arrow pierces the layered pass—\nHis merit high, yet he raises no banner.\"*\n\nMaster Miaoyun Xiong says:\n*\"A single uncarved lump, the heart of primordial antiquity—\nWho has so cunningly chiseled it, losing its true purity?\nThough one may wield the power to mend the sky with molten stone,\nHow can one resist the East Lord’s early teasing of spring?\"*\n\nMaster Quanyue Zu says:\n*\"The moon over the river, the plum’s sparse shadows sway,\nIn subtle hues, spring stirs in the Penglai gardens.\nA gust of harmonious wind betrays all—\nHeaven is filled with fragrance, guiding travelers to the ford.\"*\n\nMaster Cishou Shen says:\n*\"For saints and mortals, no separate paths diverge,\nYet how many know the source of their own thoughts?\nThe spring wind never reaches Peach Blossom Spring—\nLeaves fall and flowers bloom in their own time.\"*\n\nMaster Tiantong Hua says:\n*\"The garden’s spring lingers on the branches,\nVexing the spring wind, which never rests.\nIdly, at dusk, he gazes upon the river—\nTwo or three fishing boats drift by.\"*\n\nMaster Lan’an Shu says:\n*\"Watching others ride horses and play polo,\nHe realizes only now how late he’s entered the temple.\nThe official road fades as spring reaches its prime—\nThe plum by the river insists he compose a poem.\"*\n\nMaster Zhe’an Fan says:\n*\"Honors and favors bind him in a traveler’s dream,\nThe palace orioles’ calls make him long for home.\nWhen he returns, jade pendants chiming on his steed,\nThe second month’s mountains are all in bloom.\"*\n\nMaster Wanshan Ning says:\n*\"No sign of the pool, no sign of the dragon,\nYet his whole being resides in the Hall of the Empty King.\nAwakening from dreams to the dawn orioles’ songs,\nSpring winds scatter the last petals of peach blossoms.\"*\n\nMaster Touzi Qing says:\n*\"Clouds darken the eastern crags, western peaks brighten,\nFrom the southern islets, the sound of flutes rises.\nThe sky’s light is heavy, his robes damp with sleep—\nOrioles

Jian says:\n*\"Yellow birds flit into the spring woods,\nred blooms fill the branches in the late light.\nFlowers fall, birds return, spring grows still—\nwho now walks this quiet path?\"*\n\nHe also says:\n*\"Spring turns to Yangzhou, ten thousand trees align,\nmist veils tender green, orioles sing.\nA traveler stands alone by the clear river,\nwasting the slanting sun and western haze.\"*\n\nMaster Shangfang Yi says:\n*\"The golden vale’s spring light fills the eyes,\npeonies on the branches blaze with fragrance.\nLast night, a cold western wind blew—\nhow many fallen blossoms

dawn,\nfar steps tread green moss, leaving emerald peaks.\nAlong the way, pear blossoms quench the horse’s thirst in spring—\nriding the bright moon, one arrives in Chang’an by night.\"*\n\nMaster Fachang Yu says:\n*\"How to distinguish hemp from its skin?\nBoil snow to brew tea and sober the drunk.\nBeyond the path travelers have not trod,\nwildflowers smile on old branches in spring.\"*\n\nMaster Zhenjing Wen says:\n*\"Great function manifests, affairs unfold—\nwhere does spring not bloom?\nSend them to the hall for three meals of inquiry:\nthe four seas will know we are

limit?\"*\n\nMaster Wushi Dao says:\n*\"Xuedou’s family treasures,\nthe things he has used all his life—\nhe flings them all out to everyone.\nHere at Wushi, though possessions are few,\nyou must

east or west,\nas apes and birds cry in the deep spring woods.\nHow many travelers gaze in vain—\ngreen mountains stand tall, white clouds hang low.\"*\n\nMaster Su’an Ding says:\n*\"Summer’s red lotuses sway on the jade-green pond,\nfish dart up and down in busy play.\nFragrance rises from both banks, drunken on the warm breeze,\nwashing body and mind in the water kingdom’s perfume.\"*\n\nMaster Meng’an [ ] says:\n*\"Rising early to cherish the flowers, sitting in the spring wind,\nanother has already played with red and green.\nHand in hand, drunk beneath the blossoms,\nunaware of the layered shadows of clouds and moon.\"*\n\nMaster Hengchuan Gong says:\n*\"Why must we join hands to raise one?\nJust call the novice over.\nThe iron pot has no feet, no ears—\nbeneath the wall, spring deepens, leaves unfurl.\"*\n\nMaster Donggu Guang says:\n*\"Three by three, two by two, none the same,\nhand in hand, walking into the grass.\nTurning back, slipping on embroidered shoes—\nwhy not drum up spring in the twelfth month?\"*\n\nMaster Yongjue Xian says:\n*\"Turn the pivot at the center—another mechanism,\na side path few have known.\nAncient halls, clouds deep, no footprints—\nspring winds, growing grasses cross the former stream.\"*\n\nMaster Tudu Ce says:\n*\"The nature of mind has always been one,\nthrough being and non-being, emptiness reveals true emptiness.\"*\n\nFrom ancient times to now, those lost beyond delusion at the source—\nspring enters the garden groves, red in every place.”\n\nMaster Yunzhang Han says:\n*“Bright, bright the message reveals the whole mechanism,\na thousand-yard Chan radiance shines behind the skull.\nWhether this or that, both are lifted away—\nin Jiangnan’s third month, the partridge cries.”*\n\nMaster Kuimu Cheng says:\n*“Spring winds stir, green waves sway,\ncountless boatmen chase the sea tides.\nThey see only gulls skimming white waves—\nhow would they know the bright moon dwells in the cloudy sky?”*\n\nMaster Zide Hui says:\n*“The buddhas of the three times swallow all in one mouth,\nthe old mountain deep and still, moon at dusk.\nLight splits the crown, the noon gate dawns—\nsitting, I watch spring return to the burn scars.”*\n\nMaster Minshan Wei says:\n*“Spring without feet wanders everywhere,\npeach and plum year after year ferment in the valley.\nWhy is spring earlier in the eastern garden?\nA single branch in the snow unfurls fragrant wind.”*\n\nMaster Foyan Yuan says:\n*“In spring days, among spring mountains,\nspring affairs are all spring.\nSpring light illumines spring waters,\nspring qi congeals into spring clouds.\nSpring guests stir with spring feelings,\nspring poems renew in spring.\nOnly those who know spring—\nthrough ten thousand kalpas, the one primordial spring.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Whether you exit or not, from the start it does not depart from samādhi.\nSages arise with worldly passions,\nordinary people become sages.\nInverting use and seizing crosswise,\nsupporting the crooked and revealing the straight—\nspring rain, spring wind, bamboo door cool,\nfalling blossoms, crying birds, a thousand peaks still.”*\n\nMaster Zhenjing Wen says:\n*“Moving against or with, all is verdant spring,\nwhether right or wrong, the spirit does not stir.\nToo often we turn with sounds and sights—\nturning back, we obscure the original person.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“When qi first harmonizes, the ten thousand things spring,\nno need for effort, how could it strain the spirit?\nNot words, not phrases, not script—\njoyous, at the moment, there is a host.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Yunmen, Linji—spring of a hundred blossoms,\neach and every numinous mechanism has its spirit.\nIn the end, it has nothing to do with language—\nmisunderstood transmission misleads others.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Awakened, nothing is not spring,\nin thorny thickets, one nurtures the spirit.\nWhether constant or inconstant, emptiness faces fullness—\nat the moment of opportunity, all depends on the person.”*\n\nMaster Haihui Xing says:\n*“Clouds lock the green cliffs, blossoms fill the stream,\ntravelers come here, yet the path remains lost.\nA single cry of a bird from the hidden valley—\njust when immortals face each other at chess.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“In the Peach Blossom Spring, divining a secluded dwelling,\nchickens, dogs, mulberry, hemp—joy in abundance.\nGathering yellow essence and white atractylodes,\nall at once stored in the medicine gourd.”*\n\nMaster Nantang Xing says:\n*“Exhausting form, withered bones—unaware of spring,\ngrasping meaning, forgetting words, one transcends the dust.\nNo need for wombs, no borrowing—\nthe golden crow emerges from the sea, the moon parts from the clouds.”*\n\nThe above venerable Chan masters, singing the beauty of spring’s harmony, are all eulogies of ancient works. Gathered here, they form a jade forest of jasper trees, a magnificent sight. Though much within holds profound meaning, beginners may not easily fathom it. Yet even a single recitation stirs the vastness of spring’s qi, the grace of spring’s light, the gentle breath of spring’s wind, boundless spring’s intent—unexpectedly aligning with the profound Dao. This too is wondrous.\n\nWhen the mind is still and breath harmonized, water and fire merge as one. Entering the garden of radiant spring, continuing the melody of spring’s harmony, one naturally grasps its subtleties, personally savoring samādhi—beyond what brush and ink can fully express.\n\n**61. The Benefits of Emptiness and Stillness**\n\nThe Dao enters through emptiness and stillness, and is realized through emptiness and stillness. Emptiness means an empty mind; stillness means tranquil qi—this is the profound essential of cultivating both nature and life. If the mind is not empty, qi is not still; if qi is not still, breath is not harmonized; if breath is not harmonized, spirit does not congeal. Only when both spirit and qi are still, reaching great samādhi and returning to emptiness and nothingness, does one attain the true purport of “returning to the root and recovering life.” Thus the ancient sage said: *“Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness—\nthe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nThings flourish abundantly,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called recovering life.\nRecovering life is called constancy.”*\n\nMaster Qianxu writes in *Xuanlan*:\n*“The Dao is fundamentally empty, still, and unified. When stillness reaches its extreme, it moves. Wandering qi stirs in profusion, giving rise to the ten thousand distinct beings, and the Dao begins to fall into the realm of later heaven’s names and forms. Thus, those who embody the Dao originally return to the beginning, taking the attainment of emptiness and guarding stillness as their foundation. Constantly observing within purity and stillness, not a single thing clings—how empty and still! With the slightest thing, emptiness is filled and stillness disturbed. The great void, vast and open—yet a single cloud drifts and obstructs its clarity. The deep spring, limpid and still—yet a slight breeze rises and stirs its waves. How can one restore its original essence? Those who embody the Dao must constantly discipline this mind: what is within does not go out, what is without does not enter. Thus, the breast is clear and unburdened, not a speck of dust clings. In this way, one restores the original sky-like, deep, and limpid essence—this may be called attaining utmost emptiness. Who but those who guard deep stillness can achieve this?”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Thus, returning to the root is the Dao’s movement reaching its extreme and becoming still. Therefore, beings follow the mechanism to enter—hence, returning to the root is called stillness. Stillness then returns to no-thing, thereby restoring creation—hence, stillness is called recovering life. Recovering life is the Dao of true constancy—hence, it is called constancy.”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Those who know constancy are constantly empty, constantly still. Empty, they can receive; still, they can bear.”*\n\nI say: Emptiness is the image of Qian; stillness is the image of Kun. Being empty and still, one embodies the virtue of Qian and Kun. My body and mind merge into the great transformation of Qian and Kun—only then can one assist in the nurturing of creation.\n\nMaster Shao says: *“The sage shares the same body as the Great Void and the same function as Heaven and Earth.”* This is precisely the case. The great person harmonizes their virtue with Heaven and Earth—how could one achieve such harmony without the emptiness and stillness of body and mind?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Heavenly Dao” chapter states: *“The sage’s stillness is not because stillness is inherently good, but because nothing in the myriad things can disturb their mind—hence, they are still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and brows, and its level surface serves as a standard for the great craftsman. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! The sage’s mind is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the reflection of the ten thousand things. Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. Resting in them is emptiness; emptiness becomes fullness, and fullness is order. Emptiness is stillness; stillness moves, and movement attains. Stillness is non-action; through non-action, those who handle affairs bear responsibility. Through non-action, one attains serenity; serenity means cares and troubles cannot abide, and longevity is achieved. Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the ten thousand things. Understanding this and facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao; understanding this and facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun. Practicing this in a high position, it is the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; practicing this in a low position, it is the Way of the profound sage and the uncrowned king. Retiring with this and wandering in leisure, it is embraced by recluses of rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; advancing with this to support the world, it brings great merit, illustrious fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.”*\n\nHe also says: *“Using emptiness and stillness to ride the waves and assist Heaven and Earth, penetrating the ten thousand things—this is called heavenly joy.”*\n\nThe *Carving Intentions* chapter states: *“Emptiness and tranquility accord with the virtue of Heaven.”* *“Unchanging oneness is the perfection of stillness; nothing opposing it is the perfection of emptiness; no interaction with things is the perfection of tranquility; nothing resisting it is the perfection of purity. Thus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, tranquil and non-active, moving in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit.”*\n\nThe *Human World* chapter states: *“Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”*\n\nThe *Liezi* says: *“Nothing surpasses stillness; nothing surpasses emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these attain their proper place.”*\n\nI observe: What the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* expound fully inherits the intent of the ancient sages’ *“attaining emptiness and guarding stillness.”* This is the orthodox lineage of the profound tradition, the bridge to returning to the root and recovering life, the essential element of reversion.\n\nSpeaking of practice, it lies solely in the interdependence of the body’s breath and the mind’s rest, thereby attaining great samadhi. The essentials of emptiness and stillness were revealed by the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, and *Liezi*, and later generations of true immortals inherited and expounded upon them.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Four Hundred Words* states: *“Emptiness gives birth to white snow; stillness sprouts the yellow sprout.”*\n\nLi Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* says: *“In learning immortality, emptiness and stillness are the essence of the elixir.”* He also says: *“Emptiness reaches its extreme, and primordial qi congeals; stillness reaches its depth, and yang returns.”* And: *“Gathering lead relies on emptiness and non-action; advancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows. All reduction and augmentation depend on emptiness; shattering emptiness itself achieves great awakening.”*\n\nMaster Boyang’s *Triple Concordance* states: *“Inwardly nurture the self with tranquility and emptiness.”*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Examination and Commentary on the Triple Concordance* says: *“Tranquility and emptiness—these four words are the essential secret of nurturing the self. A thousand sages and ten thousand perfected ones share this single principle. The *Laozi* says: ‘Attain the extreme of emptiness; guard stillness firmly. The ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return.’ Master Sima’s *On Sitting in Forgetfulness* states: ‘When the mind is at peace and empty, the Dao naturally comes to reside.’ Man is born still—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, it becomes desire. Once there is desire, the ears are seduced by sounds, the eyes seized by colors, and the mouth spoiled by flavors. The true nature is lost, and primordial essence and primordial qi are thereby depleted, and one’s life follows. Thus, nurturing the self takes tranquility and emptiness as its foundation. Tranquility and emptiness mean: Do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence. Not a single thought arises, and the ten thousand conditions are all empty. The mind is like the Great Void, not clinging to a single thing. Master Xu Jing said: ‘To keep the spirit within the mind from departing, do not allow a single thing to remain in the numinous terrace. If things reside in the mind, the spirit is not clear, and true essence is dissipated, harming the sinews and bones.’ If scholars can thoroughly investigate the original state and turn their light inward to illuminate it, they will know that within clarity and stillness, not a single thing exists—and that so-called tranquility and emptiness are attained within oneself.”*\n\nFloating Hill Immortal Ancestor says: *“Resolving to return primordial essence to qi is the beginning; in the midst of emptiness and stillness, one obtains the cloud ladder.”*\n\nAncestor Lü says: *“Primordial qi is the true mystery; within the mystery lies the mysterious mechanism, which requires stillness and focus.”* He also says: *“Each explores the mysterious mechanism within stillness; in stillness’s subtlety, one attains the profound and wondrous.”*\n\nThe secret says: The initial practice of the profound tradition is to concentrate the spirit in emptiness—this is the essential meaning of an empty mind. When breath harmonizes with the mind, it is the true secret of still qi. When breath is regulated and the mind is concentrated, one attains great samadhi. Body and mind become profoundly still, unchanging and unmoving, utterly like the Great Void—thus, the principle of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness is realized.\n\nFloating Hill Ancestor says: *“Wisdom arises from samadhi; samadhi is attained through stillness. The true meaning of stillness is difficult to fathom. Testing within emptiness, stillness is not samadhi. Movement captures the numinous mechanism; clinging is not the profound. The stillness within the profound—its subtlety is hard to express.”*\n\nAs a mirror facing objects reveals their forms—\nknow that the mirror itself holds no such forms.\nHow then do forms appear?\nSeek forms apart from the mirror, and they vanish;\nmove the mirror to reflect, and forms reappear.\nThis mirror or that mirror—do they show two forms?\nThis form or that form—none abide as form.\nIn the stillness of the profound, contemplate thus.\n\nAs a river’s limpid pool reflects the moon—\nbefore the moon ascends, the deep holds no moon;\nwhen the moon hangs aloft, water and sky share one moon.\nThe moon in water, the moon in sky—are there two moons?\nScoop water to seize the moon, and it is gone;\nshift the river to view the moon, and it remains the same.\nKnow that every river holds no moon of its own.\nIn the stillness of the profound, contemplate thus.\n\nAs plum blossoms at the valley’s mouth unfurl their canopies toward the sun—\nwhile still in bud, they already harbor the yang mechanism.\nWere it not for the biting cold, qi would not congeal and quicken.\nEven with the return of early yang, without a foundation, it would dissipate or vanish,\nebbing and flowing in accord with creation’s rhythm.\nThe path into stillness, the profound’s hidden realm.\n\nAs a lotus rises from water, standing tall to bear the dew—\na single round pearl congeals at the flower’s heart.\nCrush it, and it shatters into countless pearls.\nWhen dew first scatters, each drop becomes a pearl.\nWho would know that, when split, every drop forms a pearl?\nWhen the lotus first blooms, it holds within yet does not unfurl;\nwhen the lotus leaves scatter, they do not cling to the pistils.\nOnly by not clinging does the numinous manifest as pearls.\nThe wondrous aspect of stillness, the profound’s essential pivot.\nWords struggle to convey it—here, a glimpse of heaven’s mechanism is revealed.\n\nThis chapter expounds the profound tradition’s principle of emptiness and stillness, its subtlety beyond compare. Know that the stillness of the profound tradition is the stillness of both body and mind—unattached and vast, roundly illuminating and thoroughly penetrating, like the light of a mirror or the moon in water. When both are still, not even the finest dust arises; when both illuminate, one enters layer upon layer. Like the lotus bearing dew, each drop forms a pearl—separation and union are unobstructed. Only by not clinging or abiding does this wondrous aspect appear. The profound tradition does not depart from emptiness and stillness, nor does it dwell in the subtlety of emptiness and stillness—it is thus, and this is called the Great Profound.\n\nThe principle of emptiness and stillness in Buddhism is known as *śamatha*. The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: “If all bodhisattvas awaken to pure perfect enlightenment, and with a still, awakened mind take stillness as their practice, by clarifying all thoughts, they recognize the disturbance of discriminating consciousness. Still wisdom arises, and the adventitious dust of body and mind is forever extinguished. Thereupon, inner tranquility and light ease emerge. Through this tranquility, the hearts of all tathāgatas in the ten directions manifest within, like images in a mirror. This expedient means is called *śamatha*.” It further states: “If all bodhisattvas take only supreme stillness, by the power of stillness they forever sever afflictions and ultimately attain accomplishment. Without rising from their seats, they enter nirvana. Such bodhisattvas are called those who cultivate *śamatha* alone.” The *Avataṃsaka Sutra’s* “Chapter on the Ten Samādhis” states: “Abiding in *śamatha*, most tranquil, ever dwelling in the one mark—namely, the markless.”\n\nThe stillness of the profound tradition is precisely entered through *śamatha*, transcending a single gate to emerge upon the adorned path, sharing the same enjoyment as all buddhas and bodhisattvas. Layman Pang said: “In stillness, one sees the true suchness of nature.” The *Classic of the Unseen* states: “The Dao of nature is still,” and “Supreme stillness is the essence of integrity.” *Zhuangzi* says: “Rectitude leads to stillness; stillness arises from clarity; clarity leads to non-action, yet nothing is left undone.” Thus, both immortals and buddhas cultivate through emptiness and stillness to return to their original nature, aligning with the true and constant Dao.\n\n---\n\n62. The Purity of the Infant\n\nLaozi said: “Carrying your *po* and embracing the One—can you never part from it? Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?” This teaches one to unite mind and breath, harmonizing qi and breath, sleeping without sound, just like an infant. He further said: “The multitude bustle about, as if feasting at a great sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace. I alone remain tranquil, showing no sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.” And again: “One whose virtue is profoundly accumulated is like a newborn babe. Poisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm. It does not know the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—this is the perfection of essence. It cries all day without its throat becoming hoarse—this is the perfection of harmony.”\n\nLaozi repeatedly teaches one to emulate the infant, for it holds a profound meaning. First, the infant has no cunning mind, free from distinctions of right and wrong, high and low, great and small. Second, the infant is supple and soft—Laozi’s words: “In human life, one is soft and weak; in death, one is stiff and strong. The soft and weak are companions of life; the stiff and strong are companions of death.” Third, the infant does not contend—Laozi said: “The Dao of the sage is to act without contending,” and “Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.” The virtue of non-contention is emphasized three times in the *Five Thousand Words*. Fourth, the infant has no lustful desires, seeing form yet not as form, pure and serene. Fifth, the infant embraces the One, guarding only spirit and qi, harmonizing mind and breath, sleeping at night without sound, able to resonate with heaven and earth’s true yang. Those who study the Dao should be like this. Sixth, the infant has no sense of self or others, no clinging mind, muddled and unaware, forgetting things and cares, knowing only to eat when hungry and sleep when tired. Those who embody the Dao must be thus. Therefore, the virtues of the infant are held up for emulation.\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into Laozi* states: “The ancients who cultivated the self concealed and accumulated virtue, deep and unexposed, thus they were often compared to newborn babes.”\n\nThe sutra states: *\"Carrying the soul and embracing the One.\"* Profit and harm do not intrude, thus venomous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and predatory birds do not strike. Since the mind harbors no scheming, external things do not respond with scheming intent. Moreover, though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grip remains firm—why? Because the essence is perfect. When essence is whole, qi naturally concentrates, thus the grip is firm, and the mechanism operates in due time, without command yet spontaneously. Though crying all day, the throat does not grow hoarse—why? Because harmony is perfect. When qi is harmonious, the voice remains rounded. Yet know this: the harmony of qi arises from the spirit remaining unharmed. Excessive joy, fear, sorrow, or anger—if one cries thus, the spirit and qi are both injured before the day is done. When essence and harmony converge, this is the virtue of the infant. Those who embody profound virtue are likewise. Therefore, constantly embrace the primordial and guard the One, concentrate qi to utmost softness, so that one’s harmonious qi flows in communion with heaven and earth. Then the root of nature remains whole, the stem of life secure, and the unchanging Dao of true constancy resides within.\n\n*The Precious Mirror Samādhi of the Cave School* states: *\"Like a worldly infant, the five aspects complete. Neither going nor coming, neither arising nor abiding. Gentle and harmonious, with phrases yet without phrases.\"*\n\nMaster Yuanwu said: *\"Whether form or fragrance, all is penetrated at once—only then is it called the realm of no-mind. Cultivate until resembling an infant: pure harmony and tranquil simplicity. Though amidst worldly toil, worldly dust does not stain. Though dwelling in serene wonder, serenity cannot hold one back. In movement and action, all is effortlessly free. Roots, dust, birth, death—realm and wisdom are empty and wondrous. Like hot water melting snow, one always knows the time, without excess—this is the person of no-mind.\"*\n\nAfter the *Sage Conduct* and *Brahmā Conduct* chapters in the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, the *Infant Conduct Chapter* follows, stating: *\"Good son, why is it called infant conduct? The good son cannot arise, abide, come, go, or speak—this is infant conduct. The Tathāgata is likewise: ‘Cannot arise’ means the Tathāgata never arises in the marks of dharmas. ‘Cannot abide’ means the Tathāgata does not cling to any dharmas. ‘Cannot come’ means the Tathāgata’s bodily actions are without movement. ‘Cannot go’ means the Tathāgata has reached great nirvāṇa. ‘Cannot speak’ means though the Tathāgata expounds dharmas for all beings, in truth nothing is said. Further, the infant does not know suffering or joy, day or night, father or mother. The bodhisattva mahāsattva is likewise: for the sake of beings, they do not perceive suffering or joy, have no marks of day or night, and toward all beings, their mind is equal—thus they have no marks of father, mother, intimacy, or estrangement, serving as an analogy for the Tathāgata’s conduct. Further, the infant cannot undertake great or small affairs; the bodhisattva mahāsattva is likewise, no longer creating karmic actions in saṃsāra—this is called ‘not creating.’\"* The sutra extensively illustrates the marks of infant conduct to analogize the Tathāgata’s conduct, perfectly aligning with the Lao Sage’s principle of returning to the infant.\n\nThe Mystic School’s teaching of reverting to the child’s body is precisely the practice of returning to the infant. After seven days passing the great kalpa of heaven, the roots of lust, the mind of lust, and the mechanism of lust are all uprooted, restoring primordial purity—thus attaining the Dao becomes effortless. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s ten abodes include the *Abode of Primordial Purity*. Mañjuśrī, the teacher of seven buddhas, is uniquely called the *Bodhisattva Youth*—this too shares the same principle.\n\n*The Meaning of Mahāyāna* states: *\"Infant conduct has two types. Regarding self-benefit, it is named by analogy: conduct free from discrimination, like an infant who accomplishes nothing—this is infant conduct. Regarding benefiting others, it is named for those being transformed: as the sutra says, ordinary beings, śrāvakas, and beginning bodhisattvas resemble infants; transforming these infants is called infant conduct.\"*\n\nBoth the immortal and buddha traditions use the infant to illustrate the cultivator’s practice. However, the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* shows the marks but not the practice. The Lao Sage not only demonstrates returning to the infant but also reveals the principle of concentrating qi to softness and embracing the One without departure—comprehension, understanding, practice, and realization are all complete. Truly, this is the guiding principle of profound cultivation and the precious raft for transcending birth and death.\n\n---\n\n**Sixty-Three: The Virtue of Primal Chaos**\n\nPrimal chaos is the state before yin and yang separate, before black and white divide—a realm of seamless indistinction, where function is forgotten in wondrous perfection. In the Dao, it is the *Great Mystery*, the *Ultimateless*, the *Chaotic Darkness*, the *Prior to the Emperor of Images*. In Buddhism, it is *Before the Sound of Might*; in Confucianism, the *Great Ease*. According to Dongshan’s five ranks of merit, it is the *Merit of Merit*; in the five ranks of correct and partial, it is the *Position of Simultaneous Middle Arrival*. Principle and phenomena merge without trace—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\n\nThus Dongshan said: *\"Seamless, with no need for concealment—beyond this, nothing to seek.\"* Caoshan said: *\"Seamless, without inside or outside, harmonious and level above and below.\"* And again: *\"Seamless, concealing principle and phenomena—its signs are utterly obscure. Before the King of Might’s sound, how could Maitreya awaken?\"* Dongshan’s verse states: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—who dares harmonize without falling into being or non-being? Everyone wishes to escape the common stream, yet in the end, they fold back and sit in the ashes.\"*\n\nMaster Lu’s verse says: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—the tongueless child truly knows the Dao. Where to brush away dust to meet the source? Letting go and returning, the path regains its wonder.\"*\n\nHongzhi said: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—the Dipper’s handle slants, the sky not yet dawn. The crane’s dream awakens to dew on leaves, cold; from the old nest, it flies into the clouds and pines.\"*\n\nHui of Zide’s verse says: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—where white clouds part, the home mountain is fine. Shattering the Black Dragon’s luminous moon-pearl, Kunlun sinks into the sea without a trace.\"*\n\nMaster Daming Bin says: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—when skill is exhausted and effort forgotten, it is no mere cleverness. The withered tree’s dragon-song brings spring to the great earth; the numinous root sprouts from the cold cliff’s grass.\"*\n\nYu Shan’s verse states: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—when brightness and darkness are spent, light does not shine. The stone maiden’s wisdom is wondrously inexhaustible; she plants rootless grass atop the sheer peak.\"*\n\nXueya Man’s verse says: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—towering where the Three Lights have never shone. Striking empty space with dream-hands, few hear; lofty, it does not fall into the tones of gong or shang.\"*\n\nAmong Dongshan’s Five Positions, this alone is the most supreme and most profound. This position leaves no trace to follow, no image to liken. Neither bright nor dark, neither form nor emptiness, neither upright nor biased—both merit and position are concealed, both phenomena and principle wholly dissolved. It is precisely the state Zhuangzi called *\"returning to the One without trace.\"*\n\nJiu Feng Yu says: *\"Though dust holds arts of concealment, how can they compare to entering the imperial realm with one’s whole being?\"*\n\nThe Old Sage said: *\"I alone drift, unmarked; vast, unending.\"* This is the primal chaos of this position—both Chan and Daoist mysteries esteem it as the ultimate attainment of the Way.\n\nLet us further verify this in the alchemical classics. Zi Yang’s *Four Hundred Characters* states: *\"Chaos embraces emptiness; emptiness encompasses the Three Realms.\"* Master Qianxu says: *\"The Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. All three are contained within emptiness, and chaos envelops them. Chaos is the primordial Wuji. In elixir methods, spirit and qi return to the root, and the Void generates the aperture. That the formless gives rise to numinous substance is ‘emptiness encompassing the Three Realms.’ After shedding the embryo, all return to the Void, to chaos—only then is it called completion. This is ‘chaos embracing emptiness.’\"*\n\nLi Hao’s *Great Elixir Poem* says: *\"Before chaos divided, I alone endured; embracing the Four Images, I established heaven and earth. The Returned Elixir must be sought here—only thus is it the gate of supreme subtlety.\"*\n\nMaster Lü says: *\"Who knows the true secret lies hidden in chaos? The Daoist must first learn to be deaf and dumb.\"* And again: *\"Called ‘rare,’ called ‘remote’—these are the foundation of the Way. Called ‘mysterious,’ called ‘subtle’—these are the apertures of the Way. I reveal to you: within chaos lies the most wondrous.\"* And: *\"Light and dark lodge in the peak of rarity; resplendent, it soars at chaos’s summit.\"* And: *\"Essence enters qi, qi enters spirit; after seven days in chaos, the soul returns.\"*\n\nMaster Ma says: *\"When the Ninefold Mystery’s work reaches the birth of the yang, the Great Ultimate is the root of all qi. The virtuous infant returns to chaos; radiant and profound, it is gradually drawn in.\"* And: *\"When the elixir is complete, why seek the primordial? The wondrous naturalness of the hollow Void. To the end, preserve the luminous ultimate principle—true mechanism lies before chaos divides.\"*\n\nXue Zixian’s *Returning to Life* says: *\"At the first return of qi, the new moon appears; within the crucible, the divine water warms. Hard and soft meet, qi evenly balanced—the wonder lies in not transgressing chaos.\"*\n\nChen Xubai says: *\"Before chaos’s birth, chaos is whole; the message within cannot be transmitted.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan’s *Eulogy* states: *\"Entering chaos’s aperture, I turn the Gate of Mystery. Seizing the talisman of creation, heaven and earth all submit. Hmph! Since riding the crane to heaven, this Way has been unknown for ten thousand ages.\"*\n\nMaster Sansheng’s *Sweeping Light Daoist Song* says: *\"Nature returns to life, life returns to heaven; returning to life, it reverts to chaos’s root.\"* And in his *Golden Elixir Poem*: *\"In the dim vastness where heaven and earth were about to part, in the dark obscurity before father and mother were born. Ingesting it, chaos is like a dream; transformed, the infant lives ten thousand years.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi’s* *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter says: *\"Zigong traveled south to Chu and, returning to Jin, passed through Hanyin. He saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. Zigong asked, ‘What are you doing?’ The man replied, ‘I am a disciple of Confucius.’ The gardener said, ‘Are you not the one who broadly studies to emulate the sages, who struts about to overshadow the masses, who plays the lone lute and sings dirges to sell your name throughout the world? You will forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your body—how can you hope for that? If you cannot govern yourself, how can you govern the world?’ Zigong shrank back, dismayed, and felt uneasy for thirty *li* before recovering. Returning to Lu, he told Confucius. Confucius said, ‘He is one who falsely practices the arts of the Chaos Clan. He knows one but not two, governs the inner but not the outer. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who is inactive and returns to the uncarved, who embodies nature and embraces spirit, wandering among the vulgar—how could you not be startled? Moreover, the arts of the Chaos Clan—how could you or I understand them?’\"*\n\nIn the *\"Letting Be and Governing\"* chapter: *\"Release the heart, free the spirit—silent, without soul. The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. Each returns to its root yet does not know it; muddled, chaotic, they never depart from it. If they knew it, they would depart from it.\"*\n\nIn the *\"Fitting the Potentate\"* chapter: *\"The Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Center was Chaos. Shu and Hu often met in Chaos’s land, and Chaos treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Chaos’s kindness, saying, ‘All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.’\"*\n\nDaily they bored one aperture, and after seven days, Chaos died.\"\n\nThe *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi* conclude with this passage, its purport profound indeed. That Chaos died after seven days signifies that Chaos represents the primordial, boundless state prior to Heaven, beyond the divisions of heart, intent, and discriminating consciousness. When the six roots become active and the six senses scatter, one falls into the posterior realm of perception and knowledge—no longer the *Book of Changes*’ image of \"using the nine, beholding the flock of dragons without a head.\"\n\nMoreover, Shu and Hu are the heart and the breath. When heart and breath unite, one attains great stillness. With stillness prolonged, inner and outer merge and are forgotten, roots and dust both extinguished—this is Chaos. Concealing heart and breath within Chaos is the esoteric teaching of the Mysterious School, the art of returning to the root and restoring the mandate.\n\nThe *Song of Dongshan* says:\n*\"No sooner do horns appear than they are unbearable—\nTo seek the Buddha with the mind brings only shame.\nThrough endless kalpas, none have known,\nWho would inquire of the fifty-three in the south?\"*\n\nThe moment horns appear is when the flock of dragons has a head, when roots and dust arise. The endless kalpas are precisely the primordial, boundless Chaos, the vast primeval mist—timeless, beginningless, without measure or duration. This is the image of \"the flock of dragons without a head\" in the *Book of Changes*, the wondrous proof of Laozi’s return to the boundless.\n\nThe esoteric alchemical arts of the Mysterious School are compiled in the *Triplex Unity*. The *Unity* states:\n*\"Chaos intertwines and binds,\nThe first sprouts plant the root’s foundation.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the union of yin and yang, entering into Chaos. Chaos is the source that generates Heaven, Earth, and humanity, and the foundation of the elixir is planted therein. As Ancestor Lü said: *\"Who knows the true secret hidden in Chaos?\"*\n\nThe *Unity* further states:\n*\"The sage measures and orders the primal foundation.\nThe four (that is, Qian, Kun, Kan, Li—twofold Heaven and Earth, fourfold yin and yang) merge into Chaos,\nDirectly entering the void.\"*\n\nThis describes the fusion of prior and posterior Heaven, the return to the homeland of Chaos, the coagulation in the valley of the void. This Chaos and void are the primal foundation—the mechanism of the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe *Unity* also says:\n*\"Between dark and new moon, the tally aligns at the center.\nChaos and vast obscurity—\nThe female and male follow one another.\nNourishing fluids moisten and enrich,\nBestowing transformation and flowing through.\nThe numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth\nCannot be fathomed.\nUse it to secure the body,\nConceal the form and hide.\"*\n\nThis speaks of Chaos and vast obscurity as the moment when sun and moon conjoin. The sage secures the body therein, washing the heart and retiring into secrecy—like the antelope hanging its horns, leaving no trace. All the spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot plumb its depths; it is most wondrous. This is the pivot of elixir-making, the great furnace of immortal transformation.\n\nThe above briefly cites the alchemical classics and Chan texts of the Mysterious and Zen schools to expound the profundities of Chaos. From the formation of the elixir to the shedding of the embryo, there is no moment, no instant, that is not within Chaos. If scholars can embody and diligently practice this, the Way of return is more than half understood.\n\n---\n\nThe Profundities of the Double Mystery\n\nLaozi’s *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, constantly without desire, observe its mystery;\nConstantly with desire, observe its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name,\nTogether called the Mystery.\nMystery upon mystery—\nThe gateway of the manifold wonders.\"*\n\nThe \"without\" is the Dharma-realm of principle; the \"with\" is the Dharma-realm of phenomena. Through the without, observe the with (the wondrous existent); through the with, observe the without (true emptiness). When with and without interpenetrate, this is the Dharma-realm of unimpeded principle and phenomena—encompassing the four Dharma-realms of the *Avataṃsaka*, in accord with the *Heart Sutra*’s principle of non-duality of form and emptiness, having already entered the gateway of Mahāyāna prajñā.\n\n\"Mystery upon mystery\" reveals the realm of the Double Mystery. Like a thousand lamps in a single chamber, light and shadow layer upon layer, intermingling and interpenetrating, pervading and containing all—matching the *Avataṃsaka* school’s Indra’s Net realm, which is the Dharma-realm of unimpeded phenomena.\n\nThis gateway of the Double Mystery contains the one within the infinite, and the infinite again within the one. The Old Sage merely named it, without disclosing its meaning. If interpreted through the *Avataṃsaka* school’s Ten Profound Principles, the wondrous truth becomes self-evident.\n\nThe Ten Profound Principles are:\n1. The Gate of Simultaneous and Complete Correspondence;\n2. The Gate of Unimpeded Freedom in Vastness and Narrowness;\n3. The Gate of Mutual Containment of the One and the Many;\n4. The Gate of Unimpeded Identity of All Dharmas;\n5. The Gate of Secret and Manifest Co-actualization;\n6. The Gate of Subtle Containment and Bliss;\n7. The Gate of Indra’s Net Realm;\n8. The Gate of Displaying Dharmas through Phenomena to Generate Understanding;\n9. The Gate of the Ten Times Interpenetrating Different Dharmas;\n10. The Gate of the Principal and Companions Perfectly Illuminating All Virtues.\n\nAs expounded in the *Avataṃsaka Suspension of Doubts*, taking the Indra’s Net realm as an example, the *Flower Garland Sutra*’s verse says:\n*\"All the dusts in the Flower Treasury world—\nIn each and every dust, the Dharma-realm is seen.\"*\n\nMaster Qingliang’s commentary states:\n*\"In each and every mote of dust, the boundless realms of lands appear;\nWithin those lands of realms, motes of dust again arise.\nWithin those dusts, realms of lands once more appear—\nLayer upon layer, inexhaustible, beyond the reach of thought and cognition.\nLike the pearl-net in the palace of the Heavenly Emperor,\nWithin a single bright pearl, all images are reflected;\nEach pearl is thus, luminous and clear,\nMutually reflecting shadows, shadows reflecting shadows—endlessly.\nLike mirrors and lamps, light intermingling layer upon layer,\nBuddha upon Buddha, infinite.\"*\n\nBy this standard, the Old Sage’s gateway of the Double Mystery contains wonders within apertures and apertures within wonders. Within these apertures and wonders, each again contains wonders and apertures—layer upon layer, boundless, the mysteries unfathomable.\n\nOne encompasses all, and all encompass one—\nthe one and the many mutually contain each other,\nsimultaneously and perfectly fulfilled.\nThus is it called the gateway of all wonders.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* speaks of \"layered radiance, layered splendor,\"\nwhich shares the same meaning as the Old Sage’s gateway of the Double Mystery.\nYet Confucianism and Daoism merely name it,\nwhile the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* of the Buddha’s tradition\nfully reveals its realm—\nthere is, indeed, a difference in depth and detail.\n\nOver two thousand years, over a hundred scholars have annotated the *Laozi*,\nbut those who could expound the wonder of the Double Mystery\nand use it to illuminate the boundless pearl-net of the *Avataṃsaka*’s Dharmadhātu—\nsuch minds are as rare as morning stars.\nTruly, the difficulty of true insight is evident.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Laozi* by Heshang Gong, though spuriously attributed,\nat least hints at the gateway of the Double Mystery.\nHis annotation reads:\n*\"Mystery (xuan) is Heaven.\nMystery upon mystery (xuan zhi you xuan) means Heaven within Heaven.\"*\nThe Song-dynasty Chan master Yongming Yanshou,\nin his *Record of the Source-Mirror*,\ncited this passage to reveal the wonder of the *Daodejing*.\nYet how lamentable that the Qingliang Chengguan National Preceptor,\nin his *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka*,\nvehemently disparaged the teachings of Laozi,\nequating them with the views of ordinary outsiders,\nand failed to recognize this saying of \"Heaven within Heaven\"\nas proof of the *Avataṃsaka*’s boundless pearl-net of wonders.\nDoes this not contradict the intent of the Third Patriarch Xincan’s teaching:\n*\"Harmonizing the mind in equality,\nall dharmas viewed as one,\nnon-duality all-inclusive,\nnothing left unembraced?\"*\n\n---\n\n**§65 The Subtlety of Double Emptiness**\n\nThe *Daodejing* opens the gateway of the Double Mystery;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) reveals the profundity of Double Emptiness.\nDouble Mystery is the meaning of the *Avataṃsaka*;\nDouble Emptiness is the meaning of *Prajñā*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter states:\n*\"Emerging without origin, entering without aperture.\nThere is reality yet no place to abide,\nthere is extension yet no boundary to sever—\nsomething emerges yet has no aperture.\"*\nThis \"reality\" marks the meaning of true emptiness.\n\nFurther on, it says:\n*\"There is life, there is death,\nthere is emergence, there is entry.\nEntering and emerging without seeing its form—\nthis is called the Heavenly Gate.\nThe Heavenly Gate is non-being;\nall things emerge from non-being.\nBeing cannot generate being from being;\nit must emerge from non-being.\nYet even non-being is not a fixed non-being—\nthe sage abides in this.\"*\nHere, the Heavenly Gate signifies emptiness.\nWhen practice reaches the point where thought and breath both cease,\nperson and dharma are both extinguished,\ninner and outer both empty—\none enters the Heavenly Gate.\nYet if one clings to the trace of emptiness,\neven emptiness becomes something.\nThus, one must empty the appearance of emptiness,\nso that even \"non-being\" is no more—\nthis is the stage of Double Emptiness.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states:\n*\"Emptiness, awareness, and quiescence are perfectly round;\nthe emptiness that empties emptiness is extinguished.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"When this root first awakens,\none first attains emptiness of the person.\nThe nature of emptiness becomes perfectly luminous,\nachieving liberation from dharmas.\nOnce liberated from dharmas,\nboth are empty and unarisen—\nthis is called the samādhi of the bodhisattva,\nattaining the patience of non-arising.\"*\nThis deeply accords with the *Zhuangzi*’s teaching of Double Emptiness.\n\nObserving Laozi’s Double Mystery,\none deeply enters the *Avataṃsaka*’s infinite gateway.\nObserving Zhuangzi’s Double Emptiness,\none deeply accords with the *Prajñā*’s teaching of no-form.\nThus, the subtle words of Laozi and Zhuangzi\nand the mind-essence of the Buddhas\nmerge like water and milk,\nresonating like a seal and its impression—\nthere is no doubt of this.\n\nYet it is strange that the Qingliang Chengguan National Preceptor,\nin his *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka*,\ncondemned Laozi and Zhuangzi as external paths\nand failed to cite the principles of Double Emptiness and Double Mystery\nto mutually illuminate them.\nEven later works like Zhao Yandu’s *Unity of Immortals and Buddhas* (Yuan dynasty)\nand Wu Chongxu’s *Convergence of Immortals and Buddhas* (Ming dynasty)\ncould not employ these principles to achieve fusion.\nThus, the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi have remained obscure in the world for over two thousand years.\n\nDouble Mystery and Double Emptiness\nare the subtle wonders of quiescence and illumination in mutual fusion.\nDouble Mystery is expounded from the side of illumination;\nDouble Emptiness, from the side of quiescence.\n\nThe *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka* states:\n*\"When mind and realm are thusness,\nthey are equal and unimpeded.\nThe Buddha who understands the realm through mind,\nthe Tathāgata who sees only mind in the realm—\nmind and Buddha are layer upon layer,\nyet the nature of original awakening is one.\nAll are grasped yet unattainable—\nthus mind and realm are both forgotten.\nIlluminated yet unfathomable—\nthus principle and wisdom interpenetrate.\"*\nForgetting both is the realization of true emptiness;\ninterpenetration is the manifestation of wondrous being.\nThis is how the Heavenly Gate and the gateway of all wonders are established.\n\nFrom the perspective of perfect fusion:\nLaozi’s teaching reveals that wonder and aperture are one in mystery—\nthus, being is also mystery, and non-being is also mystery.\nEven \"non-being within non-being\" is the gateway of Double Mystery,\nthough here it is spoken from the perspective of the empty Tathāgata-garbha.\nThe *Avataṃsaka*’s Ten Mysteries\nare expounded from the perspective of the non-empty Tathāgata-garbha.\n\nIf a practitioner realizes the one mind\nand thoroughly fathoms the source of dharmas,\nboth the empty and non-empty Tathāgata-garbha are revealed.\nThis is what Qingliang meant by:\n*\"With the mind that knows quiescence as non-dual,\none accords with the Middle Way of empty and being in dual fusion.\"*\n\nSomeone may ask:\nIs there a sequence between Double Mystery and Double Emptiness?\n\nThe answer:\nQingliang said:\n*\"When both are forgotten in realization,\nwondrous awakening becomes perfectly luminous.\"*\nThus, only when one accords with Double Emptiness\ndoes the gateway of Double Mystery open.\nThen, the large appears within the small,\nthe small appears within the large—\nwondrous functions layer upon layer,\ndeeply entering the *Avataṃsaka*’s infinite gateway.\n\n---\n\n**§66 The Path of the Bird**\n\nA bird flies through the sky without leaving a trace—\nthis is called the path of the bird.\nZhuangzi called it the \"bird’s flight.\"\n\nWhen mind and breath depend on emptiness,\nsettle in emptiness,\nand forget in emptiness,\nnot clinging to the bodily form—\nis this not the wondrous practice of the bird’s path?\n\nThus, Li Qing’an’s *Song of Cultivating Emptiness* says:\n*\"Within emptiness, the spirit is at peace, within emptiness it moves.\nThe hidden emptiness—heaven and earth all return to it.\"*\n\n**§66 The Path of the Bird (continued)**\n\nZen Master Zuan of Zu’an said:\n*\"The wondrous, empty bird’s path leaves no speck of dust;\njade halls stand vacant, locked in emerald moss.\nA shuttle hangs on the wall—autumn sheds its bones;\nthe old oyster in the deep sea broods by day.\"*\n\nZen Master Jue of Tiantong said:\n*\"Sandbirds roost at night in trees by the blue shore;\nstone shoots pierce fresh through the moss of ancient paths.\nDo not say the leviathan lacks wings—\ntoday it returns along the bird’s path.\"*\n\nA monk asked Zen Master Jia of Dongshan, *\"The Master often teaches people to walk the bird’s path. What is the bird’s path?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Not encountering a single person.\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"How does one walk it?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Simply go with no selfishness in your step.\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"Is walking the bird’s path itself the original face?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Why is the Venerable so confused?\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"How am I confused?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"If you were not confused, why would you call a servant ‘master’?\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"What is the original face?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Not walking the bird’s path.\"*\n\nZen Master Hong of Li’an said:\n*\"Not walking the bird’s path—only then is it the original face.\nWhy, then, does one usually teach people to walk the bird’s path?\nI ask: What did Dongshan mean?\"*\nAfter a long pause, he said:\n*\"To cross the river, one needs a raft;\nonly upon reaching the shore does one leave the boat.\"*\n\nZen Master Qi of Fengshan said:\n*\"I ask: What is the face of not walking the bird’s path?\"*\nAfter a long pause, he said:\n*\"I would not refuse to tell you,\nbut to continue it is most difficult.\"*\n\nZen Master Chun of Danxia said:\n*\"The ancient path leans freely on the great void;\nwalking it is still to tread rough terrain.\nNot ascending the bird’s path may be wondrous,\nbut upon examination, one still traverses the way.\"*\n\nZen Master Zhi of Moli said:\n*\"Not walking the bird’s path—\nthe imperial wind blows vast.\nWhat does the old nag know?\nDrunk in the celestial streets,\n‘What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?’\"*\n\nZen Master Jue of Tiantong said:\n*\"The six gates open freely, the path is not lost;\nin the light of the great sun, one does not seize the moment.\nEven if one models wondrous display without selfish intent,\njust so does one return along the bird’s path.\"*\n\nI note: Walking the bird’s path is returning home by way. Not walking the bird’s path is sitting steadily at home. Walking the bird’s path remains within the stage of merit; not walking the bird’s path is the stage beyond merit and its fruition.\n\nWhen a practitioner first cultivates merit, mind and breath are placed in the emptiness outside the body, interdependent and continuous as if present—spirit harmonized, qi settled, naturally attuned. This is the stage of merit. When merit is pure and effort exhausted, suddenly spirit and breath are both forgotten, entering great stillness. Mind and realm are both quiescent, person and dharma both empty, inner and outer both dissolved—only then does one enter the original position.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"the six gates open freely\"*? The six senses enter deep stillness, the six consciousnesses do not arise—this is precisely the moment of turning merit into position. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the first yang returns; in the midst of vagueness, a transformation occurs in the profound darkness. One must swiftly turn the mysterious pass, so that mind and breath again interdepend outside—this is turning position into merit. Depending thus, one enters stillness again, neither exiting nor entering, forgetting form and image, thereby entering the samādhi of no-mind. Detached from the body, without reliance—this is again turning merit into position.\n\nIn this process, whether walking or stopping, one does not miss the moment. Within this turning wheel, all is the subtle mechanism of the bird’s path. Only when one reaches Zhuangzi’s *\"realm of no walking\"* is one truly on the path; only when one attains the level of *\"shattering empty space\"* is one fully transcendent.\n\n---\n\n**§67 The Sign of the Sparrow’s Egg**\n\nLongmeizi’s *Poem Verifying the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"Like a sparrow’s egg, round and full,\nor a black pearl, perfectly spherical.\nThe dragon child, having shed its skin, is swallowed—\nthis body has already attained the immortal who walks on land.\"*\n\nShangyangzi said:\n*\"When the medicine enters the mouth, one circulates one’s true fire to nurture it. While circulating the fire, one suddenly feels the true qi at the spine rising to strike the mud-pill palace, with a trickling sound, as if something touches the brain. Momentarily, like sparrow’s eggs, one by one, it enters the throat below the tower, cool as ice, sweet as cream, incomparably fragrant and delicious. When one perceives this state, it is the verification of the golden liquid returning elixir. Thereafter, it is unceasing. Closing the eyes to inwardly observe the viscera, they are as clear as if illuminated by a candle. Gradually, a golden light envelops the body.\"*\n\nZiyang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The maiden passes through the southern garden,\nholding a jade olive in her hand.\"*\n\nZhuokuiyun’s *Direct Explanation* says:\n*\"‘Jade’ symbolizes its whiteness; ‘olive’ symbolizes its neither-square-nor-round shape.\"*\n\nThis is a vivid and precise inner vision, imbued with profound meaning by the immortals.\n\nNiniuweng said:\n*\"The three yangs’ maiden plays with bright pendants.\"*\n\nZixianweng said:\n*\"It is also like a golden silkworm or a jade shoot.\"*\n\nTheir meanings are the same.\n\nI note: The jade shoot, jade olive, bright pendants, and sparrow’s eggs are all inner visions of obtaining the elixir. Where jade is hidden in the mountains, peaks become elegant and waters graceful, and plants and trees do not wither. When the elixir is formed within the body, the body radiates luster, bones become like fine jade, form is transformed and substance altered, the turbid becomes pure, the coarse becomes wondrous—attaining the Dao and becoming a true one is not difficult.\n\nThis sparrow’s egg and jade shoot are the primordial qi, refined by the fire of samādhi, coalescing into this form. They have appearance but no substance—merely a mass of original yang’s luminous qi. Even if one were to dissect the physical body, there would still be nothing. For the primordial qi is subtle and wondrous beyond compare. Only when the practitioner, in samādhi, observes with the eye of wisdom can it be seen—it is never visible to the ordinary eye.\n\n---\n\n**§68 The Auspice of the Red Sun**\n\nWhen the great elixir first congeals, the image of a red sun suspended in the sky appears before one’s eyes.\n\nWhen the elixir congeals within, its symbolic manifestation appears without—only the cultivator perceives it, while others cannot. Master Kebao of Zhenshan said: *\"It is neither green nor white, a single luminous pearl, wholly crimson.\"* Master Chunyang remarked: *\"In the midst of the indistinct, something is seen—its form like the sun’s wheel, radiant and towering.\"* He also said: *\"Rosy light illumines the winding stream, the red sun emerges from Kunlun.\"* Master Sanfeng declared: *\"Within the body, true lead naturally appears—a single red glow bright as the moon.\"* And again: *\"All myriad visions are not of its kind; this single red glow is the supreme truth. This red glow is the breath of spring, within it a gleam like dust on a bright window. Suspended at its center is the primordial medicine—from afar like a grape, up close like gold.\"*\n\nThe *Wugen Shu* (\"Rootless Tree\") states: *\"Rootless tree, its blossoms crimson bright—pluck all the red flowers, and the tree stands empty.\"* And again: *\"Like a ruby orange, like a pellet shot, guard and tend it, never let it stray.\"* Patriarch Hanxu commented: *\"The red is the symbolic manifestation of the great medicine. The immortal masters’ verses on the Daoist sentiment and the Rootless Tree are both essential works—from one, the other may be understood. When the red glow appears, its blossom is truly crimson. When the red blossom is grasped, the true medicine is obtained. Apart from this red blossom, no medicine can be gathered. Once the great elixir matures, this red blossom transforms into a purple hue, becoming purple light and purple qi.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang’s Daoist name, Ziyang (\"Purple Yang\"), alludes to this very symbolic manifestation. When the Old Sage was about to emerge from seclusion, Guan Yin instructed him to observe the celestial signs at night. From afar, he saw purple qi approaching from the east and knew that a great sage would pass through at dawn—soon after, the Old Sage indeed arrived. When Patriarch Lü wandered to Huanglong Mountain, he saw purple clouds forming a canopy and knew a sage dwelled there. Upon entering, he met Chan Master Huanglong Huiji ascending the hall, and through his words, Lü attained sudden awakening, completing the final step.\n\nNote that red is the precursor to purple, and purple is the ultimate transformation of red. Among the seven colors of light, purple is supreme. When the sage’s cultivation reaches the perfection of the great elixir, purple qi appears above the crown—elevated yet another level beyond the red glow of the elixir’s initial congealment. Thus, the *Four Hundred Characters* states: *\"Lead and mercury bind into cinnabar, its radiance a resplendent purple-gold.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Its color shifts further to purple, blazing forth as the returned elixir.\"* Master Sanfeng also said: *\"The two qi harmonize, transmuting into purple light.\"*\n\nIn the esoteric Buddhist text *Ekākṣara-Uṣṇīṣa-Cakra-Kālacakra-Sthāna-Vidhi*, it is written: *\"There, the Bhagavān, with the light of self-nature wisdom, forms the wheel of majestic solar radiance, illuminating all realms without remainder.\"* And again: *\"Again, behold the golden wheel, adorning the sun-wheel of the heart.\"* When the great elixir of the Daoist mystery school first congeals, the auspicious sign of a red sun suspended in the sky appears—is this not the purport of the heart’s adorned sun-wheel? Otherwise, what meaning could be drawn from the doctrine of the great solar wheel? Know that the golden wheel of Buddhism and the golden elixir of the mystery school are both inner-realized symbolic manifestations—there is no doubt of this.\n\n**§69 The Fragrance of Sweet Dew**\n\nThe Old Sage said: *\"When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends.\"* Master Ziyang remarked: *\"When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li intersect.\"* Patriarch Lü said: *\"White clouds ascend to the celestial gate, sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\"* And again: *\"Drive the green dragon, seize the white tiger, summon auspicious winds and descending sweet dew.\"* Master Yuchan declared: *\"When the magic fungus blooms, sweet dew descends; the tortoise and serpent eternally entwine.\"* Longmeizi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* states: *\"Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand beings; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: *\"I do not envy the beauty of delicate flowers, only await the sweet dew and nectarous spring.\"* And again: *\"The fragrance of sweet dew arises, sweet as honey; entering the jade pool, it transforms into golden liquid. Carefree, I drink the sweet dew as it falls.\"* And: *\"From the Niwan Palace descends ambrosial su, like a ruby orange brewing the wine of *tihu*. The *tihu* reaches the mouth like sweet dew.\"* And: *\"Primordial qi, the mist of supreme simplicity—one draught of *tihu* preserves the countenance.\"* And: *\"Daily, the *tihu* wine of longevity; hourly, swallowing the nectar that revives the soul.\"* And: *\"The *tihu* poured upon the crown is the true bellows and key, gathering the primordial qi of the One.\"* And: *\"Transformed into jade nectar, swallowed into the belly—like a mute tasting honey, beyond words.\"* And: *\"Drink the immortal wine of extended years, consume the jade nectar of renewed life.\"*\n\nMaster Niyuan’s *Purple Court Classic* states: *\"Gather and ingest it in an instant—a single white pulse surges through the Niwan. Transformed into jade liquid, it flows into the mouth, its fragrance and cool sweetness suffusing the tongue.\"* The *Cantong Qi* also says: *\"First, the golden blossom arises; in a moment, it dissolves into water, its horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.\"* And: *\"The three substances mutually embrace, their transformations wondrous as spirits. Below lies the qi of the great yang, steaming and seething in an instant. First liquid, then congealing, it is called the Yellow Chariot.\"* And again: *\"Transformed into white liquid, congealing into firmness.\"*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Oral Exegesis* states: *\"Now, the primordial water-metal first arises at the moment of hexagramic movement—merely a single qi. In a brief span, half a watch, it crosses the Magpie Bridge, turns at Kunlun, dissolves into water, and is named *tihu* and sweet dew. Descending through the double towers, falling into the yellow palace, binding into the elixir, it takes the form of horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.\"* He also commented on Patriarch Lü’s *Hundred-Character Stele*: *\"The primordial qi is born at the time of hexagramic movement.\"*\n\nAt this moment, wielding the sword to pursue it, it crosses the Magpie Bridge, pierces the *weilü*, ascends along the Governing Vessel, and reaches the *Niwan*. One suddenly feels a smooth, billowing sensation, as if white clouds were ascending to the upper palace. In an instant, it transforms into jade nectar, its taste like sweet dew, sprinkling upon Mount Sumeru, descending through the double towers, entering the Central Palace—this is what is meant by \"qi returning and the elixir congealing,\" and such is its manifestation. It is also said: \"When qi transforms into water, nothing is as sweet and fine, hence the names *jade liquid* and *fine wine* are given as fitting.\" The above excerpts from the poems, words, and exegeses of ancient adepts illustrate the effects of the Daoist ancestral practice of qi circulating through the *zhou tian*.\n\nFor *tihu* and sweet dew, *jade liquid* and *fine wine*, are all transformations of the primordial, harmonious qi, serving as proof of \"Heaven’s One generating water\" and the meditative flavor of qi circulating through the *zhou tian*—this is called \"ingesting the Great Harmony.\" From this, the hundred vessels thaw like spring, the Three Fields are moistened, essence and qi fill the interior, and spirit-light radiates outward, until qi is full, fire ceases, and the Returned Elixir congeals.\n\n---\n\n**Seventy: The Strangeness of White Blood**\nIn the Daoist ancestral practice of return, after seven days and the completion of the great *zhou tian*, the blood throughout the body gradually transforms into white milk, presenting the phenomenon of \"shedding the old and renewing the crucible.\" Patriarch Lü said: \"Red blood changes, and white milk flows.\" He also said: \"Blood transforms into white cream, and the body becomes indestructible.\" Chen Cuixu stated: \"Though the toil lasts but ten months, gradually gathering and congealing, now the whole body is white blood, and one feels the four limbs free of cold and heat.\" Another poem reads: \"Golden light permeates the body, the marrow fragrant, sinews of gold and bones of jade—pure yang. Refining causes red blood to turn white, yin qi dissipates, and the body is naturally healthy.\" The Perfected One of True Yang said: \"Sometimes blood transforms into milk, and one gradually comes to loathe the rank and foul.\" The *Song of Breaking Delusion and Upholding the True Dao* also states: \"Blood turns to cream, the body like silver; truly, for a hundred days there is no loss, and jade cream flows, generating radiance.\"\n\nZhang Sanfeng’s *Explanation of the Verifications of Return* says: \"After six months of refinement, the body becomes like silver cream, blood transforms into white nectar, the whole body exudes a fragrant aroma, and the breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the maturation of the numinous elixir—a lump of dry mercury. One who ingests it will never die.\"\n\nI note that in modern times, with the flourishing of science, when human blood is observed under a microscope, it is found to contain two kinds of blood cells: red and white. The proportion of white blood cells is small, but their function is immense—they eliminate pathogens, resist cold, nourish the five viscera, and strengthen the body. Daoist ancestral practitioners, in stillness pushed to its extreme, sense the primordial True One’s qi entering their bodies, altering the composition of the blood and increasing the white blood cells. At its utmost, the red blood cells are entirely transformed into white, and thus blood becomes milk. This is the way of nurturing life through the primordial, beyond what those who focus solely on postnatal hygiene can attain.\n\nThat blood transforms into milk is merely a change within the physical body. The sensation of the four limbs being free of cold and heat indicates that the seventh consciousness has also been transformed. As body and mind subtly shift, these are all verifications of the Daoist ancestral methods of qi transforming and spirit transforming, possessing the effortless efficacy of \"water flowing to form a channel\"—this is the way of \"externally transforming the body.\"\n\nSome may ask: In Daoist ancestral cultivation and verification, blood transforming into milk is indeed so. But what of the Buddhist tradition? The answer is: If one attains the great stillness of no-breathing, within that stillness the primordial True One’s qi steams and suffuses the hundred vessels, irrigating the whole body—vast and boundless!—merging with the Great Nature. The Great Harmony overflows, shedding the old and renewing the crucible, and the blood naturally changes, yin exhausted and yang pure.\n\nIn the Chan tradition, when the twenty-fourth patriarch of the Western Heaven, the Venerable Lion, was killed by the king, white milk surged upward several feet. During the Zhou Emperor Wu’s suppression of Buddhism, the Dharma Master Jing’ai, having exhausted his efforts to remonstrate, entered the Zhongnan Mountains. Weeping for seven days, he sat upon a boulder, drew his blade, and sliced open his flesh, hanging his intestines and stomach upon a pine branch. Holding his heart, he died, and white milk flowed beside him, congealing upon the stone. These events are recorded in the classics and are clearly verifiable. They are all evident proofs of blood transforming into milk. Since the verifications of the physical body align, the states of the Dharma-body’s samādhi and wisdom are likewise equivalent—there can be no doubt.\n\n---\n\n**Seventy-One: The Wonder of Square Pupils**\nFormerly, the Queen Mother of the West said to Emperor Wu of Han: \"The practice of *benefiting and transforming* means constantly contemplating the *Numinous Treasure*. *Numinous* is spirit, and *Treasure* is essence. You need only cherish essence, hold it firmly, regulate the mind, and nurture qi. Qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into spirit. Practicing without weariness, spirit and essence become abundant. In one year, qi is transformed; in two years, blood; in three years, essence; in four years, the vessels; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the bones; in seven years, the sinews; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the body. When the body is transformed, the way of change and transformation is complete.\"\n\nThe way of externally transforming the body is what Daoist practice esteems, yet its verifications must arise gradually. First, qi is transformed, and last, the body. The sign of the body’s transformation lies in the transformation of the pupils. When the pupils transform, qi, blood, bones, and marrow are all transformed without exception.\n\nThe *Six Books* states: \"Humans receive qi to live, and the eyes are the first. Where spirit gathers, there are none but the eyes.\" Now, in practicing the way of *benefiting and transforming*, reversing the flow to be born beyond life and death, the pupils, which were last to transform, become square. Thus, square pupils are the culmination of bodily transformation and the symbolic verification of attaining the Dao.\n\nThe saying that immortals have square pupils was spoken of by Liu Xiang and Ge Hong in earlier times, and recounted by Su Shi and Song Lian in later times.\n\nLiu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: \"Wo Quan favored eating pine nuts, his body grew hair several inches long, and his two pupils became square. He could fly and chase galloping horses. He once gifted pine nuts to Emperor Yao, who had no time to consume them.\" The eulogy reads: \"Wo Quan fed on pine, his form transcended, his pupils squared. His feet trod phoenixes, his stride outran swift steeds. To Yao’s gate he bestowed this divine formula—those who fulfill their nature may refuse it, while those of middling wisdom should embrace it.\" This is the earliest record of square pupils.\n\nGe Hong’s *On Immortals* in the *Baopuzi* states: \"If all were like those who verify it, they would have heard of the pupils’ perfect squareness.\" The *Subtle Principles* further says: \"If my eyes had square pupils and my ears extended beyond my crown, I would ride flying dragons and harness auspicious clouds, soaring past lightning to reach the inverted heavens—how then could you question me?\" The *Dispelling Doubts* chapter notes: \"The *Immortals’ Classics* say that the pupils of immortals are all square. In Luoyang, I met Bai Zhongli, who told me his pupils were perfectly square—truly, he was an extraordinary man.\"\n\nIn the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, volume ten of the *Biography of Li Gen*, it is written: \"Tai Wen also said that Li Gen’s two pupils were square. According to the *Immortals’ Classics*, those who live eight hundred years have square pupils.\"\n\nI once asked Master Wang why the pupils of immortals become square. He replied: \"It is the work of divine spirit. This transformation occurs only after refining the spirit to return to emptiness. Such is the verification of spiritual transformation, manifest in the eyes. The human spirit resides in the eyes, as the *Classic of Yin Convergence* says: 'The mechanism lies in the eyes.' If the heart-ground is opened and unobstructed, the eyes too will transform.\" I believe the eyes and heart are interconnected—if the heart remains unmoved as a mountain, the round pupils will turn square. Roundness is the image of movement; squareness, the image of stillness. The *Book of Changes*, in the second line of the *Kun* hexagram, speaks of \"straight, square, and great\"—this can serve as proof. Square pupils are the auspicious sign of immortals, the verification of spiritual transformation, and the culmination of bodily refinement.\n\nGrand Preceptor Wu once encountered Li Zuhanxu in an ancient temple in Xi’an. Seeing his pupils were perfectly square, he recognized him as an immortal, bowed in reverence, and sought the mysteries of the Dao. Ultimately, he too attained realization. This is another modern verification of square pupils.\n\nSu Shi’s poem *For Wang Yi, Departing for Fuzhou* reads:\n*\"Long ago I knew you in Wugong,\nShared wine and night talk in the cold quarters.\nWhen wine ran out and candles burned low, words still flowed,\nWhile weary servants dozed, stiff as folding screens.\nYou urged me to learn the deathless art,\nSaying you’d received it from a square-pupiled elder.\"*\n\nSong Lian of the Ming dynasty wrote: \"Traveling in Jiangnan, I met Zhou Yuanzhen (styled Yuanchu) on Phoenix Terrace. His square pupils gleamed, his long brows bristled, and he gazed with disdain upon all things below. I secretly thought he must be an immortal from Mount Gou, descending on a crane while playing the sheng.\"\n\nThe *History of Divine Immortals* records: \"Li Sheng, a native of Jiangxia, studied the arts of refining qi and nurturing form under a Daoist of Shaoshi. Yuan Zhen and Bai Juyi befriended him. In the gengzi year of Emperor Xizong’s reign, when Huang Chao invaded the capital, Li moved to Wanling.\"\n\nIn time, his complexion grew lustrous, his hair and beard turned blacker still, his pupils squared, and his teeth sharpened.\n\nIt is further said: \"Tao Hongjing lived in seclusion for forty years, practicing grain avoidance and guiding-and-pulling exercises. Though past eighty, he retained a youthful appearance, and one of his eyes would at times become square—truly the countenance of an immortal.\"\n\nAccording to Jia Song’s *Inner Biography of Tao the Recluse of Huayang*: \"In his later years, the master’s pupils suddenly turned perfectly square.\"\n\nZiyang’s *Biography of Zhou Ju* records: \"Once in the marketplace, the Master encountered Huang Tai, whose pupils were square. Recognizing him as an immortal, he sought the art of longevity, only to learn that he was Su Jun, the Minister of Xuanzhou.\"\n\nSome say: \"Square pupils grant a lifespan of ten thousand years.\" Ah! How extraordinary indeed.\n\n**72. Sleep Brings Supreme Comfort**\n\nWang Yangming’s poem reads:\n*On stone I sweep, burn incense, sleep at will,*\n*Awake to guests discoursing on the arcane.*\n*No palm-leaf fan stirs the pine wind—*\n*I sit before a hundred-zhang spring, sheer cliffs.*\n\nAnother of his poems:\n*An ancient cave, secluded, far from mortal tread,*\n*Stone bed, fine breeze—no dust is raised.*\n*Long the day, a sleep like Fuxi’s reign,*\n*Then the moon ascends the peak once more.*\n\nPei Du’s poem:\n*Well-fed, I stroll, then wake from sleep,*\n*A bowl of fresh tea awaits the boy’s brew.*\n*Cap doffed, I recline on the rattan couch—*\n*Wind-borne water sounds reach my ear.*\n\nThe Old Man of Banshan’s poem:\n*Fine script strains aging eyes; long mats invite deep rest.*\n*Take ease for this moment, cast the book aside—*\n*Regain the joy of youth.*\n\nLu You’s poem:\n*Facing each other on rush mats, the taste of sleep lingers long.*\n*Host and guest forget themselves in shared stillness.*\n*Soon the guest departs, the host drifts to sleep—*\n*Half the sunset fills the western window.*\n\nThe monk Yougui’s poem:\n*Reading weighs heavy on my brow;*\n*Only at my pillow do bones and joints relax.*\n*Sleeping, I lose all sense of time—*\n*Scant remains the daylight at the western pane.*\n\nLü Rongyang’s poem:\n*Old, I weary of reading documents, my interest wanes.*\n*Know this: worldly busyness cannot match idleness.*\n*On bamboo bed, ceramic pillow, in the empty hall,*\n*I lie gazing at Jiangnan’s mountains after rain.*\n\nCai Chizheng’s poem:\n*Paper screen, stone pillow, bamboo couch—*\n*Hands tired, I cast the book aside, midday dream lingers long.*\n*Waking, I smile to myself, alone—*\n*A few notes of a fisherman’s flute drift from the azure waves.*\n\nThe Old Man Xiaoxian’s poem:\n*Flowers and bamboo frame the quiet window, midday dream stretches long.*\n*Here, for a time, I forget the world.*\n*If I could meet the recluse of Mount Hua,*\n*I’d seek not the elixir of immortality, but the art of sleep.*\n\nYu Chan’s poem:\n*Nightly the primordial spirit lodges in the cinnabar field,*\n*Clouds fill the field, the moon fills the sky.*\n*Two mandarin ducks float on green waters—*\n*At the heart of the water, a golden-purple lotus.*\n\nAnother of his poems:\n*Deep in white clouds, I study Chen Tuan,*\n*One pillow of clear wind—heaven and earth expand.*\n*The moonlight seems to urge early rising,*\n*Yet the sound of the spring does not disturb the traveler’s rest.*\n*Just as the butterfly soars to the heavens,*\n*The cuckoo shatters the dream once more.*\n*Eyes open—half the window blazes with red sun—*\n*I suspect the Daoist has been firing his elixir all night.*\n\nLi Daochun’s *Manjianghong* lyric:\n*A fine tradition of sleep,*\n*With its own threefold samadhi of slumber.*\n*In sleep, the heart is sincere;*\n*In sleep, the intent is serene.*\n*Master the method of sleep, and you grasp its essence—*\n*Through sleep, you harmonize spirit and qi.*\n*This subtle art of sleep—*\n*Sleep as tranquil as dhyana—few understand.*\n\nI note that in the Jin dynasty, Tao Yuanming \"reclined high beneath the northern window, calling himself a man of Fuxi’s time.\" Truly, with body and mind both stilled, he used sleep to nurture spirit and rest. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"His sleep is unhurried, his waking at ease.\"\n\nConfucius also said: \"Eating coarse food, drinking water, pillowing my arm—happiness lies therein.\" This happiness arises when, in sleep, spirit and breath embrace, the spirit merges in darkness, the hundred vessels pulse in harmony, and bliss flows through the four limbs.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Yellow at the center, penetrating the pattern, rightly positioned in the body—beauty resides within.\"\n\nLong ago, the Yellow Emperor wandered in spirit to the land of Hua Xu. \"Clouds and mist did not obstruct his sight, thunder did not confuse his hearing, beauty and ugliness did not disturb his heart, mountains and valleys did not trip his steps.\" \"Awakening, he was joyful and content.\" This is proof of the Yellow Emperor’s benefit from reclining dhyana.\n\nOf the four dignified postures—walking, standing, sitting, lying—sleep is the most comfortable. When work wearies and energy flags, to stretch out on a couch, drift into sleep, and awaken refreshed—spirit at ease, qi flowing, the whole body at peace—is to reap the profound benefits of quiet nurturance in sleep.\n\nA human life spans a hundred years, active by day, resting by night, wholly dependent on sleep to regulate life and restore spirit. How much more so for those who practice the profound arts! For them, heart and breath intermingle in sleep, and even in sleep, heart and breath remain united.\n\nOrdinary people, in deep sleep at night, at the stillest moment, can only summon the true yin of heaven and earth, not the true yang. But if heart and breath unite in sleep, both can be summoned simultaneously. With the harmony of my heart and breath, I summon the harmony of heaven and earth—this is the moment when heaven and humanity unite. The benefits are boundless!\n\nWhen first practicing the union of heart and breath, if you can neither forget nor force it, but maintain it gently and continuously, even for a brief moment, you will fall asleep. Awakening, the hundred vessels are regulated, qi and blood harmonized, the spirit at ease—its wonder defies description.\n\nWith further progress, sleep naturally shifts into samadhi. Sleep is the harbinger of samadhi; samadhi arises from sleep. Beginners have sleep without samadhi; with long practice, they attain samadhi without sleep.\n\nThus, for beginners in cultivation, the ability to fall asleep is itself a sign of efficacy, and the ability to fall asleep naturally and swiftly is even more wondrous. This state of sleep-samadhi is called \"simulated samadhi,\" entirely distinct from the dull slumber of ordinary people. Chan practitioners fear sleep during meditation, while Daoist adepts in heart-breath union fear its absence—how marvelous! This sleep-samadhi is the common path for beginners, the precursor to the great samadhi of true emptiness.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, the venerable Chen Tuan of Mount Hua would often sleep for months without rising, and ultimately attained the Dao in sleep. His sleep method, known as the \"Hibernating Dragon Technique,\" consists of thirty-two characters and is none other than the practice of heart-breath union, cultivated specifically in sleep. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* describes ten kinds of sleep, among which are \"meditative sleep\" and \"samadhi sleep.\" The *Departure from the Worldly* chapter states:\n\n\"A bodhisattva-mahāsattva has ten kinds of sleep. What are the ten? They are:\n1. **Tranquil sleep**, for body and mind are serene;\n2. **Meditative sleep**, for one cultivates and regulates practice;\n3. **Samadhi sleep**, for body and mind are supple;\n4. **Brahmā sleep**, for one does not disturb self or others;\n5. **Virtuous karma sleep**, for one has no regrets afterward;\n6. **Right faith sleep**, for it cannot be shaken;\n7. **Right path sleep**, for good friends awaken one;\n8. **Vow-perfecting sleep**, for one skillfully dedicates merit;\n9. **All tasks completed sleep**, for all deeds are accomplished;\n10. **Abandoning all effort sleep**, for all habits are relinquished.\nThese are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the great Dharma-sleep of the Tathāgata, fully capable of awakening all beings.\"\n\nHere, \"meditative sleep\" refers to the state where body and mind remain unmoving, as if in samadhi. \"Samadhi sleep,\" however, is when the true yang of heaven and earth enters one’s body, like sweet dew filling the sky or ghee pouring upon the crown—throughout the body, one feels soft, blissful, harmonious as spring, and intoxicated with joy. The sūtra’s phrase \"body and mind are supple\" refers precisely to this state. Confucius’s \"leaning on his arm as a pillow, delighting in the midst of it\" is likewise the realm of \"samadhi sleep.\"\n\nThe *Accounts of Immortals and Forgotten Traditions* records: When Xiahou [gap in text] crossed mountains and rivers, he would often close his eyes in blissful sleep. Though his companions heard his snoring, his steps never faltered, earning him the name \"Sleeping Immortal.\" This was likely one who practiced sleep-samadhi alongside the venerable Chen Tuan. As Confucius said, \"Virtue is never solitary; it always has neighbors\"—was this not so?\n\nThe Confucian immortal Shao Yong, in his *Verses from the Forest Retreat*, wrote:\n*\"In old age, the body remains naturally warm and gentle,\nIn the Nest of Peace, spring is ever-present.\nWith all affairs dismissed from the heart, one reclines at ease,\nThe four limbs stretch and relax as they please.\"*\n\nElsewhere, he wrote:\n*\"At night, I enter the Nest of Peace,\nAt dawn, I drink the Great Harmony.\nProfoundly realizing the Dao, one abides in tranquility,\nIn pure cultivation, one receives the bounty of heaven.\"*\n\nThus, Master Shao deeply grasped sleep-samadhi.\n\nThe immortal Master Bai Yuchan wrote:\n*\"Since stepping through the gate of Nirvāṇa,\nA pillow of pure wind for ten thousand years.\"*\n\nThis was Master Bai’s accomplishment, attaining the wondrous state of \"all tasks completed sleep.\" The gate of Nirvāṇa’s stillness is precisely the \"supreme Dharma-sleep of the Tathāgata.\" At this stage, one enters the great rest, abandoning all effort.\n\nWhen Chan Master Linji was sleeping in the monks’ hall, Huangbo entered and struck the board with his staff. Linji lifted his head, saw it was Huangbo, and went back to sleep. Huangbo struck the board again, then went to the upper hall and saw the head monk sitting in meditation. He said, \"The junior below is sitting in meditation, yet you are indulging in idle thoughts here!\" The head monk replied, \"What is this old fellow doing?\" Huangbo struck the board once more and left the hall.\n\nWhen Xuefeng and Yantou were stranded by snow at Mount Ao in Fengzhou, Yantou spent his days sleeping, while Xuefeng sat in meditation. One day, Xuefeng called out, \"Elder brother, elder brother, get up!\" Yantou said, \"What for?\" Xuefeng replied, \"We’ve traveled together with that fellow Wensui, and everywhere we’ve gone, we’ve been burdened by him. Now that we’re here, why do you just keep sleeping?\" Yantou shouted, \"Go back to sleep! Sitting on your bed all day is like being in some backwater village—one day, you’ll end up bewitching the men and women of some household!\" Xuefeng patted his chest and said, \"I’m not at ease here; I dare not deceive myself.\" Yantou said, \"I thought one day you’d build a grass hut on a solitary peak and propagate the great teaching, yet here you are still speaking like this.\" Xuefeng replied, \"I truly am not at ease.\" Yantou said, \"If that’s so, then according to your understanding, speak it all out. Where it’s correct, I’ll affirm it for you; where it’s not, I’ll strike it down.\"\n\nXuefeng said, \"When I first arrived at Yanguang, I heard the abbot expound on the principle of form and emptiness and gained an entry point.\" Yantou said, \"For the next thirty years, be sure never to bring this up again.\" Later, he saw Dongshan’s *Verse on Crossing the Water*:\n*\"Beware of seeking it from others,\nFor it grows ever distant from me.\nIt is now precisely me,\nYet I am no longer it.\"*\n\nYantou said, \"If that’s the case, you haven’t even saved yourself yet.\" He continued, \"Later, I asked Deshan, ‘In the ancestral teachings from above, does a student like me have a share or not?’ Deshan struck me with his staff and said, ‘Say something!’ At the time, I was like a bucket whose bottom had fallen out.\" Yantou shouted, \"You didn’t even ask! Those who enter through the gate are not the family jewels.\"\n\nFeng said, \"How then is it truly so afterward?\"\nYantou replied, \"If afterward you propagate the great teaching, let every word flow from your own breast, then come and cover heaven and earth with me.\"\nAt these words, Feng attained great awakening. He bowed and rose, exclaiming repeatedly, \"Brother, only today has Aoshan realized the Dao!\"\nAlas, if Linji and Yantou could be said to have accomplished all that was to be done, they would have attained the Tathāgata’s \"reclining in nirvana.\"\n\nWang Yangming’s poem reads:\n*\"In the human world, broad daylight—awake yet still asleep;\nThe old master in the mountains sleeps yet is truly awake.\nSleep and wakefulness: neither two nor one, yet both are so—\nMisty clouds over the stream, cool and clear the flowing water.\"*\n\n**Appendix: Chen Tuan’s Poem on Sleep, Presented to Jin Lijun**\nThe common man measures nothing,\nOnly sleep is held in weight.\nThe whole world seeks rest,\nYet the soul departs while the spirit remains unmoved.\nUpon waking, knowing nothing,\nCraving’s heart grows ever more intense.\nHow laughable are those in the dust,\nWho know not that dreams are dreams.\n\nThe perfected man is dreamless,\nYet his dreams are journeys among immortals.\nThe true man is sleepless,\nFor sleep is but floating clouds and mist.\nNear the furnace, the elixir nears completion;\nWithin the gourd, another heaven unfolds.\nTo know the realm of sleep and dreams—\nThe foremost mystery of the human world.\n\n**Chen Xiyi’s Ancestral Sleep Method, also called the Hibernating Dragon Technique**\nThe dragon returns to the primordial sea,\nYang concealed within yin.\nMen call it the hibernating dragon;\nI call it the hibernating heart.\nSilently concealing its function,\nBreath sinks deep, deep.\nReclining high amidst white clouds,\nThe world has no knowing kin.\n\n**Lü Dongbin’s Inscription**\nReclining high on Zhongnan, ten thousand cares dissolved,\nThe Sleeping Immortal lies long amidst white clouds.\nThe dreaming soul steals into the gates of yin and yang,\nBreath and pulse subtly enact the work of creation.\nWho knows the true method hidden in chaos?\nThe Daoist must first learn to be deaf and dumb.\nThe hermit of Huashan left this sleeping art—\nNow I reveal it to awaken the public.\n\n**Zhang Sanfeng’s *Hibernating Dragon Chant***\nSleep, immortal sleep,\nOn stone roots reclining, years forgotten.\nThe three luminaries sink, the nature rounds.\nQi upon qi returns to the mysterious aperture,\nBreath upon breath follows nature’s course.\nDo not scatter, must be tranquil,\nWarmly nurturing mercury’s nature to roundness,\nWaiting for lead’s blossom to appear.\nNo loss, with vigilance,\nTrue fire’s timing moves between.\nSeven returns—no difficulty;\nNine refinements—what lament?\nSilently watch the dragon and tiger battle,\nSecretly invert yin and yang.\nMen call me a drowsy fool,\nYet I sleep—sleep yet not sleep.\nMastering true reclining meditation,\nCultivating true primordial embryo,\nThe hibernating dragon rises and ascends to heaven.\nThis hibernation method—who transmitted it?\nCurving the arm for a pillow, from Ni Mountain’s self,\nJoy lies within, unknown to others.\nFive dragons leap from the deep abyss.\nHeaven bestowed this method upon Tu Nan;\nWho in Tu Nan’s lineage could continue it?\nThe slovenly Daoist, Zhang Fengxian.\n\n**Zhang Sanfeng’s *Fisherman’s Song***\nThe hibernation method—soundless yet sounding,\nSound upon sound speaks to the inner heart.\nSpirit silent, qi obscure,\nThe hibernating dragon sleeps yet sleeps awake.\n\n**Zhang Sanfeng’s Postscript to the Hibernating Dragon Method**\nSome say Master Xiyi transmitted another sleep method to the world, and that what circulates now is all spurious.\n\nThe *Xici* commentary on the hexagram *Sui* states: *\"The noble person, toward dusk, enters into rest and repose.\"* It does not say *\"rests and reposes at dusk\"* but *\"enters into rest and repose\"*—the subtlety lies precisely in the word *\"enters.\"* To enter is the sleep method. With spirit entering the qi cavity, sitting or lying both contain the sleep practice—why must one recline on a stone pillow?\n\nThese thirty-two characters may well bring one to sudden great awakening. Lü Dongbin brought them to light out of compassion, which is also the heart of correcting errors.\n\n**Zhang Quanyi’s Postscript, written while residing on Mount Zhongnan**\n\n**Appendix: Letter from Master Wang to Meng Yangwu of Tianjin**\nI now transcribe and present Chen Xiyi’s sleep method, transmitted by the two ancestral masters Lü and Zhang. You may ponder it carefully. In sum, it does not exceed the four characters: *\"heart and breath mutually dependent.\"*\n\nThe elixir path has four methods—walking, standing, sitting, and lying—but the sleep method is the simplest and easiest. How do we know it is simple and easy? The greatest fear in learning the Dao is attachment to the physical body. If one clings to the physical body, it is merely a turbid thing of the posterior heaven, not the true yin and true yang of the prior heaven.\n\nWhen sleeping, body and mind must both be still. The method says: *\"The body unmoving, the heart naturally at peace; the heart unmoving, the spirit naturally guarded.\"* In a brief moment, practice *\"heart and breath mutually dependent.\"* Upon falling asleep, one naturally enters the state of no-self, no-other, forgetting things and form. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Wandering in the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\"*\n\nYou must understand that as long as heart and breath are mutually dependent when falling asleep, upon deep sleep, heart and breath will naturally remain so. Do not deliberately arrange it—what was called in the previous letter *\"following nature, not passively accepting it.\"* If you deliberately arrange it, you depart from the principle of *\"following nature.\"*\n\nAt any time, if there is leisure, proceed with the practice. If the physical body shows the slightest arousal of yang, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. If the physical body feels the slightest softness, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. If the physical body shows the slightest movement of qi or numbness, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. You must know the physical body is a thief—those who learn the Dao must never mistake the thief for their child.\n\nYou must practice until breath ceases, utterly tranquil and settled, not under your own control. As Master Ziyang said: *\"Though it acts as host, I am but a guest.\"* If you can abide in this for two hours, you are not far from the state of youthful purity.\n\nWhen practicing the sleep technique, ensure to eat lightly and frequently.\n\nWang Hu, seventh day of the third month in the fifth year, aged seventy-three.\n\nThe profound mystery of intoxication: For Daoist cultivators of the Mysterious School, when practice reaches the state of *huanghu yaoming* (vague obscurity), external breath becomes faint—seeming both present and absent—at this moment, primordial true yang penetrates within, steaming the four limbs, irrigating above and below, suffusing with warm harmony, subtle and serene, resembling a gentle intoxication. As *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *\"Primordial qi, postnatal breath—those who attain it are ever as if drunk.\"* The preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *\"At first like clouds filling a thousand mountains, then like the moon embracing ten thousand waters; the spine like a turning wheel, the four limbs like mountain stone; the pores like one just risen from a bath, the bones and channels like one deep in slumber; the spirit like lovers in joyful union, the hun and po like mother and child in tender embrace.\"* These are the signs of primordial harmony between yin and yang, the true mechanism of gathering and refinement. To often enter this intoxicated realm, this state of *xiyi* (profound tranquility), is to constantly summon celestial harmony, where spirit and qi intermingle—thus the effects of nurturing the immortal embryo and refining the foundation become manifest. This \"intoxication\" is the hallmark of the Mysterious School. Ancient immortals who sang of it are too numerous to count, such as Jingyang’s *Drunken Longing for Immortality*, Sanfeng’s *Song of Primordial Qi*, and Ziyang’s *Song of Stone Bridge*.\n\nIn Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious*, the word \"intoxication\" appears frequently, as in:\n*\"Draw forth the cinnabar from Kan’s center, a golden flower reveals its branch.\nAuspicious clouds unfold across the heavens, propitious light fills the realm of death.\nReturning, one is dim and silent, like one drunk, like one entranced.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Wait for that single point to submit of its own accord, within the body it transforms into the four seasons’ spring.\nA wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance—each rain’s passing brings renewal.\nAll day languid as a drunkard, idly guarding the cavern’s eternal spring.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk, ah drunk, again drunk—within the cinnabar field, spring suffuses red as jade.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Riding the dragon, sword in hand, drunk I return home, revolving the three passes to pay homage at the northern gate.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Hungry, I drink the wine of immortality, each day merrily drunk as mud.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you ask where the return path lies, in drunkenness I point afar to the edge of white clouds.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Gathering the nectar from the eastern position, it becomes sweet dew; drinking the wine of the western realm, one is drunk amid brocade.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The Yellow Dame urges me to drink the wine of supreme bliss, each day steaming drunk in revelry.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wine of mysterious clarity—drunk as one entranced, all yin exhausted, the radiant yang season arrives.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"In movement and stillness, adding mercury and drawing forth lead, like one entranced, like one drunk, the spirit never wearies.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The intent from the west—like one drunk, like one entranced.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wine of longevity needs no cup, sweet as honey, naturally sipping the medicinal measure, merrily off to the Peach Assembly.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"With a single sweep of light, behold the sovereign—before flowers and beneath the moon, merrily drunk.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I pass beyond the village at slanting sunlight—who knows I am the drunken dancer?\"*\nAnd:\n*\"In the western lands and southern realms, friends come to pay respects, as in days past, drunk and dazed.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk and dazed, forgetting heaven and earth—all fame and profit of past and present are but dust.\"*\n\nTruly, he had deeply grasped the threefold taste of the Mysterious School’s drunken immortality!\n\nAncestor Jingyang said:\n*\"Drunk longing for immortality, drunk longing for immortality—idle, I visit the grotto heavens.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Suddenly warming, I drift drunk to the immortal isles; the grotto gate slightly ajar, a young attendant watches.\"*\n\nAncestor Lü said:\n*\"Cultivate, cultivate until you reach the firm and dry—only then are you a drunken immortal in the human realm.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The jade zither and precious lute play for you; jade nectar and fine wine urge you to drink.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Unaware, I become drunk as if in a trance—within the trance, something appears.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I say when drunk, truly drunk; I know not how sorrow arises.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Once the true scripture is attained, like one drunk—breath and a hundred pulses all return to the root.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When the medicine is obtained, do not be reckless—like one entranced, like one drunk, speak less.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk on green wine, sleeping through sun and moon; when the white duckweed wind stills, I fish by rivers and lakes.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"All day with no one to speak of tidings, a pot of spring wine to drink merrily.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Bored, I sleep drunk at the mountain path’s mouth; idle, I wander and fish in Dongting’s heart.\"*\n\nMaster Haichan said:\n*\"Drunk, I wander the land of white clouds, the copper-tailed handle upturned.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Liu the Fool arrives at the Dragon Flower Assembly, drunk by the limpid pool, the moon lingering late.\"*\n\nTan Chuduan said:\n*\"Since the clouds gathered within the tripod, I have constantly drunk the wine of supreme bliss, lying drunk in that realm.\"*\n\nTang Guangzhen said:\n*\"Only when the elixir is formed through union—drunk within the gourd, no need for support.\"*\n\nMa Danyang said:\n*\"All day I raise the cup to delight in the spirit’s grace; drunk, yet someone supports me.\"*\n\nZhang Ziyang’s *Song of Stone Bridge* says:\n*\"The scene is most beautiful, I rejoice in secret, pouring my own wine, merrily drunk.\nI pluck a stringless zither, its notes teaching me to listen carefully.\nAlas, after drunkenness, none know—dim and silent, just like one entranced.\"*\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*\"Drunk, I sleep soundly in deep slumber—my boat laden with treasures crosses Cao Creek.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said:\n*\"To make Zhang Gong drunk, you must use Li Gong’s wine.\nWait until his winter solstice arrives—a single cup of supreme bliss then enters his mouth.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Those who came together to lean on the railing—drunk in the spring wind, awaiting the moon’s return.\"*\n\nLi Xu’an said:\n*\"First gather primordial yang as millet grains,\nThen brew true qi to ferment yellow millet—\nWithin this, the elixir of long life ferments,\nOne day’s turning brings a single bout of drunkenness.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan said:\n*\"A carefree immortal, soul fallen in blissful drunkenness,\nLaughing, he leans on his staff by the setting sun.\"*\n\nLi Qing’an said:\n*\"At leisure we drink together in the Vermilion Mound Palace,\nDrunk, we sleep side by side in the Purple Ultimate Temple.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous intoxication of the Mysterious School.\n\nHuanliu Wen Chan Master said:\n*\"Since entering Zhongnan to plant the field of arts,\nMistakenly called a cave-dwelling immortal.\nThe jar’s spring yields the wine of long life,\nAll day tipsy, I pillow my head upon stone and sleep.\"*\n\nFalin Yin Chan Master said:\n*\"Drunk, I know not how narrow heaven and earth are—\nTransplanting the plum beyond the window as the moon arrives.\"*\n\nJian’an Yi Chan Master said:\n*\"Accustomed to borrowing from the strings and pipes,\nLeisurely I intoxicate myself in a world of falling blossoms.\"*\n\nTiefan Zhou Chan Master said:\n*\"In Eastern Yue we met, drunk and sleeping several times,\nThe bright moon over the tower mirrored by Lake Jing’s edge.\"*\n\nDaoquan Gao Chan Master said:\n*\"Amid myriad flowers, I buy village wine,\nBy the Nine-Bend River, I moor my fishing boat.\nDrunk, I toss the silk reel with a casual hand,\nA straw cloak slung askew in the evening sun.\"*\n\nZhizhi Nan Chan Master said:\n*\"I laugh at the flower-and-wine guests of Chang’an—\nA drunken man must be helped home by another drunken man.\"*\n\nTianzhang Yu Chan Master said:\n*\"Drunk, I lean against the golden chamber where pearl curtains hang quiet,\nThe lingering fragrance of flowers, once revealed, remains deep.\"*\n\nShangfang Yi Chan Master said:\n*\"The spring light of Golden Valley ever fills the eye,\nThe red peony’s branches fragrant and lush.\nLast night a gust of western wind brought a chill,\nScattered blossoms cover the ground—how boundless their fall.\nThe noble scion, drunk, knows not the way home,\nStill by the railing he demands a golden cup.\"*\n\nFachang Yu Chan Master said:\n*\"How to distinguish hemp’s skin?\nSnow in the twelfth month, boiled for tea, sobers your drunkenness.\nThere are paths men have not trod—\nWildflowers smile on the old branches of spring.\"*\n\nWuwen Can Chan Master said:\n*\"Beneath the thatch, singing and sleeping, drunk then waking,\nJun Mountain lies only between my brows.\nMy whole household cares not for matters of rise and fall,\nEver harmonizing with the clouds to claim Dongting.\"*\n\nZhe’an Fan Chan Master said:\n*\"For years I’ve lain entangled in deep clouds,\nGolden pipes and silver flutes heard in my drunkenness.\nReturning to the mountain path in autumn’s hues,\nBy the white apple’s shore and islets, I meet you again.\"*\n\nQianrengang Chan Master said:\n*\"Amid the fragrance of peonies, the wind sways gracefully,\nIn the shadow of pear blossoms, the moon is round.\nThe host, drunk, sleeps on Fuxi’s pillow,\nGazing upside-down at the pearl curtain’s reflection.\"*\n\nTianyu Bao Chan Master said:\n*\"Rain ceases, clouds disperse, the clearing sky is serene,\nA young lord, spring-drunk in the spring pavilion.\nThis boundless charm—with whom can it be shared?\nA bird’s cry, and autumn fills heaven and earth.\"*\n\nXiaoyue Lang Chan Master said:\n*\"Plunging body and soul into the Azure Dragon’s cave,\nI pull out coral trees by the handful.\nStripped of their common brushwood worth,\nI trade them for wine to get drunk in the flowery streets.\"*\n\nZhengtang Ban Chan Master said:\n*\"I ask the world—what is there to rush about?\nBetter to report spring’s affairs to spring’s light.\nEven if drunk before flowers every day,\nIn one season, that’s ninety rounds in all.\"*\n\nQie’an Ren Chan Master said:\n*\"Meeting, we drink and sing together,\nDrunk on the road, you demand I carry you.\nCarried home, you still curse—\nWho knows what you’ll be like when you wake?\"*\n\nTianduo En Chan Master said:\n*\"The spring colors of the Five Mounds are rich and full,\nThe eastern wind at my back blows without end.\nDrunk, I call the riverside guest who will not return—\nThe cuckoo’s cry fades on the green willow’s branch.\"*\n\nLan’an Shu Chan Master said:\n*\"The bamboo jar’s brew should be ripe by now,\nI spare not my hat, askew in my drunkenness.\nThe wild rose’s fragrance lingers faintly—\nIt was the wine all along, not the flowers.\"*\n\nFoxing Tai Chan Master said:\n*\"Our meeting in the garden was not in vain,\nClearly I entrusted it to you.\nYou’re drunk, I help you up;\nI fall, you help me in turn.\nAlternating as host and guest,\nTogether we enter the imperial capital.\"*\n\nLü’an Yue Chan Master said:\n*\"Zhang Gong wished to urge Li Gong to drink,\nBut was instead penalized a cup by Li Gong.\nSeated together, they played the swift-mouthed game,\nDrunk, they returned as the moon rose over the cold plum.\"*\n\nBiefeng Yin Chan Master said:\n*\"A thousand feet of silk line hangs straight down,\nWhen the brocade-scaled fish leaps onto the hook.\nIn slanting wind and fine rain, I sing as I go home—\nDrunk by the thatched window, utterly oblivious.\"*\n\nYinshan Xian Chan Master said:\n*\"On Mount Ao, resplendent, we roam in joy,\nAll night the wind and light reflect the emerald stream.\nAs the moon sets and dawn breaks at the sky’s edge,\nDrunk, I help the young lord ascend the high tower.\"*\n\nZhenjing Wen Chan Master said:\n*\"Cutting straight to the root, spring beyond the teachings,\nWho is not a sage, who does not commune with spirits?\nThough I say I’ve left the viper’s den,\nI’ve become a man of no-mind, ever drunk.\"*\n\nSu’an Ding Chan Master said:\n*\"In summer, red lotuses sway on the green pond,\nFish dart up and down, busy as can be.\nRosy clouds rise on both banks, the warm wind intoxicates,\nWashing body and mind in the fragrant water realm.\"*\n\nDuanqiao Lun Chan Master said:\n*\"The old man in the green straw cloak, utterly drunk in his short boat,\nAs the moon sets over the riverside village, his sleep is deep.\nWaking at dawn, his eyes are clear—\nA single thread of wind stirs the heart of the waves.\"*\n\nHengxiu She Chan Master said:\n*\"What is the point of sitting upright in solemn robes?\nThe mountains and rivers are one, the age is at peace.\nBeyond the curtain, the spring wind rises at night—\nDrunk, I sleep on the dragon bed, utterly unaware.\"*\n\nMeng’an Lü Chan Master said:\n*\"Rising early to cherish the flowers, sitting in the spring wind,\nMy young lord is already playing with green and red.\nHand in hand, we get drunk beneath the blossoms,\nUnknowing of the layered shadows of clouds and moon.\"*\n\nTian’an Sheng Chan Master said:\n*\"After Zhang the Mad, no one is madder,\nThe Drunken Sage of calligraphy passed down.\nHeedless of broken halberds and short spears,\nTo this day, clouds and mist rise from the paper.\"*\n\nBoji Jian Chan Master said:\n*\"A bright moon wheel over the southern land,\nHand in hand, we ascend the wine tower.\"*\n\n\"As long as the host can make me drunk,\nWhy should I stir up homesickness again?\"\n\nSu’an Ding Chan Master said:\n*\"Cold mist and setting sun fill the forest’s edge,\nWine cups pass frequently, spirits soar high.\nIf the fine guest can still be blown to drunkenness,\nThe host, once sober, brews pure wine anew.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous drunkenness of the Chan school.\n\nSong Confucian Shao Yaofu’s *Jirao Collection* states:\n*\"In the Peaceful Joy Nest, a single cup of wine—\nNot only nurtures qi but also preserves the true.\nSipped again and again until mildly drunk,\nWith every pat, the heart brims with spring.\nNo different from the first meeting of lord and minister,\nOr heaven and earth’s sudden intertwining of yin and yang.\nThe intoxicating savor defies description,\nThe alchemy’s workings elude all pointing.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"A thousand sages’ mysteries lie in chaos,\nDrunk, one embraces spring’s myriad blossoms.\"*\n\nMing Confucian Chen Baisha wrote:\n*\"Alone, I hasten to the stream’s edge, dancing in my fishing cloak,\nMoon bright, drunk shadows sway together.\nIn hand, I grasp the Tong River’s line—\nTo pierce the river-sky, no need for many casts.\"*\n\nHe also wrote:\n*\"West Woods gathers rain, the turtledove’s spirit lingers,\nI roll up the quilt, open the window to dawn’s clarity.\nWind and sun intoxicate the flowers, flowers intoxicate the birds,\nPast the bamboo gate, two or three calls echo.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A thousand peaks fall silent, keeping you drunk,\nBegging the world to turn into a painted boat.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous drunkenness of the Confucian school.\n\nGenerally, drunkenness has pre-heaven and post-heaven distinctions. Post-heaven drunkenness arises from excessive drinking, where the spirit and essence are overwhelmed by intoxication. Pre-heaven drunkenness, however, is the harmonious union of the body’s yin and yang, externally infused with the primordial qi of original harmony, steaming and melting, the spirit in perfect equilibrium—entering a state of vagueness and profound obscurity akin to drunkenness. My late master, instructing his inner disciples, often cited this phrase as the path of cultivation. For one who can constantly abide in this \"drunk-like\" state dwells purely in the pre-heavenly, avoids the illnesses of the physical body, and all dharmic proofs arise unbidden. This phrase, \"constantly as if drunk,\" is the esoteric essence of the Daoist school’s drunken immortality samadhi, and serves as verification of the *Great Change*’s \"yellow center penetrates principle\" and \"preserving the great harmony\"—what is called \"beauty within, flowing through the four limbs,\" precisely the scenery of drunkenness.\n\nMing Confucian Chen Baisha said: *\"Sobering is easier than getting drunk; only those deeply versed in the *Yi* can achieve true drunkenness.\"* Herein lies the secret profundity of sagely learning!\n\n**Appendix:**\nCangmingzi’s poem on the *Ruyao Jing*’s \"Those who attain it are constantly as if drunk,\" with commentary.\n\nThe poem reads:\n*The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is supremely subtle,\nScholars abound, but who truly comprehends?\nOnce attained, know it as eternal attainment—\nBest to lay the foundation with swift action.\nIn the dim and silent vastness of the void,\nThere is being, there is non-being—mystery without end.\nWithin the square-inch pot, it never runs dry,\nFor the self knows no day without spring’s wind.*\n\nThe commentary states: This describes the scenery after obtaining the medicine. Once the golden liquid returning elixir is swallowed and enters the belly, it transforms the mortal frame into a true person, giving rise to natural phenomena. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Trickling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice, from head to foot it streams, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through boundless depths, it fills the body with gentle warmth. The complexion becomes increasingly moist, the bones and joints grow ever stronger.\"* All this is \"beauty within, shining on the face, flourishing on the back, flowing through the four limbs, reaching the entire body\"—self-evident, these are all natural effects.\n\n**Appendix:**\nExcerpt from Master Wang’s letter to Mr. Meng of Tianjin:\n\nThe terms \"gathering\" and \"harvesting\" cannot be separated. If gathering and harvesting cannot be distinguished, how can the pre-heavenly essence, qi, and spirit be separated? If one says: *\"In the state of profound obscurity, one gathers pre-heavenly essence; in the state of vagueness, one gathers pre-heavenly primordial qi; in the state of primal chaos, one gathers pre-heavenly primordial spirit\"*—this is merely speaking of principle. To know that profound obscurity, vagueness, and primal chaos cannot be separated is to know that primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit also cannot be separated.\n\nSome say: *\"Gather in profound obscurity, welcome in vagueness.\"* Others say: *\"Use it unseen, meet in vagueness.\"* And again: *\"Gather in vagueness, harvest in obscurity, within profound obscurity collect the true thing.\"* In sum, these are the true writings of various masters, each taking their own imagery. Only the *Ruyao Jing* states it most directly and wondrously: *\"Pre-heavenly qi, post-heavenly qi—those who attain it are constantly as if drunk.\"* The three words \"constantly as if drunk\" are truly crucial.\n\nPushing further: the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, every stage’s scenery, every stage’s effects, every stage’s firing times—all are \"constantly as if drunk.\" If even a thread or hair clings to the physical body, it is no longer \"constantly as if drunk.\" If it is not \"constantly as if drunk,\" it is not the Way. To know \"constantly as if drunk\" is to know how a foolish, ignorant person ascends to the realm of the sages.\n\nFurthermore, I have four or five commentaries on the *Yu Huang Xin Yin Jing*, but Lu Qianxu’s *Xin Yin Ce Shu* is the finest. I have specially mailed you a copy—be sure to read and contemplate it deeply, and perhaps you will grasp the wonder of \"constantly as if drunk.\"\n\n**74. Stability is Most Supreme**\nIn the work of the Daoist school, one first enters vagueness and profound obscurity through sleep, then from vagueness and profound obscurity attains great stability. External breathing ceases—initially like a lone leaf of a skiff drifting in midstream, and with time, like the moon illuminating a cold pond, ten thousand miles of limpid blue. The duration gradually lengthens from short to long.\n\nThe transformation of the spiritual embryo and the transmutation of the divine all unfold within the state of stability—this is the mysterious gateway to entering sageliness and the essential ford to transcending the mundane. Dongshan said: *\"Right within the off-center, at the first watch of the third night, the moon shines bright.\"* Tong’an said: *\"How does one sing the tune of returning home? Before the moonlit hall, blossoms on a withered tree.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"A single wheel of moonlight keeps me company.\"* And again: *\"A single wheel of bright moon illuminates the flourishing south.\"* Liu Wuyuan said: *\"A single wheel of bright moon shines at the heart of heaven.\"* Shao Yaofu said: *\"The moon of the parasol tree shines into my bosom.\"* And again: *\"The moon reaches the heart of heaven, the wind comes to the surface of the water.\"* All these describe the realm of stability. Whether in Chan, Daoism, or Confucianism, none fails to take stability as its归宿.\n\nZhuangzi speaks of *\"auspiciousness rests where it rests\"* and *\"abiding in great stability.\"* He also says: *\"The spirit that arises from instability is not borne by the Dao.\"* Profound and subtle indeed!\n\nStability has two distinct types: the first is stability with breathing, and the second is stability without breathing. The practice of the Daoist school pertains to the second kind—where body and mind are both stabilized, the breath of inhalation and exhalation ceases, and the eyelids remain unmoving. This is true quiescence. If the mind is stable but the breath does not cease, it is but a semblance of quiescence, not true stability.\n\nIn the *Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra*, *The Assembly of the Vastly Learned Sage*, the World-Honored One told the sage: *\"Great Sage, you should know that among my disciples, the foremost voice-hearer, Gavāṃpati, is a Brahmin of pure lineage. Abiding in the meditative stability of compassion, he opens the eye of kindness with such mastery that he enters samādhi. Only once every seven days does he manifest a single breath of inhalation and exhalation. When he enters samādhi, a wind responsive to his will arrives at his bidding. Even if the kalpa-fire were to burn heaven and earth into a single blaze, his meditative body would remain unharmed—not so much as a mustard seed’s worth—while his limbs, like Mount Meru, stand immovably firm. The dragon kings Nanda and Upananda, possessed of great power, stir the winds with fierce might, causing Mount Meru to tremble, roaring like thunder, and turning the waters of the four great seas salty. Yet when Gavāṃpati enters samādhi, those two dragon kings, exerting all their might, cannot disturb him in the slightest.\"*\n\nSince it is said that only once every seven days does he manifest a breath of inhalation and exhalation, it is clear that when he truly enters samādhi, he is free from breathing and can remain in stability for seven days. Even the mighty dragon kings cannot move him by a hair’s breadth, and even the raging kalpa-fire cannot harm a single strand of his being. Thus, the great quiescent stability without breath is most sublime, beyond the reach of thought or discussion.\n\nMoreover, in the *Sūtra of the Essential Collections of All Buddhas*, it is recorded that Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, having departed from the world of Endurance (this world), arrived at the realm of the Buddha Heavenly King of Universal Light. To the right of the Thus-Come One Heavenly King stood a woman named Detached Mind, seated in full lotus, abiding in the samādhi of the Moon of Universal Purity, Free from Defilement. Mañjuśrī asked the Heavenly King Buddha: *\"How long has this woman aspired to the supreme, correct, and true path of enlightenment? Her conduct is serene, her vows lofty, and her stability so profound—what is the duration of her resolve?\"* The Buddha replied: *\"Since she first aroused the aspiration for the supreme, correct, and true path, it cannot be reckoned. Diligent and faithful, she is ever free from negligence, practicing generosity, precepts, patience, vigor, single-minded concentration, and wisdom, perfecting the Buddha Way. Her deeds are complete. Mañjuśrī, bid this woman arise from samādhi, and you may ask her how long she has upheld the path. You will see her response.\"*\n\nThereupon, Mañjuśrī, hearing the Buddha’s instruction, rose from his seat and approached the woman. With utmost sincerity, he snapped his fingers and called out in a great voice, seeking to rouse her. Yet she remained still, unmoving in samādhi. Mañjuśrī then transformed his form into countless manifestations, snapping his fingers ever higher, so that the sound of his snapping reached innumerable worlds in the ten directions—yet the woman remained unmoved, not arising from samādhi.\n\nThen Mañjuśrī entered the samādhi of the Form-Likeness Concentration and manifested great spiritual powers. All beings in the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds—humans, devas, dragons, gandharvas, and others—countless in number, found their instruments of music sounding of their own accord, while he conjured lutes, zithers, harps, flutes, and myriad other instruments, all playing in unison, producing soft, clear, harmonious, and elegant sounds, mournful and sorrowful, each emitting countless tones that resounded through the ten directions and immeasurable worlds—yet they could not rouse the woman from samādhi.\n\nMañjuśrī again entered the samādhi of the Form-Likeness Concentration and transformed the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds: Mount Sumeru, the Snow Mountains, the Black Mountains, Mount Mucilinda, the Great Mount Mucilinda, the Iron Enclosure Mountains, and the Great Iron Enclosure Mountains—all collided and clashed, unable to remain still. Like a mighty warrior clapping his palms with great force, or like a great thunderclap, the sound spread far and wide, heard by all. As the mountains—Sumeru, the Iron Enclosures, and others—collided and trembled, each crumbled and fell, their forms terrifying, their sounds piteous. Yet the great noise reached immeasurable, boundless worlds, and still, the woman’s samādhi did not waver.\n\nThen Mañjuśrī, without approaching her, employed his skillful means: with both hands, he seized the woman, seeking to raise her into a seated posture. Yet he shook the buddha-lands of the Ganges’ sands below, and still, he could not move her so much as a hair’s breadth, nor could he cause her to arise from samādhi.\n\nMoreover, Mañjuśrī summoned all his power, seeking to lift the woman. Yet even as he uprooted and overturned buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, he could not rouse her from samādhi. Mañjuśrī then severed the ground beneath where she sat, lifting her upon his right palm and casting her beyond buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges to the east. To the south, west, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below—each direction received buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the same manner. Across the buddha-lands of the ten directions, all musical instruments and melodies resounded, mountains crumbled and fell with terrifying sounds, heavenly flowers rained down, and their harmonious echoes spread unimaginably—yet still, he could not rouse the woman from samādhi.\n\nThereupon, Mañjuśrī tossed the woman throughout the ten directions, yet failed to awaken her, and so returned her to her original place. With hands clasped, he addressed Tathāgata Heavenly King: “O Great Sage, the practices of all bodhisattvas are most extraordinary, beyond reach or measure. In contemplation, I weigh thus: I can transform the vessels of empty space, make them stand, revolve, walk, come, converse—yet now, I manifest boundless divine concentration, transformative movements, and stirring great sounds; I shatter Sumeru and the Iron Enclosure Mountains, uproot buddha-lands, and shift the worlds of the ten directions—yet still, I cannot cause her to arise from samādhi. I shall humble myself and bow to this woman. Moreover, all other learned bodhisattvas, all sons and daughters of noble families who first arouse the unsurpassed, true, and correct aspiration for the Way—whether already accomplished, yet to be accomplished, or just beginning their studies—if they aspire to such boundless great wisdom, they too should pay homage to her. Why is this so? The practices of bodhisattvas cannot be repaid or compared.”\n\nTathāgata Heavenly King replied to Mañjuśrī: “Truly, as you say, the armor of virtue worn by bodhisattvas and great beings is inconceivable. All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot comprehend it—how much less can ordinary beings attain it! It is like taking a great drumstick the size of a thousand-world universe and striking a drum before this woman for a full kalpa, or even beyond a kalpa—yet she would not hear its sound, much less arise from samādhi. Mañjuśrī, should this woman’s samādhi remain still and tranquil, never wavering, her wisdom of the Way would be thus, her virtue and power without limit.”\n\nNow, when the woman Li Yi entered this samādhi of true concentration, she must have severed both inhalation and exhalation; otherwise, had the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī merely used his spiritual power to cut off her breath, this woman would not have remained in samādhi. Yet even as Mañjuśrī shook, overturned, and hurled her across the ten directions, she was not disturbed; even when he carried her to the realm of Brahmā, she remained unaware. His divine power could not so much as ruffle a single hair of hers—her stillness and concentration remained unchanged. Could one who has not stilled both thought and breath, returning to the state of nothingness, achieve such a state?\n\nFurthermore, if breath ceases but the pulse does not, Mañjuśrī could have used his spiritual power to restrain her moving pulse, and the woman would not have been able to re-enter samādhi. Only when breath ceases, pulse ceases, and body and mind are extinguished like empty space can one remain unmoved by external forces. The great stillness of the profound school precisely embodies this image.\n\nI observe that the concentration of the woman Li Yi is truly perfect, like a living corpse—thus, even Mañjuśrī could not disturb her. Her ability to draw near to Tathāgata Heavenly King is precisely because her body and mind are as still and clear as empty space. This koan contains two layers of meaning.\n\nIn its simpler interpretation, when body and mind are extinguished and one enters deep samādhi, it is like empty space—no external force can disturb it, no thought or movement of the mind can arise to break the concentration. This demonstrates the excellence of meditative concentration.\n\nIn its deeper, esoteric interpretation, Mañjuśrī represents wisdom, while Li Yi represents concentration. Concentration and wisdom are one—thus, wisdom cannot rouse her from concentration, for Mañjuśrī’s spiritual power is not inferior to hers. The great fool Zhi once said, “A monk lodging in a temple”—this phrase is most profound, for it reveals the wondrous unity of concentration and wisdom.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Entry into the Realm of Reality” chapter, the youth Sudhana visits the bhikṣu Ocean Banner. He sees him seated in the full lotus posture, entering samādhi, with inhalation and exhalation ceased, no separate thoughts or awareness, both thought and breath forgotten—this is the same realm as entering true concentration in the profound school. Ocean Banner remained in samādhi for six months and six days, during which, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, countless buddha-bodies, bodhisattva-bodies, pratyekabuddha and śrāvaka-bodies, Indra-bodies, Brahmā-bodies, elder and householder-bodies, kṣatriya and brāhmaṇa-bodies, sage-bodies, dragon-king bodies, asura-king bodies, yakṣa and rākṣasa-bodies, kiṁnara-king bodies, and gandharva-king bodies manifested, pervading the ten directions and the entire dharma-realm. The excellence and uniqueness of this realm left Sudhana in ceaseless admiration. This profound samādhi is called *Universal Eye Attainment*, also known as the *Gate of Universal Adornment and Purity*, and is most vast.\n\nThe meditative concentration of the profound school, beginning with a few minutes and extending to several hours or even a full day and night, can, with further advancement, last for six months in a single sitting—thus, it is not difficult to follow in the footsteps of Ocean Banner and rival the sages of old. The *Ten Concentrations* chapter of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* records that the Tathāgata, in the Hall of Universal Light, entered the *Samādhi of All Buddhas in a Single Instant*, abiding in *śamatha*, most tranquil, possessing great virtue and power, unstained by anything, enabling all who saw him to attain awakening. Furthermore, in the *Introduction* chapter of the *Lotus Sūtra*, after expounding the *Sūtra of Infinite Meanings*, the Buddha sat in the full lotus posture and entered the *Samādhi of the Realm of Infinite Meanings*, his body and mind unmoving. At that time, heavenly mandārava and mañjūṣaka flowers rained down upon all the buddha-worlds, and the earth trembled in six ways—this was the Buddha’s manner of entering samādhi.\n\nThe *Qingliang Mountain Record* states: \"The Ming monk Mingshan initially built a thatched hut in the southern valley of Zhongtai. After many days of receiving alms, someone envious of his prosperity sent an assassin to lodge there for the night. In the dead of night, the assassin peered in and saw Mingshan sitting upright and motionless, his eyes like autumn waters, his breath nearly imperceptible. The assassin knelt in reverence and confessed his sin.\"\n\nNow, his posture of sitting upright and unmoving was precisely the state of entering samādhi; his breath nearly imperceptible did not mean it had ceased, but rather that it had become exceedingly subtle. This was samādhi with breath still present, yet it had already moved the assassin’s heart—such was the marvelous efficacy of samādhi!\n\nThe *Ṣaḍpāramitā Sūtra* states: \"The Buddha’s path is distant and unattainable by ordinary beings. There is but one method that benefits sentient beings: right samādhi. If bodhisattvas have not attained this samādhi, their minds cannot remain pure and unmoving. Birth-and-death and nirvāṇa are without duality. For this reason, to liberate sentient beings, they skillfully employ expedient means, diligently cultivating the corresponding *dhyāna*—the unconditioned wisdom of stillness—like empty space, pure and unstained, eternally unchanging. They further contemplate this samādhi as resembling the full moon, while all delusive thoughts are like floating clouds. Moreover, this right samādhi is like a cool, refreshing breeze, dispelling all clouds and obscurations, radiant and luminous, bringing joy to all sentient beings who behold it. Just as the full moon’s brilliance adorns the world, granting sentient beings coolness and bliss, so too does this stillness of *dhyāna*—the cool breeze—dispel the clouds of delusive thoughts rooted in emptiness. The full moon of right samādhi appears in the world, its great compassionate light extinguishing the fires of afflictions in sentient beings, leading them to the purity and bliss of nirvāṇa.\"\n\nAt that time, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:\n*\"Stillness gives rise to wisdom,\nWisdom accords with principle.\nThe great bodhi of buddhahood\nHas samādhi and prajñā as its roots.\"*\n\nIt further states: \"Those who attain profound spiritual samādhi without dullness thereby awaken the five supernormal powers through this stillness. What are the five? The divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of others’ minds, recollection of past lives, and the power of miraculous transformation.\"\n\nIt also says: \"When bodhisattvas abide in the *Immovable Ground*, they attain true stillness, eliminating sorrow, suffering, joy, and the arising of thoughts, as well as the inhalation and exhalation of breath. Unborn and undying, they dwell in the true Dharma-realm (thus we know that the true samādhi of the Buddha-clan also severs the breath, and only then is it called true stillness). They manifest various miraculous transformations, freely altering their form at will, and none can disturb them—save the Tathāgata, none can destroy them.\"\n\nThe *Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra*, in the *\"Bodhisattva Treasury\" Assembly’s \"Dhyāna Pāramitā\"* chapter, states: \"The samādhi attained by bodhisattvas is supremely profound and wondrous. The bodhisattva abides in it at once, equally gathering and guiding—this state is called *samāhita*. Furthermore, Śāriputra, the samādhi obtained by the bodhisattva through the perfection of stillness is subtle, deep, and sublime, accessible only to wisdom, and is also named *samāpatti*. Śāriputra, such wondrous samādhi is equal to the nature of all dharmas.\"\n\nIt further says: \"Abiding and well-abiding, they attain immovability. In all postures, their minds remain in samādhi, yet they do not discriminate the postures they assume. Their minds are thoroughly refined, delighting in profound samādhi. Unagitated and unexalted, without fluctuation, far removed from dullness, they skillfully recognize all occasions and adapt to the world without mingling with its nature. They transcend the eight worldly concerns—gain and loss, and so forth—untainted by afflictions and delusions. Distant from clamor, far from their usual conduct, they ever rest in equanimity, in the equality of the Dharma-nature, yet without forsaking profound samādhi while engaging in all worldly activities. Śāriputra, it is through the perfection of stillness that bodhisattvas attain such boundless virtues.\"\n\nIt also proclaims:\n*\"Stillness, liberation, and the far shore,\nCultivated through eons of diligent practice.\nTheir minds pure, unstained by defilement,\nUnsullied by worldly dharmas, like the lotus flower.\nGreat samādhi, each pervading illumination,\nThis samādhi, through cultivation, reaches the far shore...\n(omitted passage)\nOr each samādhi as vast, all-pervading illumination,\nThe realm of all buddhas and tathāgatas.\nAttaining such still and tranquil samādhi,\nAnd countless other boundless virtues.\nCultivating stillness to reach the far shore,\nThe bodhisattva’s merits are vast and immeasurable.\nIn motion and stillness, they ever dwell in the realm of stillness,\nTheir minds undisturbed, ever serene.\nWhether walking, lying down, or at rest, they abide in samādhi,\nNo posture exists where they are not in samādhi.\nWithin samādhi, they emit great sounds,\nFor the nature of all dharmas is ever still.\nWithout differentiation, without\n\n\"Of old, Subhūti in tranquil sitting saw heavenly flowers drift in the void.\" During the Five Dynasties, Chan Master Yongming Shou of Mount Tiantai’s Tianzhu Peak practiced samādhi for ninety days, whereupon Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva anointed him with sweet dew, and he attained unobstructed eloquence. In the Sui dynasty, Great Master Zhizhe cultivated the *Lotus Sutra* samādhi; in stillness, he entered samādhi and beheld the assembly at Vulture Peak, as if it had never dispersed. In the Tang, Great Master Sengqie entered samādhi on the wild plains of the Central Terrace of Mount Qingliang, where heavenly flowers gathered about his knees, and he arose only after seven days. The sublime manifestations of samādhi are beyond the ink of oceans to record; here, a mere one or two are cited to inspire faith.\n\nSeventy-Five\nThe Most Wondrous Forgetting\nAt the apex of samādhi, one enters the samādhi of no-mind, unattached to being or non-being—this is wondrous forgetting. Yanzi’s \"sitting in forgetfulness\" transcended form and relinquished knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare; Confucius, in emptiness, exhausted both extremes. This is the forgetting of the Confucian school.\n\nMaster Tan’s *Book of Transformations* states: \"Forget form to nurture qi; forget qi to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.\" Elder Yu Chan said: \"Forgetting form to nurture qi is the golden elixir; facing scenes without emotion is the great return. Forget form, transform qi; transform qi into spirit—thus the Great Dao penetrates the Three Passes.\" Cao Wenyu said: \"Merge into one and forget the one; then may you emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.\" He also said: \"This Dao is easy to know but hard to practice; only when one forgets what is practiced is the Dao complete.\" Sun Bu’er said: \"Qi flows through the Three Isles; spirit forgets and merges with the Great Void.\" She also said: \"Forget spirit, unattached to form; unite with the ultimate, leaving emptiness behind.\" Ancestor Lü said: \"The pine wind intoxicates me with twofold forgetting.\" He also said: \"Cease thoughts, forget scheming, and merge with the natural.\" And: \"In stillness seek the true—true stillness; from forgetting the mind, reach forgetting-forgetting.\" And: \"From this, the solitary spirit silently unites with the Great Void, pure and still, forgetting form.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"Facing scenes, forget emotion and play with moonlight.\" He also said: \"In the immortal’s chamber, qi and blood are utterly forgotten; the precious tripod and golden furnace need not be watched.\" Li Qing’an said: \"Suddenly forget self and others, and the Three Flowers gather.\" He also said: \"In worldly affairs, forget scheming and tasks anew.\" And: \"Harmonizing light and blending with the vulgar, forget self and others; only the self knows what precedes the Emperor of Images.\" Elder Ziyang said: \"Forget circumstances, exhaust emotions, and follow natural truth to realize the forbearance of the unborn dharma.\" The *Ancient Scripture of the Red Writ* states: \"Forget the eyes, and light overflows without limit; forget the ears, and the mind’s awareness abides in profound depths. When both mechanisms are forgotten, the gate to all wonders is cut off.\" The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"When wisdom’s light arises, it becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting.\" This is the forgetting of the Mystery School.\n\nThe Chan Master Huangbo said: \"Forgetting both mind and realm is the true Dharma. Forgetting the realm is easy; forgetting the mind is most difficult.\" Great Master Sengcan said: \"In oneness, embody the mysterious, suddenly forgetting conditions.\" He also said: \"The infinitesimal merges with the vast—this is the realm of forgetting conditions.\" Great Master Zhenjue said: \"Thoughts do not cease without forgetting dust; dust does not cease without stilling thoughts. Forget dust and still thoughts, then forgetting occurs; still thoughts, and dust is forgotten and stilled. Forgetting dust and stilling, there is nothing to still. Stilling thoughts and forgetting, there is nothing to forget. Dust has nothing to oppose; when dust is relinquished, there is no opposition. Nothing to still, thoughts extinguished, not-knowing. The nature of not-knowing differs from wood and stone. This is the place of the initial mind—difficult to comprehend.\"\n\nChan Master Huangpan said: \"Simply still and forget the mind, merge with the Dharma Realm, and attain freedom.\" This is the forgetting of the Chan school. The Chan school must suddenly forget delusion and awakening to penetrate the final barrier, not abiding in initial awakening, obscurely merging with original awakening. The power of the word \"forget\" is most wondrous, its force the greatest. At the apex of cultivation and realization in the Three Teachings, all draw strength from the word \"forget.\" Only through forgetting can subject and object, nature and emptiness be cast off; only through forgetting can emotions cease and views vanish, utterly without inside or outside; only through forgetting can the power of samādhi grow and the embryo of the Dao be perfected.\n\nThe late Master once said: \"If scholars can make the word 'forget' their master, the effects will be like splitting bamboo. Though ten thousand study the Dao, ten thousand do not know—what is most precious is the single word 'forget.'\" Layman Yuanming said: \"In learning worldly matters, without utmost effort of the mind, learning cannot be accomplished; in awakening to the Dharma beyond the world, without utmost effort of no-mind, awakening cannot be thorough.\" How profound these words! The \"utmost effort of no-mind\" refers to the realm of absolute forgetting. Thus, the three times are perfectly interpenetrated, the ten thousand conditions are clarified and still, one enters the wondrous gate of all wonders, and accords with the Great Dao of true constancy.\n\nTrue Man Ziqing’s *Revealing the Secrets of the Mysterious Pass* states: \"Master Tan said: 'Forget form to nurture qi; forget qi to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness.' This single word 'forget' is nothingness. 'Originally, not a single thing—where can dust alight?' Does this not refer to this?\" If one can savor this principle and cultivate the effort of the single word \"forget,\" one can enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao, seize the wondrous functioning of the natural, establish the foundation of the elixir in an instant, and move the transformations of creation within a single body. In his *Commentary on the Treasure Chapters of the Dao and Virtue*, the essentials are to forget things, forget self, forget mind, forget nature, forget form, forget spirit, and forget words—without deep attainment in the Dao, one cannot express this.\n\nCultivating the Dao is not difficult; what is difficult is thorough forgetting. The *Zhuangzi*, throughout, demonstrates the use of the word \"forget.\"\"\n\nAs it is said: \"To nourish the will, forget the form; to nourish the form, forget profit; to attain the Dao, forget the mind.\" Again it says: \"Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\" And again: \"Forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. Those who forget the self are said to enter into Heaven.\" And again: \"Nothing is not nothing, nothing is not being—serene and boundless, all beauties follow from this.\" And again: \"When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praise Yao and blame Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\" And again: \"Who can ascend to Heaven and wander in the mists, stirring and turning without limit, forgetting life together, without end or exhaustion?\" And again: \"The fish-trap exists for the fish—once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit-snare exists for the rabbit—once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for meaning—once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?\" And again: \"Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, abandon all relations with things, and merge with the vast darkness.\" And again: \"One must fast to still the mind. After fasting for three days, one dares not entertain thoughts of reward, rank, or emolument; after five days, one dares not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, skill and clumsiness; after seven days, one suddenly forgets one’s four limbs and physical form.\" And again: \"Forget the feet, and shoes fit well; forget the waist, and the belt fits well. Without inner change or outer compliance, one attains perfect accord with events. From the beginning of accord, one never fails to be in accord—forgetting accord is the true accord.\" And again: \"Forget the liver and gall, disregard the ears and eyes, wander in vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam in the workings of non-action.\" And again: \"Forget years, forget righteousness, rouse oneself in the boundless—thus lodge in the boundless.\" And again: \"In such a state, the mind is forgotten.\" And again: \"Forgetting and returning,\" \"Returning to the source without nourishment, forgetting others—forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person.\" And again: \"It is not that I do not tell you—my mind desires to speak but forgets.\" And again: \"I have served you so thoroughly that I forget, and you have served me so thoroughly that you forget. Though you may worry, what is there to fear? Even if we forget our former selves, there is something I do not forget.\"\n\nZhuangzi may be said to excel in expounding the divine subtleties of the word \"forget.\" Within, forget the liver and gall; without, forget self and others—when nothing is not forgotten, nothing is not possessed. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow from this. If this is not the utmost wonder of the world, what could compare?\n\nIn the *Free and Easy Wandering*, it speaks of the \"perfected person without self\"—this is forgetting the self. In the *Equality of Things and Opinions*, it begins with Nan Guo Ziqi \"responding as if he had lost his counterpart,\" and again says: \"Now I have lost myself\"—this is forgetting the form. In *The Human World*, it reveals the wonder of Yan Hui’s \"fasting of the mind\": \"Before I, Hui, was sent, it was truly myself; once sent, there was no longer myself—can this be called emptiness?\" This is the forgetting of both body and mind. In *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, it speaks of \"putting the world outside, putting things outside, putting life outside\"—this is forgetting everything within and without. It also shows Yan Hui’s \"sitting in forgetfulness,\" merging with the great thoroughfare—this is the sudden realization of the wondrous identity of inner and outer, body and mind, after long forgetting of both. In *Letting Be and Exercising Forbearance*, it reveals \"great unity without self.\" In *Heaven and Earth*, it reveals \"Xiangwang obtaining the pearl\"—all these are the subtle and wondrous workings of the word \"forget.\" Thus, the *Zhuangzi* reaches its summit in the single word \"forget.\" Once one attains the state of forgetting both mind and circumstances, entering the One True Dharma Realm is not difficult.\n\nIn the cultivation of the Mysterious School, stillness is the foundation, and forgetting is the return. Yet if mind and breath are not forgotten, stillness cannot be attained. Thus, it may be said that the entire process of the elixir Way, from beginning to end, can be encompassed in the single word \"forget\"—there is nothing it does not include. When refining essence to transform qi, if one cannot forget the form, one will surely suffer the calamity of essence leakage. When refining qi to transform spirit, if one cannot forget qi, one will surely suffer the calamity of qi leakage. Master Yuchan’s *Poem on Failing to Refine the Elixir* says: \"In the middle of the night, sudden wind and thunder, mist and vapor fill the vast emptiness. Such feelings and flavors—even a mute would bite through his tongue.\" This may serve as a warning from past experience.\n\nWhen refining spirit to return to emptiness, if one cannot forget spirit, one cannot embody the Great Void and attain the wondrous realization of the Dharma Body pervading empty space. Thus, in the \"Transformation of the Dao\" chapter of Tanzi’s *Book of Transformation*, the three stages of cultivation—nourishing qi, nourishing spirit, and nourishing emptiness—are all subsumed under the single word \"forget.\" No one who has spoken profoundly of the Mysterious School through the ages has matched this in subtlety and wondrous simplicity.\n\nGenerally speaking, in both precelestial cultivation and postcelestial arts, if one does not reach the state of forgetting, transformation cannot occur. Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says: \"You are about to forget your spirit and qi—then you may approach it!\" Is this not the meaning of Cao Wenyi’s words: \"Merge into one (mind and breath interdependent), then forget the one (forget both mind and breath)—thus may one emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation\"?\n\nScholars of the Mysterious School know only the wonder of mind and breath merging as one, yet they do not know that forgetting both mind and breath is the wonder within wonder—for without forgetting, there can be no stillness. Profound and subtle indeed!\n\nRegarding the fire phases of the Mysterious School, if one were to summarize their essentials in a single word, they may be divided into four stages: first, harmony; next, intoxication; then, stillness; and finally, forgetting.\n\nYet harmony is never without stillness, stillness is never without intoxication, and intoxication is never without forgetting. Observe the utterly drunk: when they fall from a carriage to the ground, they suffer no injury—precisely because, in drunkenness, both mind and breath are forgotten. If this is true even for the postnatal, how much more so for the prenatal! Thus, though four words are given, they may in truth interpenetrate and merge. Ah! The essentials of Daoist cultivation are here laid bare.\n\nMaster Yulin Xiu, a great Chan monk of the early Qing, composed a work titled *Questions from a Guest*, in which he exhaustively extolled the word *forgetting*. He declared: “One who cannot forget the body cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget the mind cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget the world cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget fame cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget profit cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget wife and children cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget household and career cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget knowledge and views cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget learning and habit cannot study the Dao.” Only when body and mind, inner and outer, are all forgotten together—when all is relinquished at once, and the dusty world is wholly forgotten—does one daily draw nearer to the Dao.\n\nIn the Mysterious School’s initial practice of interdependent mind and breath, if one does not reach the stage of dual forgetting, one cannot even fall asleep—if sleep is unattainable, how much less stillness? Thus, *forgetting* is most wondrous, *forgetting* is most sublime!\n\n---\n\n**76. Leisure is Most Precious**\n\nWhat is leisure? It is the state of body and mind at ease, free from the disturbance of miscellaneous toil and vexation, and imbued with a sense of serene contentment. As the *Zhuangzi* says: “Can you be together without contrivance? Be bland and still? Be vast and clear? Be harmonious and at leisure?” This expresses the meaning.\n\nGenerally, the study of the Dao encompasses three kinds of leisurely delight. The first is *tranquil leisure*: when the practitioner externally quiets all conditions, single-mindedly enters meditation, and internally generates a stillness of pure peace, putting an end to the disturbance of worldly toil—this is the true beginning of entering the Dao. The second is *secluded leisure*: as poetry speaks of the “recluse,” one retreats to the peaks and riverbanks, delights in one’s own aspirations, seeks neither fame nor advancement, contends not with kings and lords, and spends each day in carefree ease—moving with the white clouds in their unfolding and closing, sharing the unbounded freedom of waterfowl. Such is the “idle Daoist.” Once the foundation of the elixir is attained, one may preserve and nurture the sacred embryo, living for decades as a lofty hermit—yet only those who have seen through glory and set their hearts on simplicity can achieve this.\n\nLong ago, Chan Master Zuoxi Shanlang wrote to Chan Master Yongjia Jue during their mountain retreat: “Since arriving at Lingxi, my mind and will have been at peace. I wander with my staff among the high and low peaks, sit in meditation in stone chambers and cliffside niches, where green pines and azure pools give rise to their own moonlight. The wind sweeps the white clouds, and my gaze stretches a thousand miles. Fragrant flowers and ripe fruits are brought by the beaks of mountain birds; the cries of gibbons echo near and far. My hoe serves as a pillow, fine grass as my mat. The world’s strife and contention over self and others—only those whose hearts have not yet awakened engage in such things. If you have a moment, I hope you will visit.” This reveals the purport of *secluded leisure*!\n\nThe third is *pure leisure*. Chen Tuan wrote: “I see the world’s people busy—each as frantic as fire. Yet those who toil do not do so for themselves; if they toiled for themselves, it would be acceptable.” Shao Yaofu said: “A thousand miles cannot escape the clarity of two eyes; in a hundred years, not one person is seen at leisure.” And again: “Flowing water follows its course, the scene ever still; flowers fall frequently, yet the mind remains at ease. Unlike worldly people, who age in idleness, never once in their lives breaking into a smile.” Zhou Maoshu remarked: “In the red dust and white sun, no one is at leisure—how much less one bound by official robes and sashes!” Chen Baisha observed: “Both marketplace and mountains have their affairs; what modern people call busy, the ancients called leisure.” Clearly, the blessing of *pure leisure* is most difficult to attain.\n\nWorldly people rush about day after day, year after year in tumult, with never a moment’s respite for body or mind. Only Daoists enjoy the blessing of pure stillness and leisure. Thus, an ancient worthy said: “Among the toils of life, only monks are free from affairs. If one awakens to the true vehicle, one grows even more at leisure in old age. In a garden with three paths, the Chan nature remains; in a thatched hut, the Dao mind returns with the wind and moon.” The Qing Emperor Shizu declared: “A hundred years—thirty-six thousand days—cannot compare to half a day’s leisure for a monk.” Master Yuchan wrote: “There is but one thing in which I surpass others: even emperors lack this pure leisure.”\n\nTo enjoy the blessing of *pure leisure* stems from having no desires in the breast, releasing the mind into utter emptiness. Thus, one can withdraw, return to the mountains, dwell in tranquil seclusion, rest in serene stability, and abide in boundless harmony—where wondrous function is naturally sufficient. Chan Master Weizhong Fu wrote: “After Zhang Liang no longer prized his noble title, how could he bear to record his merits on the imperial tower? Winning a leisurely body with nothing to do, he often wandered by the water with Red Pine.” This is what Chan Master Yongjia Xuanyue called “the idle Daoist who has abandoned learning and effort.”\n\nAn ancient worthy said: “The ‘idle Daoist’ is one who accords with the Dao, unconstrained by worldly toil. His eyes roam through the ages, his mind rests in a single realm. By water and beneath trees, he nurtures the sacred embryo, finding freedom in the moonlight, at ease in the sound of springs—thus is he called the ‘idle Daoist who has abandoned learning and effort.’”\n\nIn the Song dynasty, Chao Wenyuan’s *Fragments of Gold* states: “Someone asked: What is the joy of living in leisure? I replied: It is to harmonize and smooth the qi of Great Harmony, to savor the flavor of Heavenly Truth, to study subtle and profound words, to wander in the most wondrous Dao, to share the lofty sentiments of Master Zhuang, to befriend the transformations of nature, to grasp the sublime teachings of India, and to refine the spirit.”\n\nI say: If one can still both thoughts and extinguish them, wandering in the realm of *wuheyou* (“nothing whatsoever”), roaming in the vastness of *Fenghong*—this is indeed the ultimate journey of Zhuangzi’s “forgetting and ease.”\n\nThe difficulty of leisure lies precisely in achieving leisure of both body and mind. If the body is at leisure while the mind is not—thoughts surging like tides, friends and concerns crowding the heart—this cannot truly be called leisure. Those of higher attainment may have a mind at leisure while the body is not, as when Confucius journeyed through the states; yet even this does not compare to Vimalakīrti’s illness in Vaiśālī. When both body and mind are at leisure, as when the World-Honored One rests in the ocean of *mahāparinirvāṇa*, this is the highest state.\n\nLü Dongbin said: “A day of pure leisure is a day as an immortal; the six spirits harmonize and all is naturally at peace.” Master Yinshan said: “In a three-room thatched hut I have always dwelt; a single ray of spiritual light makes all realms at leisure.” Chan Master Yongming Yanshou said: “Best is when in stillness nothing stirs, and the sprout of the Dao grows effortlessly alone”—he was called the “Master of No Affairs,” a rare attainment indeed. Leisure of both body and mind is most conducive to the practice of the Dao. When the mind and breath are harmonized, one wanders in the realm of *wuheyou* (“nothing whatsoever”), the state of *xiyi* (“rare and subtle”), which Zhuangzi called “wandering in Heaven.” Zhi Gong said: “In the light of formlessness, one is ever at ease.” Yuanwu said: “Entering the realm of equality and tranquility,” and again: “Together entering the dharma-nature ocean of non-action and no-affairs.” These are all the subtle principles of “wandering in Heaven,” and so *Zhuangzi* says: “Without the Heavenly wandering of the mind, the six senses vie in confusion.”\n\nWhen external circumstances do not disturb, the body is at peace; when the inner mind is still, the heart is at peace. Leisure of body and mind is the foundation of entering the Dao; emptiness and stillness of body and mind are its beginning. Only through stillness can samādhi arise, and in all cases, leisure is the condition for entering the Dao. Dongshan said: “Releasing all, sit upright; white clouds deeply enter leisure.” This is the leisurely spirit of Chan. Lü Dongbin said: “Do not say the recluse has nothing to do—within leisure lies the work of stillness. After reading in the quiet of a closed room by day, sweep the floor, burn incense until dusk.” *Zhuangzi* said: “In such a state, the mind is at leisure and without affairs.” Master Yuchan said: “A single leisurely guest, with nothing weighing on the heart.” Su Dongpo said: “The perfected one awakens to a single word: the Dao gathers from inner emptiness. The mind at leisure reflects itself, bright as a lotus.” Zhang Sanfeng said: “Stillness disturbed is not true stillness; only in leisure can one find peace.” This is the leisurely spirit of the Esoteric Dao.\n\nShao Yaofu said: “In leisure, the flavor is true; in truth, one is a child of Heaven.” And again: “In leisure, observe the waxing and waning of years; in stillness, illumine the being and non-being of heaven and earth.” And again: “Observe human affairs from the stillness of embodiment; refine the emotions of things in the freedom of leisure. Dispel all waves to preserve the still water—what in the world cannot be made level?” Zhou Maoshu said: “Only in leisure is one a man of understanding; busyness is but a life of toil.” Wang Yangming said: “In leisure, the mind is like empty water; in stillness, the subtle workings of Heaven become visible.” This is the leisurely spirit of the Confucians.\n\nOur Buddha, the World-Honored One, having realized bodhi, dwells in constant bliss—this is the ultimate tranquility. **77. Retreat is most steadfast.**\n\nThe *Xugua Zhuan* of the *Book of Changes* says: “Retreat means withdrawal.” The *Dun* hexagram states: “Good retreat brings good fortune to the noble person, but not to the petty person.” And again: “Excellent retreat is steadfast and auspicious; abundant retreat brings no disadvantage.” The *Xiangci* of the *Daguo* hexagram says: “The noble person stands alone without fear, retreats from the world without vexation.” The *Zhongyong* says: “The noble person abides in the Mean; though unseen in retreat, he does not regret—only the sage can do this.” The Confucian tradition extols the virtue of reclusion to the utmost.\n\nIn the *Daodejing*, “wearing coarse cloth while holding jade” is retreat; “achieving merit and fame, then withdrawing the body” is retreat; “blending one’s light and merging with the dust” is also retreat. Yet these are but the actions of one who retreats from the world, not the ultimate retreat. When the spirit of the self enters the cavern of qi to nurture it, withdrawing and concealing in secrecy, ultimately transforming together with breath, entering true emptiness, returning to the Great Void—body and mind utterly still, roots and realms both within and without extinguished—this may be called retreat of both body and mind, utterly without trace, leaving no footprint, like the horn of the antelope hanging in the air. This is the ultimate retreat, and the *Book of Changes*’ “excellent retreat” and “abundant retreat” also contain this meaning.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: “The Gate of Heaven is non-being; within the non-being of non-being, the sage conceals himself.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Returning to the hidden origin, the inner light illumines the body.” And again: “Between the dark and the new moon, the tally moves within; the primordial chaos of *hongmeng*, the union of yin and yang, fluids moistening and flowing, circulating without obstruction. The spirits of heaven and earth are beyond measure; their use is to secure the body, concealing form and hiding.” Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* says: “Conceal the heart in the abyss, beautifying the spiritual root.” This is the true work of retreat and concealment in the Esoteric Dao—not merely dwelling in mountain forests where no human trace reaches.\n\n**78. Compassion is most auspicious.**\n\nAmong the Three Treasures of the Old Sage, compassion comes first. It is said: “Through compassion, one becomes brave.” And again: “With compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense. Heaven will save him, guarding him with compassion.” And again: “Thus the sage is always good at saving people, and so leaves no one behind; always good at saving things, and so leaves nothing behind. The sage in the world is reverent, blending the hearts of all under heaven. The hundred clans fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.”\n\nIt is also said: “Repay resentment with virtue. For the good, I treat them with goodness; for the ungood, I also treat them with goodness—thus virtue is perfected in goodness.” All this illustrates the practice of the great compassion samādhi. The bodhisattva cultivates the Four Immeasurables (loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity), yet takes compassion as the foremost guide, which suffices to prove the shared ground between Buddhism and Daoism. Those who study the immortal arts extend benevolence even to insects, refraining from harming any sentient being. With a compassionate heart, they embrace all beings, teaching and transforming them according to their capacities, gradually leading them out of the苦海 of birth and death to ascend the shore of the Dao. In this way, they embody the gateway of the Old Sage’s great compassion, becoming the upright banner of the teachings beneath the pillar.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Departure from the Worldly” chapter expounds ten kinds of compassion, which may serve as the paradigm for the great compassion practices of both Buddhism and Daoism, and as the bridge for guiding beings in the degenerate age. The sūtra states:\n\n“The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of pure compassion. What are the ten?\n1. **Compassion of equal mind**, pure because it universally embraces all beings without discrimination;\n2. **Compassion of bestowing benefit**, pure because whatever is done brings joy;\n3. **Compassion of regarding beings as oneself**, pure because it ultimately leads all out of birth and death;\n4. **Compassion of not abandoning the world**, pure because the mind constantly contemplates the accumulation of good roots;\n5. **Compassion that brings about liberation**, pure because it universally enables beings to eradicate all afflictions;\n6. **Compassion that gives rise to bodhi**, pure because it universally inspires beings to seek the mind of omniscience;\n7. **Compassion unhindered by the world**, pure because it radiates great light, illuminating all equally;\n8. **Compassion that fills empty space**, pure because it saves and protects beings without fail, wherever they may be;\n9. **Compassion bound to the Dharma**, pure because it realizes the true suchness of reality;\n10. **Compassion without conditions**, pure because it enters bodhi, free from the nature of birth.\n\nThese are the ten. All bodhisattvas who abide in this Dharma attain the Tathāgata’s supreme, vast, and pure compassion.”\n\nI observe: When the Old Sage says, “For the good, I treat them with goodness; for the ungood, I also treat them with goodness,” is this not “universally embracing all beings without discrimination”? When it is said, “Always good at saving people, and so leaves no one behind; always good at saving things, and so leaves nothing behind,” is this not “saving and protecting beings without fail, wherever they may be”? When it speaks of “blending the hearts of all under heaven,” restoring them to the uncarved simplicity of infancy and the unfeeling innocence of a newborn, is this not the “compassion of not abandoning the world”? When it says, “Constant virtue does not depart; constant virtue does not err, returning to the limitless, returning to nothingness,” is this not the “compassion that brings about liberation”? When it teaches, “Without knowledge, without desire, revealing the plain and embracing the uncarved, purifying to become the norm under heaven—who can stir the turbid to gradually clear?” and further, “Attain the utmost emptiness, guard the profound stillness; while the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return. Things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life; returning to life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination,” is this not the “compassion bound to the Dharma”? When it speaks of “dwelling in good earth, the mind like a deep abyss, befriending goodness, speaking with sincerity, governing with uprightness, handling affairs with skill, and acting at the right time”—these seven all exemplify “the highest goodness is like water, which benefits the ten thousand things without contention, accomplishing its work yet not dwelling in it”—is this not the “compassion without conditions”? Thus, the gateway of the Old Sage’s great compassion practice aligns in secret with the *Avataṃsaka*.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Entry into the Dharma Realm” chapter, when the youth Sudhana visits the eighteenth kalyāṇamitra, King Great Light in the city of Wondrous Light, he is taught the gateway of the great compassion banner, which deeply accords with the Old Master’s principle of “taking great compassion as foremost, relieving suffering and bestowing joy.” From this, one may also perceive the wondrous responsiveness of great compassion, which transcends the reach of thought and discourse—truly, it is the Buddha’s supreme virtue in transforming others. The sūtra states:\n\nAt that time, the king declared: “Good son, I have purely cultivated the bodhisattva’s practice of the great compassion banner; I have fulfilled the bodhisattva’s practice of the great compassion banner. Good son, in the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas, beyond reckoning or description, I inquired into this Dharma, pondered, observed, cultivated, and adorned it. Good son, I take this Dharma as my sovereign; with this Dharma, I instruct; with this Dharma, I embrace; with this Dharma, I follow the world; with this Dharma, I guide beings; with this Dharma, I lead beings to cultivate practice; with this Dharma, I lead beings to enter the path; with this Dharma, I provide expedient means; with this Dharma, I inspire beings to be imbued; with this Dharma, I arouse beings to action; with this Dharma, I establish beings in contemplating the self-nature of all dharmas; with this Dharma, I establish beings in the mind of compassion. Taking compassion as the foundation, perfecting the power of compassion, I thus enable them to abide in benefit. With a mind of joy, a mind of pity, a mind of embrace, a mind of guarding beings without abandonment, a mind of tirelessly relieving the suffering of beings—through this Dharma, I enable all beings to attain ultimate bliss, ever delighting in themselves, as if their bodies were free from all suffering, their minds purified, cutting off the craving for birth and death, delighting in the joy of the true Dharma, washing away the defilements of afflictions, shattering the obstructions of evil karma, severing the flow of birth and death, entering the ocean of true Dharma, cutting off all attachments, seeking omniscience, purifying the ocean of the mind, and generating unshakable faith. Good son, I have abided in this practice of the great compassion banner and am able to teach and transform the world with the true Dharma. Good son, in my land, all beings have no fear of me. Good son, if there are beings who are poor and destitute, coming to me with requests, I open my treasuries and storehouses, allowing them to take freely, saying to them: ‘Do not commit evil, do not harm beings, do not arise views, do not generate attachments. You who are poor and lacking—if there is anything you need, come to me and to the four directions; all things, in great variety and abundance, are here for you to take as you wish. Do not hesitate or doubt.’”\n\n\"Good son, in this land, when the world is in the Five Defilements, all beings delight in committing various evils. My heart grieves with compassion and desires to save and protect them, so I enter the gateway of the bodhisattva’s samādhi, with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world. When I enter this samādhi, all the fearful, afflictive, demonic, and contentious minds of those beings instantly vanish. Why is this so? Because when one enters the bodhisattva’s samādhi with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world, the Dharma is thus.\n\nGood son, wait but a moment, and you shall witness it yourself. Then King Great Light entered this samādhi, and within his city, six kinds of tremors arose. The jeweled ground, jeweled walls, jeweled halls, jeweled palaces, terraces, pavilions, towers, stairways, doors, and windows—all emitted wondrous sounds, each bowing in reverence toward the king. All the inhabitants of the Radiant Light City simultaneously rejoiced and leapt with joy, prostrating themselves before the king. From villages, encampments, and cities, all people came to see the king, rejoicing and bowing in reverence. Even the birds and beasts near the king’s dwelling gazed at one another, arousing minds of compassion, and all bowed in reverence before the king. Every mountain, plain, and all grasses and trees turned toward the king in reverence. Ponds, pools, springs, wells, rivers, and seas all surged and overflowed, flowing before the king. Ten thousand dragon kings raised great clouds of fragrance, flashing lightning and rumbling thunder, pouring down a fine, gentle rain. Ten thousand deva kings—such as King Śakra of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, King Yama of the Suyāma Heaven, King Tuṣita of the Tuṣita Heaven, King Nirmāṇarati of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven, and King Paranirmitavaśavartin of the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven—led the host, playing wondrous music in the sky. Countless celestial maidens sang praises, raining down clouds of innumerable flowers, clouds of incense, clouds of jeweled garlands, clouds of jeweled robes, clouds of jeweled canopies, and clouds of jeweled banners, adorning the sky in offering to the king. The great elephant king Airāvaṇa, by his sovereign power, spread countless jeweled lotus flowers in the sky, hanging countless jeweled necklaces, jeweled ribbons, jeweled garlands, jeweled ornaments, jeweled flowers, and jeweled incense, adorned with all manner of wondrous embellishments. Countless celestial maidens sang praises in various melodies.\n\nWithin Jambudvīpa, there were further countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of rākṣasa kings, yakṣa kings, kumbhāṇḍa kings, and piśāca kings—some dwelling in the great seas, others on land, drinking blood and devouring flesh, harming beings—yet all aroused minds of compassion, wishing to act for the benefit of others, clearly discerning future lives, refraining from evil, and joining their palms in reverence, bowing their heads to the king. Just as in Jambudvīpa, so too in the other three continents, and even throughout the three-thousand great-thousand worlds, extending to the ten directions in hundreds of thousands of myriads of nayutas of worlds, all poisonous and evil beings were likewise transformed.\"\n\nThe great compassion banner practice cultivated by King Great Light, and the great compassion samādhi he entered, moved even grasses, trees, birds, and beasts to bow in reverence. Towers and jeweled pavilions emitted wondrous sounds in praise, bowing in reverence—truly inconceivable. For when compassion pervades the world, both sentient and insentient beings throughout the world are moved without exception. The power of the mind is boundless, and thus the power of compassion is boundless. The mutual resonance of response and Dao is beyond all reckoning.\n\nIn the degenerate age of the final kalpa, when strife and conflict are entrenched, humans slaughter one another, blood flows like a river, and bombardments reduce cities to ruins—apart from taking the bodhisattva’s gateway of practice, with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world, how else could one transform their poisonous minds, avert this great calamity, and restore harmony among all beings?\n\nConfucius said, *\"Repay resentment with uprightness, and repay virtue with virtue.\"* Yet Laozi taught, *\"Repay resentment with virtue,\"* treating friend and foe equally. Thus, the compassion of the sage Laozi surpasses that of the sage Confucius, equaling that of the Buddha, the World-Honored One.\n\nWhen the Perfected One Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty had completed his Daoist cultivation and awaited the imperial summons for his ascension, the summons was long delayed. One day, two azure youths and a white crane descended from the sky. The Perfected One thought the celestial decree had arrived, but one youth proclaimed an edict from the Most High, summoning Huan Kai to ascend to heaven—not Tao. At that time, Kai was serving the Perfected One Tao. Tao then said to him, *\"I have cultivated the Dao with utmost diligence. Why this prolonged delay in the world? I wish you to inquire on my behalf.\"* Three days later, Kai descended again to Tao’s chamber and said, *\"Your hidden merits are manifest. In compiling the *Bencao* (Materia Medica), you used gadflies and leeches as medicine. Though your work benefits people, it harms living creatures, and thus your ascension is delayed. After another twelve years, you shall be released.\"* The Perfected One then composed a separate *Bencao* using only herbs and plants that could replace living creatures. Later, he indeed achieved liberation through the body.\n\nThe Perfected One Sun Simiao of the Tang dynasty compiled the *Qianjin Fang* (Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold). A celestial being descended and said to him, *\"The prescriptions you have compiled harm living creatures. You shall become an immortal through liberation of the body, but you will not ascend lightly.\"* Sun Simiao then replaced the gadflies and leeches with herbs and plants, composing the *Qianjin Yifang* (Supplement to the Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold) in thirty scrolls.\n\nConsider this: if killing even the smallest creatures to save people runs counter to the will of Heaven, how much more so does the slaughter of fattened animals to fill one’s belly? The sage Laozi taught people to be compassionate toward others, urging them to always save living beings. Yet if one kills living creatures to fill the kitchen, does this not greatly contradict his teachings? Those who learn from the sage Laozi’s teachings on longevity but disregard his compassion toward others act out of selfishness and self-interest, their virtue deficient. They shall never succeed—this can be stated with certainty.\n\nFormerly, Master Wang told me: \"In cultivating oneself, emptiness and quiescence are the fundamental principle; in conducting oneself in the world, benevolence and compassion are the essentials. Yet what is called benevolence and compassion also divides into active and passive forms. Active compassion lies in relieving suffering and bestowing joy, in delivering and aiding sentient beings; passive compassion merely refrains from afflicting or harming any sentient being and restrains all actions that would disadvantage them. Mencius said: 'A man must first refrain from certain actions before he can act.' Thus, only by practicing passive compassion—refraining from afflicting all sentient beings—can one then relieve suffering and bestow joy, practicing active compassion with full strength. Beginners in compassionate practice may first cultivate passive compassion.\"\n\n**79. Sincerity Is Most Potent**\nMy late master taught: \"In cultivating the Dao, one must attain utmost sincerity and single-minded focus. This character *cheng* (sincerity) cannot be transmitted even between father and son, let alone between master and disciple. At the extreme of sincerity, even metal and stone yield.\" *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"There has never been one who remained unmoved by utmost sincerity; without sincerity, none can move others. Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can effect transformation, for utmost sincerity is spirit-like.\"\n\nI say: Sincerity is the true and real mind. Utmost sincerity is the mind’s essence concentrated into oneness, untouched by extraneous thoughts. It proceeds without calculating fortune or misfortune, gain or loss, harm or benefit, never looking back. With unwavering single-mindedness, it possesses the three powers of the mind: great faith, great courage, and great stability. When the firing process reaches this stage, the eight winds cannot shake it. The mind’s essence becomes dense and aligned, achieving unimpeded communion. Thus, it can resonate with the Dao and interact without obstruction. Without the mind of utmost sincerity, one can never achieve the Dao. This is the sole provision for the path to the Dao. All past sages and worthies perfected the Dao’s fruit within this. Scholars ought to set their minds to it!\n\n*The Perfect Wanderer’s \"True Admonitions\"* states: \"Once there was a man who loved the Dao but did not know its methods. Day and night, he faced a cypress tree and bowed to it, seeking longevity. After twenty-eight years, the tree blossomed abundantly, its sweetness like malt sugar. He ate of it and became an immortal. Some bowed to Mount Taihua and received the Dao from the Old Man of the Western Peak; others bowed to the Yellow River, and after ten years, the River Earl taught them the method of walking on water without drowning. There is no other reason for this—it is the power of utmost sincerity.\" Examples like Wang Xiang lying on ice to catch a carp or Geng Gong praying to a well to draw forth water are also cases of utmost sincerity. When the light of the mind is concentrated and unshaken, whether in movement or stillness, it can move things and achieve communion. This is what Buddhism calls \"the three realms are only mind.\"\n\n*The Book of Master Lie*’s \"Emperor Huang\" chapter relates: \"The Fan family had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state admired him, and he was favored by the Lord of Jin. Though he did not hold office, he ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state ennobled; whatever he spoke ill of, the state demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court’s officials. Zihua had his retainers attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, bully the weak, and though they were wounded before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his amusement, and the state nearly became accustomed to it.\n\nTwo men, He Sheng and Zi Bo, discussed Zihua’s fame and power, saying he could make the living die and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. He borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s disciples were all from noble families, dressed in fine silk and riding grand carriages, walking slowly with haughty gazes. Seeing Shang Qiu Kai—old, weak, dark-faced, and poorly dressed—they all sneered at him. Soon, they mocked and deceived him, stopping at nothing. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks were simple, exhausted by their taunts.\n\nThen, they all ascended a high terrace. Amid the crowd, someone casually said: 'Whoever can throw themselves down will be rewarded with a hundred gold.' The crowd all clamored to comply. Shang Qiu Kai believed it was true and jumped first. His form soared like a bird, landing lightly on the ground without injury. The Fan family’s followers thought it a coincidence and did not yet find it strange.\n\nThey then pointed to a deep bend in the river and said: 'There is a treasure pearl in there; you can swim to retrieve it.' Shang Qiu Kai again swam after it. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to suspect. Zihua then ordered that he be given meat, fine clothes, and silk. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan family’s storehouse. Zihua said: 'Whoever can enter the fire to retrieve brocade will be rewarded according to how much they bring out.' Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the flames. Not a speck of dust clung to him, nor was his body scorched.\n\nThe Fan family’s followers, believing him to possess the Dao, all apologized: 'We did not know you possessed the Dao and deceived you; we did not know you were a divine person and humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, or blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?'\"\n\nShang Qiu Kai said: \"I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I know not how this came to be. Yet there is one thing—let me try to speak of it to you.\n\nOnce, two guests lodged at my home and spoke in praise of the Fan family’s power, saying they could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them without doubt, and so I came without hesitation. When I arrived, I took your followers’ words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not sincere enough, that my actions fell short. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay—I simply focused my heart, and nothing opposed me. That was all.\n\nToday, I realize your followers deceived me. Within, I harbored suspicion; without, I clung to appearances and perceptions. Now, recalling how I once escaped unscorched and undrowned, I burn with shame and tremble with dread. How could I ever again draw near to water or fire?\"\n\nFrom then on, the disciples of the Fan family, whenever they encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, dared not humiliate them, but would alight from their carriages to bow.\n\nZai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said: \"Did you not know?\"\n\nThe person of utmost sincerity can move all things. Stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without obstruction—how could this be limited to treading perilous paths or entering water and fire? If even Shang Qiu Kai, deceived by false things, remained unobstructed, how much more so when both self and other are sincere? Take heed, disciples!\n\nThis passage describes the efficacy of perfect sincerity, all arising from the congealing of the heart’s light and the singularity of focused sincerity. For those who cultivate the Dao, when the firing times reach this stage, the elixir may be formed. Shang Qiu Kai could cast himself to the ground unharmed, swim through water without drowning, and enter fire without scorching—all because his body and mind remained unmoved, so that events merged with principle and things could not oppose him. This is what is meant by \"harmony enters the great sameness with things.\"\n\nAlas! The function of sincerity is indeed supreme.\n\n---\n\nThe eighty-first chapter, *Hui Zui Chao* (Supreme Wisdom)\n\nSincerity is the congealing of the heart’s essence into oneness, without falling into a second thought—this belongs to the power of concentration. When concentration reaches its peak, illumination arises, and unimpeded wisdom manifests. This is the power of wisdom.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Correctness leads to stillness, stillness to clarity, clarity to emptiness.\" It also says: \"That and this find no counterpart—this is called the pivot of the Dao. When the pivot is grasped at the center of the circle, it can respond to the infinite. This is one infinity, that is another infinity—thus it is said: nothing compares to clarity.\" Again: \"When one follows the inner communication of the ears and eyes while transcending the knowledge of the heart-mind, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so humans? This is the transformation of the ten thousand things.\" And: \"Only after one has transcended life externally can one attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, one can see the solitary. Seeing the solitary, one can transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, one can enter the realm of neither birth nor death.\"\n\nThe commentary states: Clarity, penetration, and morning clarity—all are states where wisdom arises. Clarity is the radiance of the heart’s light, illuminating all dharmas with perfect illumination—this is the wondrous luminosity of original wisdom. With original wisdom, all realms are pervaded and embraced without obstruction or stagnation. When realm and wisdom interpenetrate, self and other become identical, allowing one to transform adversity and prosperity, life and death, at will—all perfectly fitting. This is the wondrous function of the center of the circle, enabling one to respond to conditions and interact with beings with infinite transformation.\n\nIn the *Great Master* chapter, this is also called \"Zhan Ming\" (Illuminating Clarity), referring to this same wondrous luminosity. Moreover, \"the inner communication of the ears and eyes\" signifies the perfect realization of the one mind, while \"transcending the knowledge of the heart-mind\" means departing from the deluded knowledge of the six senses. This is the true state where wisdom arises—seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, the six senses restored, different natures merging into sameness, the solitary radiance of spiritual light transcending the roots and dust. This is what is called true knowing.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Only after there is a true person is there true knowing; knowing arises from not-knowing.\" Guan Yinzi says: \"Knowing yet forgetting emotion, being capable yet not acting—this is true knowing and true capability.\" I note: The phrase \"knowing yet forgetting emotion\" deeply accords with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s principle of \"knowing without seeing, which is the untainted purity of nirvāṇa.\" The phrase \"knowing arises from not-knowing\" especially resonates with the Chan school’s saying of \"the first glimmer of awareness in the skull without perception.\" This is indeed the crux of the Daoist school’s wisdom and the ultimate teaching of Lao-Zhuang’s mind-ground Dharma.\n\nThus, the Chan master Sanping’s verse says:\n*\"This seeing and hearing are not the mind’s hearing,\nNo other colors or sounds can be presented to you.\nWithin this, if you fully understand, all is settled—\nSubstance and function pose no obstacle, whether divided or undivided.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One Miaozheng says: \"Only when seeing and hearing are extinguished within seeing can one attain the great rest.\" The Perfected One Ziyang says: \"When encountering realms, if the mind is absent, only then can one see the face of bodhi.\" All these express the profound principle of \"knowing yet forgetting emotion.\"\n\nSuch clear seeing of one’s nature is true wisdom, also called the wisdom of thusness, untainted wisdom, unstained wisdom, unmoving wisdom, the wisdom of all-wisdom, and the wisdom of self-awakened sagacity. The *Lotus Sūtra* states: \"The Tathāgata appears in the world to open, show, awaken, and cause entry into the Buddha’s knowledge and vision\"—this refers precisely to this. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *Departing the Worldly* chapter says:\n\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of discriminating wisdom. What are the ten? They are: the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among sentient beings, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among faculties, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of karmic retribution, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of rebirth, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among worlds, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among buddhas, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among dharmas, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of the three times, and the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of all languages and paths—these are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the Tathāgata’s supreme, vast, and boundless discriminating wisdom.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of wisdom that follow awakening. What are the ten? They are: the wisdom that follows awakening to the immeasurable distinctions of all worlds, the wisdom that follows awakening to the inconceivable distinctions among all sentient beings, the wisdom that follows awakening to all dharmas entering one into many and many into one, the wisdom that follows awakening to the vastness of the entire dharma realm, the wisdom that follows awakening to the ultimate nature of all space, the wisdom that follows awakening to all worlds entering the past, the wisdom that follows awakening to all worlds entering the present and future, the wisdom that follows awakening to all the immeasurable vows and practices of the tathāgatas being perfectly fulfilled in one wisdom, and the wisdom that follows awakening to all buddhas of the three times attaining liberation through the same practice—these are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the autonomous luminosity of all dharmas, fulfilling all vows in a single thought-moment, instantly comprehending all buddha-dharmas, and attaining perfect enlightenment.\"\n\nIt further states:\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of wisdom that give birth to wisdom. What are the ten?\"\n\nThe ten kinds of wisdom that give birth to wisdom are as follows:\n\nThe wisdom that knows how all sentient beings attain liberation,\nThe wisdom that knows the various distinctions among all buddha-realms,\nThe wisdom that knows the divisions of the ten-directional net,\nThe wisdom that knows the arising of all worlds—whether inverted or upright,\nThe wisdom that knows all dharmas, their one nature, their various natures, and their vast abiding,\nThe wisdom that knows the arising of all kinds of bodies,\nThe wisdom that knows all dharmas ultimately attain liberation through the one Dao,\nThe wisdom that knows the tathāgata’s divine power enters all dharma-realms,\nThe wisdom that knows the buddha-nature of all sentient beings in the three times is unbroken—\nthese are the ten.\n\nIf bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they comprehend all within it without exception.\n\nIt further states:\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi wisdom vast as the ocean. What are the ten?\n\nEntering all immeasurable realms of sentient beings—this is the first ocean-like wisdom.\nEntering all worlds without discrimination—this is the second ocean-like wisdom.\nKnowing the immeasurable, unimpeded vastness of all space, universally entering the ten directions and all differentiated world-nets—this is the third ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva skillfully enters the dharma-realm, that is: unimpeded entry, unbroken entry, non-abiding entry, immeasurable entry, unborn entry, undying entry, all-pervading entry, and complete comprehension—this is the fourth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva fully comprehends all the roots of goodness accumulated by buddhas, bodhisattvas, dharma-teachers, voice-hearers, solitary realizers, and all ordinary beings in the past, present, and future—whether already accumulated, presently accumulating, or to be accumulated in the future—as well as all the roots of goodness of the three-time buddhas in their attainment of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi—whether already attained, presently attaining, or to be attained—and all the roots of goodness from the three-time buddhas’ teachings and subduing of all sentient beings—whether already taught, presently teaching, or to be taught—this is the fifth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva, in each thought-moment, enters the past for incalculable eons. In a single eon, there may be a hundred koṭis of buddhas appearing, a hundred thousand koṭis of buddhas appearing, or an uncountable, immeasurable, boundless, incomparable, innumerable, inconceivable, unmeasurable, inexpressible number of buddhas appearing—even an inexpressible, inexpressible number beyond all calculation. All such tathāgatas arise in the world, along with their assemblies at the bodhimaṇḍa, their voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, their teachings and subduing of beings, the lifespans of all beings, and the duration of the Dharma—all of this is clearly perceived. Just as in one eon, so too in all eons. Even in eons without buddhas, all sentient beings who plant roots of goodness for anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi are fully known. If there are sentient beings whose roots of goodness have matured and who will encounter a buddha in the future, this too is fully known. Observing the past for inexpressible, inexpressible eons in this way, the mind is never wearied—this is the sixth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva enters the future and observes, discerning all eons—immeasurable and boundless—knowing which eons have buddhas and which do not, how many tathāgatas appear in each eon, the names of each tathāgata, the worlds they inhabit, the names of those worlds, the number of beings they liberate, and their lifespans. Observing in this way throughout the entire future, all is fully known without exhaustion, yet without weariness—this is the seventh ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva enters the present and contemplates, observing in each thought-moment all the immeasurable, inexpressible worlds of the ten directions. In each, buddhas have attained, are attaining, or will attain supreme enlightenment. They approach the bodhimaṇḍa, sit beneath the bodhi-tree on auspicious grass, subdue the demon armies, and attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Rising from there, they enter cities and ascend celestial palaces, expound the subtle Dharma, turn the great Dharma-wheel, display supernatural powers, and subdue beings. Finally, they entrust the Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, relinquish their lives, and enter parinirvāṇa. After entering parinirvāṇa, they compile the Dharma-store, ensuring its long abiding, and adorn stūpas with various offerings. They also see all beings in those worlds who encounter buddhas, hear the Dharma, receive and uphold it, recite and contemplate it, and develop wisdom. Observing in this way, they universally perceive the ten directions without error in the buddha-Dharma, entering the count of eons without weariness—this is the eighth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva, for inexpressible, inexpressible eons, in each eon, makes offerings and pays homage to inexpressible, inexpressible, immeasurable buddhas. Manifesting rebirth from one life to the next, they make offerings with all requisites surpassing the three realms, and also make offerings to bodhisattvas, voice-hearers, and all great assemblies. After each tathāgata enters parinirvāṇa, they make supreme offerings to the relics and widely practice generosity, fulfilling the needs of all beings and bodhisattvas. With inconceivable mind, non-seeking mind, ultimate mind, beneficent mind, and for inexpressible, inexpressible eons, they make offerings to the buddhas for the sake of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, benefit sentient beings, uphold the true Dharma, and expound it—this is the ninth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva, at a single buddha’s place, bodhisattva’s place, or dharma-teacher’s place, single-mindedly seeks the Dharma taught by bodhisattvas—learning, teaching, practicing, purifying, and the Dharma of total retention. Having obtained this Dharma, they receive, uphold, recite, and explain it without weariness, inspiring immeasurable beings to arouse the mind corresponding to omniscience in the buddha-Dharma, enter true reality, and attain non-retrogression in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. The bodhisattva, in this way, for inexpressible, inexpressible eons, is never wearied—this is the tenth ocean-like wisdom.\"\n\nBodhisattvas, mahāsattvas, these are the ten ocean-like wisdoms of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. If all bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they will attain the great wisdom-ocean of all buddhas’ supreme omniscience.”\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* states:\n“Wisdom is the root,\nGiving rise to the sprout of wholesome dharmas.\nThe great bodhi-fruit of the buddhas\nIs wrought by nothing but wisdom.”\n\nThus it is known that the wisdom of the buddhas is most transcendent and supreme. From the Song and Yuan dynasties onward, those immortals who realized the Dao—such as Sanfeng, Ziyang, and Miaozheng—all fully awakened to the One Mind, subtly accorded with true reality, and truly entered wisdom. They may be considered equal in measure to the patriarchs of the Chan school.\n\n81. **Abandoning the Most Difficult**\n\nThe *Compendium of Divine Immortals* records that the Dark Emperor perfected the Dao and ascended from the Flying Ascension Cliff on Mount Wudang, demonstrating to disciples the essential principle of abandoning the body. The venerable Laozi taught, “Put the body outside, place it behind”—this is the meaning of abandoning the body. Master Tan’s “forgetting form, forgetting qi, forgetting spirit” is also the practice of abandoning the body. Alas, how deeply worldly people cling to attachment! Even external wealth and possessions they are unwilling to relinquish—how much less this body? My late teacher lamented this and composed *The Three Teachings Unified*, teaching everywhere that one must abandon this corporeal form and nurture spirit, regulate breath, in the emptiness beyond the body.\n\nIn the *General Explanation of the Unified Teaching*, it is said:\n“The great Way of the Golden Elixir is entirely a matter of the emptiness beyond the body. If even the slightest thought clings to the post-heaven corporeal form, it is already off by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not be formed.”\n\nHe also once told me:\n“To speak of it in ultimate terms, saying it has no connection with this body is still superficial. The practice must be carried to the point where it has no relation whatsoever to mind, knowing, intention, or consciousness—only then is it true pre-heaven. Not only must the corporeal form be abandoned, but the mind and consciousness must also be relinquished. Only when one reaches the state of great samādhi and true samādhi, the realm of emptiness of both body and mind, does one accord with the profound meaning of ‘putting the body outside yet preserving it,’ and personally realize what is prior to the image of the Lord. One transcends the other shore of Sound-Before-Sound. When cultivation reaches this point, reversing aging and restoring youth becomes as easy as turning one’s palm.”\n\nMy late teacher, in replying to Meng Junhan on the meaning of abandoning the body, said:\n“These two words, ‘abandoning the body,’ are most crucial. Let me explain further. Disciples must first know that only by relinquishing the corporeal form can one cultivate the Dharma-body. The corporeal form, being formed, is inevitably subject to decay; the Dharma-body, being formless, is truly real. If one does not first abandon the post-heaven corporeal form, the pre-heaven Dharma-body cannot ascend. The scriptures say: When the heart dies, the spirit lives; when the consciousness-spirit is extinguished, the original spirit appears. *Laozi* says: ‘Place it behind, and it comes first; put it outside, and it is preserved.’ It also says: ‘Put it outside, and it is cultivated; forget the form, and the form is perfected.’ ‘My greatest worry is that I have a body; if I had no body, what worry would I have?’ Confucius said: ‘If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.’ Lüzu said: ‘To kill life after it is born, to learn death before one dies—this is long life.’ All these teach one to abandon the corporeal form and cultivate the Dharma-body. Bai Yuchan said: ‘A word or half a phrase can penetrate the mystery—what need is there for a thousand or ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures? If one is not burdened by form, the Great Brahmā Heaven is right before one’s eyes.’ In learning the Dao, the greatest fear is clinging to the corporeal form.\n\nLet me make this even clearer: In all practice, if one feels even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring within the body, one must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. This is the true oral instruction of the two words ‘abandoning the body.’ Thus, the True Lord of Emptiness and Stillness said: ‘Let him do as he will, let him act as he pleases, pay him no mind—he is he, how can he affect me?’ Ponder this deeply!\n\nThe ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all speak of guarding against danger. But what danger is there in learning the Dao? What is this danger? In practice, if one feels even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring within the body, and does not swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside, this is great danger. Over time, it will surely lead to serious illness. But if one knows to swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside, there is no danger. Even if there are one or two, three or four instances of leakage, it is of no concern. With long practice, the illness of seminal leakage will naturally disappear. This is the verified effect of my own past practice.”\n\nHe also said:\n“If wandering thoughts arise and vanish of their own accord, this is precisely the danger of not swiftly turning to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. From now on, whenever you practice, if you feel even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest wandering thought in the mind, you must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. If you feel even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring of internal qi within the body—whether it brings ease or joy—you must even more swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. If you feel even the slightest stirring, the faintest movement, or the briefest arousal of the yang organ, regardless of whether it is firm or soft, you must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. Practice this for three months, and body and mind will naturally become still and settled, qi and blood will naturally harmonize and flow smoothly, and leakage will naturally cease. The effects are truly swift—do not take this lightly!\n\nI endured over twenty years of hardship seeking the oral instructions of a teacher, and this is precisely the oral instruction I sought. I see that you cling to images, words, and the snares of the corporeal form—this is truly lamentable. Thus, I speak from the depths of my heart to tell you this.\n\nIn sum, the great Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, entirely takes the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside the body as its starting point and its conclusion. Thus, the ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all say it is most simple and most easy. If even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest thought clings to the corporeal form, it is no longer most simple and most easy.”\n\nAlas! Once you have seen and believed, when practicing the work, swiftly and urgently abandon the body.”\n\nMaster Jialingyin of the Qing Dynasty states in *Essentials of Sectarian Inspection*: “The effort of breaking through must involve doubt; after breaking through, the effort must be abandoned. If even the slightest perception, hearing, awareness, or knowledge—even wisdom and virtuous attributes—is not relinquished, nothing will be complete; if even the smallest thing is not abandoned, nothing will be perfect. The two layers of effort—doubt and abandonment—are such that doubt is easy, while abandonment is difficult.”\n\nThis is why the ancients devoted their entire lives to diligent practice, refusing to halt their transformation midway: they would not deceive their own hearts. Master Yuanyu Qin of the Song Dynasty said: “A true master of the school permits only the abandonment of knowledge and views, leaving not even a hair’s breadth in the mind. Empty and vast like the great void, nurtured and ripened over time—this is the original scenery, the original face.”\n\nHe also said: “In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, there is nothing that is not thoroughly penetrated, no separation in any phenomenon. This is called ‘pure as the bright dew,’ the singular clarity of one’s own mind. Yet one must not merely guard it, for guarding leads to stagnation. Instead, one must bravely sever and utterly abandon it. The more one abandons, the clearer one becomes; the farther one turns away, the nearer one draws. Only by resolutely dismantling, casting aside one’s very life, does one become a corpse devoid of breath—then, and only then, can one tread the path beyond. This is known only to oneself; even knowledge is not established. Śākyamuni, Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, Deshan, Linji—none dare gaze directly upon it. Is this not a wondrous matter?”\n\nThe insights of both Chan and Daoist adepts on the effort of abandonment are exceedingly subtle and meticulous. Generally, those who enter the Way must be able to abandon at all times, not merely during practice. Whenever one encounters attachments to worldly affairs or the arising of habitual tendencies and sensory desires, one must wield the Diamond King’s precious sword, fiercely severing all without leaving the slightest residue. The mind of clinging is the most difficult to cure; the most wondrous method of dealing with it is to separate it from the corporeal body and lodge it within the emptiness of space. Once it beholds the King of Emptiness, it can only surrender, powerless to develop further schemes.\n\nThus, the profound tradition of refining spirit in the void, harmonizing with the breath, and dissolving into formlessness, merging with the great emptiness, is truly the wondrous method for subduing the mind, the secret treasury of abandoning the body, the swift path to attaining truth, and the precious raft for transcending the mundane. From the ancient sages to the present, over four thousand years have passed, with transmission from master to master unbroken. For those of us who love the Way and encounter this teaching, how can we not rejoice and resolutely commit to cultivation?\n\n---\n\nSection Eighty-Two: *Utmost Stability*\n\nThe *Gengsang Chu* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: “To attain stillness, let the qi be balanced; to attain spirit, let the heart be at ease.” The *Dechong Fu* chapter says: “Balance is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model, for inwardly it is preserved while outwardly it remains undisturbed.” The *Keyi* chapter states: “Serene, tranquil, still, and empty—non-action—this is the balance of heaven and earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue. Thus, when the sage rests, he attains balance and ease; with balance and ease comes serenity. With balance, ease, and serenity, worries and afflictions cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot invade. Thus, his virtue is whole, and his spirit is not diminished.”\n\nMaster Lü said: “Without thought, one can attain stillness; in stillness, the qi naturally balances. When the qi is balanced, the breath comes to rest; when the breath rests, one naturally returns to truth.”\n\nIn the cultivation of the profound tradition, the initial effort is first to seek balance of the heart and balance of the breath—this “balance” is the image of stability. With prolonged balance, one enters true stability; in true stability, heart and breath are both still, wondrously harmonizing with the void.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “resting in the harmony of heaven” is balance, and it is also stability. The Buddhist “thusness, unmoving” is balance, and it is also stability. The supreme balance of the One of Heaven is nothing more than the stillness of flowing water. The mind-ground of the perfected one is without waves, the billows of consciousness entirely stilled—this is akin to it. Thus, the realm of wisdom is empty, and illumination is without omission.\n\nDoes not the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* say: “When body and mind are entirely equal, inner and outer are liberated”? The *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* also states: “Good man, just as space is thus equal and unmoving, know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving. Because the four great elements are unmoving, know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving. Thus, even the eighty-four thousand dhāraṇī gates are equal and unmoving—know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving.”\n\nThe commentary explains: When body and mind are as still as space, then the inner and outer senses and their objects are all liberated—this is the meaning of equality in the *Avataṃsaka*. Melting all dharmas into the one mind, equating the nature of enlightenment with space, with mind and realm thus and unmoving—this is the meaning of equality in the *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment*. Serene, tranquil, still, and empty—non-action—this is the wondrous balance of body and mind in the profound tradition. Undisturbed and unshaken, resting in the harmony of heaven—this is the verification of the thusness of mind and realm in the profound tradition.\n\nWhen the heart and breath in the profound tradition mutually rely upon each other to reach the state of oneness, then the inner and outer, body and mind, are all entirely equal and one. The nature is the true emptiness of form, and the emptiness is the true form of nature—is this not the swift path to liberation?\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, in the *Chapter on the Perfect Penetration of Earth-Holding Bodhisattva*, states: “At that time, I treated all buddhas equally. Vipaśyin Buddha placed his hand on my head and said, ‘When the mind-ground is balanced, then the world and the earth are all balanced.’ My mind then opened, and I saw the fine dust of my body and all the fine dust of the world of creation—all were equal and without difference. The self-nature of fine dust does not mutually abrade. The Buddha asked about perfect penetration, and I had already carefully observed that the two realms of dust are equal and without difference, fundamentally the treasury of the Thus-Come One. When delusion arises as dust, and the dust dissolves, wisdom is perfected, and the unsurpassed Way is accomplished. This is the foremost.”\n\nThis passage, through the balancing of the mind-ground, achieves the interpenetration of environment and wisdom, the equality of body and realm, and from this awakens to the Dao and attains fruition. The profound tradition proceeds from the equality of mind and breath to the equality of body and land, and from the non-duality of body and mind to the unimpeded union of emptiness and form—this too is the wondrous practice of balancing the mind-ground.\n\nSpeaking of the initial effort, the interdependence of mind and breath values attaining equilibrium. \"Equilibrium\" means the correspondence of two and eight—Master Huzi called it the \"balance of the qi mechanism.\" When balanced, there is harmony; when harmonious, there is stability. Master Sanfeng said: \"Concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath require only the mind to be balanced and the qi harmonious. When the mind is balanced, the spirit congeals; when the qi is harmonious, the breath is regulated. The character for 'balanced' is most wondrous: the mind without waves is called balanced, the mind abiding in the center is called balanced—this balance is precisely within this center. When the mind is in this center, it does not stir waves; this center is the *xuanguan* aperture of the alchemical classics.\"\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *On Regulating the Breath* states: \"What is 'not forgetting'? It is guarding the natural. What is 'not forcing'? It is following the natural. How to guard? By relying on the breath. How to follow? By balancing the breath. Relying on the breath allows the breath to connect with the breath; balancing the breath allows the breath to become even.\" Thus, the interdependence of mind and breath must be even and natural, only then is it called \"half a catty, eight taels\"—Ziyang’s \"two and eight correspond and naturally unite.\"\n\nFurthermore, at the moment yang arises in a single awareness, equilibrium is also valued. If awareness is too heavy, water prevails and fire is scant, and after ceasing practice, one feels an overflow of saliva; if awareness is too light, fire prevails and water is scant, and after ceasing practice, one feels a dry mouth and parched tongue. It must be neither heavy nor light—half a catty, eight taels—so that the fire phase naturally reaches the spirit’s awareness, and the spirit naturally departs the body, precisely attaining the proper measure, without excess or deficiency. This is what Master Sanfeng called \"the equal balance of firmness and softness,\" and also: \"The crow’s eight taels, the hare’s half catty—both enter the village of *wuji* together.\"\n\nThe cessation of the eighty-third [thought] is most wondrous. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Return and rest, my lord.\" And again: \"Rest in the evenness of heaven; rest and there is emptiness, emptiness and there is fullness, fullness and there is order.\" And again: \"Have we not spoken enough? Serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease.\" This is the essential principle of the profound tradition’s cessation of the mind.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"When the mad nature ceases of itself, cessation is bodhi.\" Master Baizhang said: \"First, cease all conditions, rest from all affairs. Whether good or evil, worldly or transcendent—all dharmas—do not recall or contemplate them. Release body and mind, let them be at ease. Let the mind be like wood or stone, without discrimination, without movement. When the mind-ground is empty, the sun of wisdom naturally appears, like the sun emerging when clouds disperse. Simply cease all clinging, greed, anger, love, and delusion; when the dust of defilement and purity is exhausted, remain unmoved by the five desires and eight winds. Unbound by perception, hearing, awareness, or knowledge, unconfused by any realm, one naturally possesses the wondrous functioning of spiritual penetrations—this is the liberated person.\"\n\nMaster Wushou said: \"It is only because greed and desire have become one’s nature that the twenty-five realms are tied to one’s heels, with no hope of accomplishment. The patriarchs transmitted only the mind-seal; those who attain it, whether ordinary or sagely, foolish or wise, immediately cease all conditions, suddenly rest from the ten thousand affairs, and transcend the stream of birth and death.\"\n\nMaster Deshan said: \"A single thought bound by the slightest attachment becomes the cause of the three evil destinies; a fleeting thought of passion becomes the fetter of ten thousand kalpas. One must, in the very place of one’s former conduct, suddenly cast off all bonds. When not a single thought arises, the continuity of the past is severed, and no dharma can touch the mind.\"\n\nMaster Xuansha said: \"Forget knowledge in serene illumination, empty and containing the ten thousand images. Release idle conditions, cease the mind’s consciousness—only then can one slightly approach intimacy. Otherwise, one is entirely carried away by the consciousness of discrimination, with no freedom at all.\"\n\nMaster Huangbo said: \"All sentient beings, ceaselessly revolving in birth and death, do so because the mind runs after conditions, not resting in the six paths, thus suffering all manner of afflictions.\"\n\n*Vimalakīrti* said: \"Those difficult to transform have minds like monkeys; therefore, with various methods, one must restrain and subdue the mind.\"\n\nMaster Furong said: \"If you do not cease now, when will you? If you can exhaust this moment, what further affairs remain?\"\n\nMaster Yuanwu said: \"Bodhisattvas practicing at home are like lotuses in fire. For titles, power, influence, and pride are most difficult to subdue. Moreover, in the burning house of worldly vexations, unless one directly awakens to the wondrous functioning of one’s original true nature, attains the great quiescent cessation, and can let go, becoming utterly ordinary and thoroughly realizing no-mind, one cannot succeed.\"\n\nThis is the wondrousness of the Chan school’s cessation of the mind.\n\nSince beginningless time, we have flowed through the six paths, enduring all hardships, only because we have not been able to thoroughly let go, thoroughly cease. If, in a single thought, cessation is sudden, the three times are all empty, the stream of birth and death is cut off—what further rebirth could there be? Therefore, in learning the Dao, one must first cease conditions, then cease thoughts, and cease the mind. \"Cessation\" means letting go of everything.\n\nThe profound tradition’s regulation of the breath, making the mind rely on the breath to gradually settle, is also a skillful method for ceasing the mind. When one reaches the point where breath and thought are both extinguished, and great stability is naturally attained, then all existences are empty, and inner and outer are entirely forgotten. When stability reaches its limit and transforms, the Dharma-body manifests and functions freely, like a silkworm’s cocoon transforming into a flying moth.\n\nThus, Confucius said: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\"\n\nMencius said: \"Nurturing life is insufficient for great matters; only in sending off the dead can great matters be settled.\" This all teaches one to learn death before dying. When arising and ceasing are both extinguished, quiescent extinction appears before one, arriving at the realm of great rest and great cessation.\n\n*Zhuangzi* states: \"Have you ever wandered in the Palace of Nothingness? Together we merge and discourse—is there any end to it?\" It also says: \"Forget your liver and gall, abandon your ears and eyes, wander in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam carefree in the work of no-affairs.\" And again: \"Cast off your form, expel your intelligence, forget all relations and things, and merge into the vast primordial. Release the heart, liberate the spirit, and become utterly devoid of soul.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: \"Separate from qi and absorb the constructive and defensive; the north (Kan) no longer employs hearing; the west (Dui) unites without speech. Rare words accord with the primal chaos. When these three are mastered, relax the body and dwell in an empty chamber. Entrust your will to the Void, making non-thought your constant state.\" This is precisely the wondrous practice of the profound tradition’s return to quiescence—where heart and breath wondrously merge with emptiness, allowing self-stabilization and self-transformation. Concealing brilliance and erasing radiance, undergoing a great death, only then does cold ash burst into flame, withered wood bloom anew. Nature is preserved, life is restored, and transcendence becomes possible.\n\n*The Liezi·Heaven’s Blessings* records: \"Zigong, weary of study, told Confucius: ‘I wish to rest.’ Confucius replied: ‘In life, there is no rest.’ Zigong asked: ‘Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?’ Confucius said: ‘You shall. Look upon that grave mound—its enclosure, its mound, its tomb, its vessel—then you will know where rest lies.’ Zigong exclaimed: ‘How great is death! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low there.’\" This too is the subtle teaching of the sages’ return to quiescence.\n\nTo find death within life, to let go at the precipice—arriving at the realm of great rest and great cessation, vast and level, the void shattered to dust. Lü Zu said: \"To kill life after it has arisen, to learn death before dying—this is longevity.\" The secret formula states: The emptiness beyond the body is our resting place, the vessel-like grave mound the sacred ground of quiescence. Roam carefree within it, until inner and outer are entirely forgotten, roots and realms both dissolved. Body and heart become utterly empty and unmoving, naturally returning to the root like fallen leaves, wondrously uniting with the Dao of true constancy.\n\nThe four characters—stabilization, forgetting, relinquishing, cessation—are the secret formulas of Daoist cultivation, the swift path to transcendence. Just as the saying goes: \"Trampled iron shoes in vain search, yet it comes without effort.\"\n\n---\n\nSection 84: *Heaven’s Work*\nThe ancient sages illuminated the \"infant’s conduct,\" while Zhuangzi revealed \"Heaven’s work.\" The infant’s conduct takes harmonious softness and pure sincerity without falsehood as its essence, demonstrating the uncarved simplicity of primal chaos—the sages’ teaching of returning to simplicity and restoring purity.\n\nHeaven’s work takes utmost emptiness and wondrous clarity as its foundation, returning the spirit to the beginningless, merging with the Great Unity, and becoming one with the Great Void—this is the wondrous Dao of returning to emptiness.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"One who is not clear about Heaven is not pure in virtue\"; \"Those who harmonize with Heaven are called Heaven’s joy. Those who know Heaven’s joy—while alive, their conduct is Heaven’s work; in death, they transform with things. At rest, they share virtue with yin; in motion, they move with the waves of yang\"; \"When arranged and departed, transformation enters the vast oneness of Heaven\"; \"Forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. Those who forget the self are said to enter Heaven\"; \"When schemes and plans are unused, one must return to Heaven\"; \"If the heart does not wander in Heaven, the six senses will clash\"; \"Emptiness and tranquility alone accord with Heaven’s virtue\"; \"Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, tranquil and non-active, moving as Heaven works—this is the Dao of nurturing the spirit.\"\n\n\"In the Dao of pure simplicity, only the spirit guards itself. Guard it without loss, and unite with the spirit. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heaven’s order\"; \"Heaven’s virtue emerges in tranquility, not departing from its origin—this is called the Heavenly person. When form and essence are not diminished, this is called the power to transform. Essence refined to the utmost returns to assist Heaven\"; \"Following this or that, following that or this—the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates with Heaven\"; \"Beginning and end are like a ring, with no discernible order—this is called Heaven’s balance. Heaven’s balance is Heaven’s boundary\"; \"Those who revere without joy, are insulted without anger—only those who harmonize with Heaven’s harmony are so. Who knows the eloquence of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? If one can know this, it is called Heaven’s treasury. Pour into it without filling, draw from it without exhausting, yet not knowing its source—this is called preserving brilliance\"; \"I am about to join the Creator as a companion. When weary, I ride the bird of boundless qi, emerging beyond the six directions to wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness of great emptiness\"; \"They are about to join the Creator as companions, roaming in the one qi of Heaven and Earth\"; \"Entering and exiting without revealing its form—this is called Heaven’s gate. Heaven’s gate is Nothingness. Yet in Nothingness, there is no Nothingness—this is where the sage conceals himself.\"\n\nThe above passages from *Zhuangzi* repeatedly expound the wondrousness of Heaven’s work. For the heart wanders in tranquility, qi merges with vastness, vast and empty as the Great Void, utterly without trace. Without moment or occasion, it transcends beyond the ten thousand existences, wondrously uniting with the image of the Lord before its manifestation. Still and luminous, quiescent and radiant, empty and natural—this is what is called Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* speaks of \"illuminating vastness\" (昭旷), \"primordial obscurity\" (混溟), \"mysterious darkness\" (玄冥), \"boundless emptiness\" (参寥), \"Heaven’s gate\" (天门), \"Heaven’s balance\" (天均), \"Heaven’s order\" (天伦), \"Heaven’s treasury\" (天府), \"Heaven’s harmony\" (天和), \"Heaven’s joy\" (天乐), \"Heaven’s virtue\" (天德), and \"Heaven’s oneness\" (天一)—all are the purport of Heaven’s work. Its wondrousness lies in returning to oneness without trace, pervading all things without intent.\n\nThe *Buddha-Curve Sutra* calls Heaven’s work the \"royal samādhi of the Middle Way.\" When the mechanism of entering the Middle arises, Heaven’s work responds with compassion, like a donkey or horse seeing the shadow of a whip—proceeding along the great straight path, without before or after, neither merging nor separating. It teaches the Dharma of no-discrimination, for all dharmas from the very beginning bear the mark of constant quiescent extinction.\n\nI say that Heaven’s work is the practice of the vast and mysterious Dao, wondrously uniting with spontaneity. As Dongshan said: *\"One must ensure that the mind never touches things, step by step without fixed abode, ever unbroken—only then does one attain accord.\"* This is the meaning of Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"The Great Oneness flows through it\"* and *\"The Great Stillness holds it.\"* This precisely reveals the ultimate aim of Heaven’s work. For the Great Oneness is Heavenly nature, the Dharma-realm—it is the fundamental principle that does not depart from its source. When the mind flows through the One, this is called \"illuminating the source.\" After illuminating the source, one again *\"holds it with the Great Stillness.\"* With the purity of awakening and cultivation, the original substance is empty and vast, transcending the ten thousand images. Pervading all things without attachment, acting without intent—like the sun shining and the wind turning—only then does one accord with the wondrous Dao of Heaven’s work.\n\nGuan Yinzi said: *\"He dwells in the measure of no-excess, conceals himself in the beginningless thread, roams the beginning and end of the ten thousand things, unifies his nature, nurtures his qi, harmonizes his virtue, and thereby communicates with the source of all things.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Alone he wanders with the spirit of Heaven and Earth, without arrogance toward the ten thousand things. Above, he roams with the Creator; below, he befriends those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In responding to and dissolving things, his principle is inexhaustible, his coming untainted. Vague and obscure—who can fathom its depths?\"* And again: *\"The spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit. Above, it observes Heaven; below, it coils upon the Earth. Transforming and nurturing the ten thousand things, it cannot be represented in image—its name is ‘coalescing with the Lord.’\"* This is the ultimate attainment of Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Book of Changes* says: *\"The ‘Adornment’ hexagram is without color. The ‘Following’ hexagram is without cause.\"* And again: *\"What does the world have to think or worry about? The world converges through different paths, unites through a hundred deliberations—what does the world have to think or worry about?\"* To awaken to the true emptiness of form and color, to wondrously unite with the source of the Dao, to synthesize the ten thousand transformations, to encompass Heaven and Earth—this is the Heaven’s work of the Sage Confucius.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place says: *\"The flying dragon is in Heaven—auspicious to see the great person\"* (the \"great person\" refers to the Dharma-body). The *Great Accumulation* hexagram’s top line says: *\"What thoroughfare of Heaven! Free and unobstructed!\"* (These line statements were composed by the Duke of Zhou, signifying the breakthrough of accumulated fullness, the image of boundless openness. *\"What thoroughfare of Heaven!\"* means: *How could it be so thoroughly open?*) This is the Duke of Zhou’s Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: *\"The Mandate of Heaven—solemn and unceasing! Oh, how resplendent!\"* The purity of King Wen’s virtue—this is King Wen’s Heaven’s work.\n\n*\"Fasting of the mind, sitting in forgetfulness, departing from form, abandoning knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare\"*—this is Yanzi’s Heaven’s work.\n\n*\"Utmost sincerity without ceasing, vast and deep, lofty and bright, enduring and boundless—even without display it is manifest, without movement it transforms, without action it accomplishes\"*—this is Zisi’s Heaven’s work.\n\nNature opens to Heaven’s clarity, the body unites with true emptiness. Caoshan said: *\"Harmoniously merged, without inside or outside, level and even above and below.\"* Dongshan said: *\"Harmoniously merged without concealment—what more could one seek?\"* This is the Heaven’s work of the Chan school.\n\nOne must also understand that the \"Heaven\" in Heaven’s work is not the Heaven opposed to Earth, but the fundamental principle of the vast and mysterious Dao—the Heaven of Nirvāṇa, the Heaven of the First Principle. The *Baojing Sanmei of the Dongzong* says: *\"Heavenly truth is wondrous, neither deluded nor awakened.\"* This wondrous Dao of Heavenly truth gives rise to the wondrous practice of non-action—this is called Heaven’s work.\n\n---\n\nThe *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* sets forth five kinds of practice: first, the *sacred practice* (聖行); second, the *pure practice* (梵行); third, *Heaven’s work* (天行); fourth, the *infant practice* (嬰兒行); and fifth, the *sick practice* (病行). The *Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sūtra* takes the sacred practice as the samādhi of the real truth, the pure practice, infant practice, and sick practice as the samādhi of the conventional truth, and Heaven’s work as the royal samādhi of the Middle Way.\n\nThe *Book of Laozi* elaborates in great detail on the infant practice, while the inner and outer chapters of the *Zhuangzi* explicate Heaven’s work and the sacred practice with great precision. The so-called sacred practice is the practice of entering sageliness—still yet luminous, quiescent yet radiant, vast and impartial. As things come, it responds in accord. Its practice leaves no tracks, its virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth. It exhausts nature to reach destiny, fathoms the spirit to penetrate transformation—from this arises the learning of inner sageliness and outer kingship.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is good, and so he is still. Rather, nothing in the ten thousand things can disturb his mind, and so he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and eyebrows, its levelness serves as a standard—even great craftsmen take it as their model. If still water is so clear, how much more the spirit! The mind of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking glass of the ten thousand things. That emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the level of Heaven and Earth and the ultimate of the Dao and virtue—thus the emperors, kings, and sages rest in them.\"* This shows that the sacred practice takes emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action as its fundamental principle.\n\nOnly through emptiness can one achieve penetration; only through stillness can one attain clarity; only through quiescence can one respond; only through blandness can one remain unstained—these are the essential principles of recovering one’s original nature and the standards for entering sagehood.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further states: *\"In going out and coming in, one does not perceive its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. That Non-Being is the Non-Being of no Non-Being—it is where the sage abides.\"* This reveals the sage’s realm where both emptiness and existence are transcended, perfectly aligning with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s state of *\"liberation from dharmas, where both are empty and nothing arises.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"One who takes Heaven as their teacher yet fails to truly follow Heaven perishes along with things—how can this be considered the mean? The sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with humanity, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things. They move with the world without decline, their actions complete yet unconfined—how could they be forced into conformity?\"* This means the sage precedes Heaven yet does not oppose it, not merely following Heaven’s timing afterward. Their mind transcends the state before Heaven and Earth arose, yet they still accord with sentient beings, walking and acting together, transforming and benefiting them with boundless compassion—far from the self-liberated Hīnayāna practitioners who enter the extinction of *nirodha-samāpatti* as their ultimate goal.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further declares: *\"The sage dwells like a nesting dove and eats like a fledgling bird, moving like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Dao, they flourish with all things; when the world loses the Dao, they cultivate virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, they depart as an immortal, riding white clouds to the celestial realm. The three calamities never reach them, and their body remains free from harm.\"* This shows the sage’s appearance and concealment are unfixed, their dwelling without constancy. They adapt to circumstances, neither resisting nor seeking, free from honor and disgrace. In adversity, they perfect themselves; in prosperity, they benefit the world. When the fruit of the Dao ripens, they transcend and depart—such is their freedom and ease. This is why the ancients abandoned worldly rank to cultivate celestial nobility.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"Those who do not strive for loftiness, who cultivate without relying on benevolence and righteousness, who govern without fame, who find leisure without retreating to rivers and seas, who attain longevity without guiding practices—nothing is not forgotten, yet nothing is not possessed. Serene and boundless, all excellence gathers to them. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\"* This reveals the sage’s wondrous forgetfulness and virtue of non-action, which those whose minds remain attached cannot hope to attain.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further states: *\"Affirming this because of that, affirming that because of this—the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates with Heaven. Thus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance—this is called the sage’s conduct.\"* This means the sage does not cling to the duality of right and wrong but illuminates with wondrous clarity, forgetting both emotions and circumstances, transcending self and others. In responding to situations, whether so or not-so, they adapt freely, bestowing or withholding as needed, killing or enlivening at will. Thus, they employ right and wrong to quell others’ disputes, using poison to counteract poison, a wedge to remove a wedge—this is the great function of dissolving attachments and breaking bonds.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"Taking Heaven as their standard, virtue as their root, the Dao as their gate, and foreseeing transformations—this is called the sage.\"* Thus, the sage comprehends the virtue of Heaven and profoundly unites with the pivot of the Dao, abiding in its center to respond endlessly, their transformations unfathomable—all arising from their realization of the fundamental and illumination of the mind.\n\nIt further states: *\"When the mind is settled, the ten thousand things submit. Speaking of emptiness and stillness extending to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the ten thousand things—this is called celestial joy. Celestial joy is the sage’s mind nurturing the world.\"* This shows the sage’s governance of the world, taking emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action as their foundation, allowing each to return to their true mind and merge with the great transformation, free and unobstructed. This is what is meant by *\"governing through non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*’s *\"Chapter on the Sage’s Conduct\"* begins with upholding the precepts, abiding in the unshakable ground, then clarifies the Four Noble Truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path, cultivating precepts, concentration, and wisdom, ultimately revealing the eternal, blissful, true self, and purity. Progressing through the sage’s conduct taught in the *Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, one advances to the ground of fearlessness, attains the twenty-five samādhis, destroys the twenty-five realms of existence, and manifests various supernatural powers. Further, one abides in self-mastery, freely taking birth and accomplishing immeasurable, boundless merits.\n\nThe *Sūtra* further states: *\"Good son, what is called the sage’s conduct? It is the conduct practiced by the Buddha and bodhisattvas—hence it is called the sage’s conduct. Why are the Buddha and bodhisattvas called sages? Such beings possess all dharmas; they constantly contemplate the empty and quiescent nature of the sacred dharma—therefore they are called sages. They possess the sacred precepts—therefore they are called sages. They possess the sacred concentration and wisdom—therefore they are called sages. They possess the seven sacred treasures—faith, precepts, shame, remorse, learning, wisdom, and renunciation—therefore they are called sages. They possess the seven factors of enlightenment—therefore they are called sages. For these reasons, it is also called the sage’s conduct.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* expounds the *\"sage’s conduct,\"* while the *Liezi*’s *\"Confucius\"* chapter expounds *\"sage wisdom.\"* As the sage’s conduct is rooted in emptiness and stillness, attaining the six supernatural powers and the fourfold liberation, they achieve unobstructed perfection—thus sage wisdom manifests. This is truly the inner realization of the Daoist school, which, when compared with the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra*’s *\"self-realized sage wisdom,\"* is entirely congruent.\n\nThe above discussion of the celestial and sage’s conducts synthesizes the profound principles of the Daoist school and Buddhism. As for practice, it all converges in the single act of *\"mind and breath depending on each other,\"* which encompasses everything. Through one practice, all is practiced; through one realization, all is realized. Thus, if a practitioner truly attains the great concentration of true emptiness, both the celestial and sage’s conducts are fully contained therein.\n\n86. **Brahmacarya**\nBrahmacarya is the practice of purity (note: Ge Hong’s *Character Models and Teachings* defines *brahma* as pure conduct). The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* contains a chapter titled “Brahmacarya,” while the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* divides “Brahmacarya” and “Pure Conduct” into two separate chapters. “Pure Conduct” pertains to the Ten Faiths stage, and “Brahmacarya” to the Ten Abodes stage.\n\nHere, following the Daoist school’s doctrine:\nThe “purity and desirelessness” of the Daoist sages constitutes the essence of brahmacarya. “Desirelessness” means the absence of craving. When body and mind are pure, the six senses undisturbed, desire naturally ceases. Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* states: “The human spirit favors clarity, yet the mind disturbs it; the human mind favors stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the mind becomes still; when the mind is settled, the spirit becomes clear, and naturally the six desires do not arise, the three poisons dissolve. The reason one cannot achieve this is that the mind is not settled and desires are not dispelled. Those who can dispel them inwardly observe the mind, yet find no mind; outwardly observe the form, yet find no form; distantly observe things, yet find no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen; observing emptiness, even emptiness is empty—emptiness has no emptiness, and what is emptied has no existence; when even ‘no emptiness’ is gone, profound stillness remains. Stillness has no stillness, so how can desire arise? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness. Truly responding to things, truly attaining nature, constantly responding, constantly still—this is constant purity and stillness.”\n\nThe Daoist sages say: “Purity and stillness are the norm of the world.” They also say: “Constantly without desire, one may be called small; I am without desire, and the people naturally return to simplicity. The nameless simplicity will also be without desire; without desire and still, the world will right itself.” Thus, the Daoist sages not only dispel worldly desires but also relinquish attachment to all dharmas. Detached from both emptiness and existence, forgetting both the mundane and the sacred—is this not the ultimate brahmacarya?\n\n87. **Refining the Self and Laying the Foundation**\nThe initial stage of Daoist cultivation is called “refining the self and laying the foundation,” its meaning derived from the Laozi’s “empty the mind, fill the belly.” “Refining the self” is the first step in returning to emptiness. When the six senses are profoundly settled and the mind does not wander, the body and mind become utterly empty, thereby attracting primordial true yang. This nurtures one’s life-root, irrigates one’s spiritual root, and daily replenishes one’s true qi. The elixir furnace grows warm, its light penetrating the curtains—is this not the effect of refining the self and laying the foundation?\n\n“Refining the self” means emptying the mind; “laying the foundation” means filling the belly. The more empty and still the body and mind, the more abundant the arrival of true yang. This mutual resonance of emptiness and fullness, their interpenetration, is a subtle principle with swift effects. The Laozi states: “Carrying your *po* and embracing the One, can you never depart from it? Concentrating your qi to attain suppleness, can you be like a newborn babe?” This precisely describes this stage of practice.\n\nIn the end, it is nothing more than placing everything externally, mind and breath depending on each other. Once great concentration is attained, refining the self and laying the foundation are both accomplished therein. The late master often said: “Emptying the mind is cultivating concentration in the Palace of Departure; filling the belly is seeking the mystery in the Water Mansion. Emptying the mind and filling the belly—this is the dual cultivation of nature and life, refining the self and laying the foundation.” He also said: “When the mind is empty, the spirit settles; when the spirit settles, qi naturally returns. Thus, to fill the belly, one must first empty the mind. Mind and breath depending on each other, placing everything externally—this is how the mind is emptied.” He further cited Master Sanfeng’s *A Sprig of Flowers*:\n“I am a touchstone, revealing high and low at once;\nI am an iron steamed bun, hard to bite into;\nI am a sea of purity, unstained by a speck of dust;\nI am a luminous pearl, suspended in the void.”\n\nHe stated: “These four lines should serve as the standard for refining the self.” The work of laying the foundation begins with the softening of the entire body and continues until, in deep concentration, not even the slightest arousal of yang occurs; when qi is sufficient, the fire is withdrawn, and the foundation of the elixir is thus established. However, refining the self must proceed until the final return to emptiness before it becomes truly serviceable. From the initial return to emptiness to the final return to emptiness, all that lies between belongs to the work of refining the self. Hence it is said: “Laying the foundation has its limits, but refining the self is boundless.”\n\nI maintain that all delusions—whether coarse or subtle, from the *kleśas* of the senses to the *avidyā* of ignorance—must be thoroughly purged before one can claim the great accomplishment of refining the self. If even the slightest trace of subtle ignorance remains unsevered, the refinement of the self is still impure. The true crucible for refining the self is the great samādhi of true emptiness.\n\n**88. Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self (I)**\nThe self is the mind. Nurturing the self is preserving the mind and cultivating one’s nature; refining the self is disciplining the mind and tempering one’s nature. Though the work is the same, nurturing the self resembles planting flowers and tending trees, growing day by day, while refining the self is like forging gold with fire, becoming ever purer—their meanings are not without distinction.\n\nMaster Qianxu said: “Between nurturing and refining, one must still make distinctions.” Master Shangyang said: “Treasure essence and enrich qi—this is nurturing the self; facing circumstances without attachment—this is refining the self. Nurturing the self emphasizes stillness, while refining the self encompasses activity.”\n\nThus, to remain unstained by even a speck of dust, to empty all myriad thoughts, to abide in constant stillness while constantly responding, to dwell in activity yet remain ever tranquil—this is the work of refining the self. To be full of qi and whole in spirit, to restore and accumulate early—this is the effect of nurturing the self. If one unites and penetrates these, the work ultimately lies nowhere but in the interdependence of mind and breath. When this interdependence reaches great samādhi, nurturing the self resides here, and refining the self also resides here.\n\nSomeone asked: “Using samādhi to nurture the self aligns with the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s saying, ‘Internally to nurture the self, abide in tranquil emptiness’—its meaning is easily understood. But to say that samādhi refines the self seems contrary to Master Qianxu’s principle of refining the self as encompassing activity. Could you further elucidate this?”\n\nHe replied: “At the moment when spirit and breath are both settled, both inner and outer are empty. Because of this inner and outer emptiness and stillness, the primordial true yang is drawn to my body. The true qi steams and permeates the *ying* and *wei*, just as plants receive sweet dew, making my body and mind daily stronger—this is what is meant by nurturing the self. Yet though I am empty and still, when the primordial true yang arrives at my body, my entire being becomes soft and numb, undergoing various transformations of the *se*-skandha, while I remain unmoved and serene, as if unaware—responding yet still, like fire forging gold, the gold does not change color but grows ever more refined and luminous. Is this not refining the self?\n\nFurthermore, because of great samādhi, the *vijñāna*-spirit gradually submits, the original spirit gradually manifests, habitual tendencies gradually dissolve, and worldly toils gradually cease. What the ancients called ‘the heart dies and the spirit lives’—is this not the meaning of refining the self? Though Master Qianxu spoke of refining the self as encompassing activity, the essence of refining the self truly lies in activity without activity. For stillness reaches its extreme and gives rise to movement—this movement is the movement of qi. When qi moves, the spirit immediately awakens. If this awakening drifts outward, spirit and qi separate, and the primordial instantly transforms into the acquired. If the awakening does not drift outward but remains settled externally, spirit and qi do not separate, and they are sent back to the earthen cauldron to be firmly sealed. Thus, both nurturing and refining the self ultimately hinge on a single word: *samādhi*. Samādhi is the non-duality of stillness and response—the Dao of the elixir begins and ends with it. As the *Book of Changes* says: ‘That which begins the myriad things and ends the myriad things—nothing is more flourishing than *gèn*.’ *Gèn* is stillness and cessation of movement—this is samādhi.”\n\nSomeone asked: “Then do nurturing the self and refining the self have a sequence? Is there an intention that they mutually support one another?”\n\nHe replied: “Nurturing the self and refining the self indeed rely on each other. Though there is no inherent sequence, it is not incorrect to speak of one. Why? The essence of nurturing the self depends on the cultivation of primordial true yang, so that my original qi grows daily more abundant and my original spirit daily more flourishing. Yet for every portion of primordial true yang that enters, a portion of acquired yin qi is dissolved. As yin qi is dissolved, deluded thoughts and desires diminish accordingly. For these desires are entirely the mischief of yin qi. Thus, the more abundant the true yang, the purer the mind. The deeper the work progresses, the more habitual tendencies and discriminating views are transformed, the fewer deluded thoughts arise, until one faces circumstances with suchness, unstained by even a speck of dust, all myriad thoughts emptied—all this is caused by the primordial true yang dissolving the delusions of the mind. That refining the self draws upon nurturing the self is abundantly clear.\n\nMoreover, as delusions daily dissolve and monthly transform, the central earth of the self grows ever stiller, body and mind ever more tranquil, and the power of samādhi ever increases. The primordial true yang from without is increasingly drawn in, until qi is sufficient and the fire is withdrawn—the returning elixir is formed. That nurturing the self supports refining the self is also beyond doubt.”\n\nThus, refining and nurturing mutually support one another. Though the ancients spoke of \"nurturing in stillness\" and \"refining in activity,\" this was framed in terms of the opposition between movement and quiescence. When movement and quiescence merge as one, stillness is ever-responsive, and responsiveness is ever-still—refining is nurturing, and the work proceeds as a single, unbroken practice. There is nothing to divide, nor any need to divide, hence the saying: \"It does not depart from the single word *quiescence*.\"\n\n**89. Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self (II)**\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir was called \"learning the undifferentiated\" in ancient times. The Old Sage spoke of \"guarding the center and embracing the One,\" while Zhuangzi simply said \"guarding the One and abiding in harmony.\" There was no mention of nurturing the self or refining the self. During the Western Han, Master Cui Xifan’s *Mirror for Entering the Medicine* comprised eighty-two verses in two hundred forty-six characters, encompassing the entire Dao of the Elixir without once referring to nurturing or refining the self.\n\nOne may ask: \"When, then, did such terms arise?\"\nThe answer: \"In the Eastern Han, Master Wei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: *'Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in tranquil emptiness. The root is hidden yet luminous, inwardly illuminating the body.'* This is the origin of the term *nurturing the self*. The term *refining the self* first appears in texts after the Tang and Song dynasties. The Pure Yang Realized One’s *Lyrics to the Melody ‘Spring in Qin Garden’* says: *'The sevenfold-returned elixir requires one first to refine the self and await the time.'* Master Sanfeng’s *Lyrics to the Melody ‘A Sprig of Flowers’* says: *'Moment by moment, rein in the horse of the mind; instant by instant, refine the monkey of the heart. Day and night without rest, the work of refining the self is unceasing.'* By the Ming dynasty, Master Qianxu’s *Rectifying the Golden Elixir* provided precise instructions on refining the self.\"\n\nI say: The Dao of the Elixir is fundamentally simple. For one who attains the samādhi of heart and breath interdependently harmonized, nurturing the self with true water and refining the self with true fire leaves nothing unaddressed. True water is the water of true emptiness of nature, the true emptiness of the water of nature. True fire is the fire of true emptiness of nature, the true emptiness of the fire of nature. When the work reaches true stillness and true emptiness, refining and nurturing are both subsumed, the wondrous aperture and mystery merge as one, and all is unified.\n\n**90. Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger**\nThe *Triplex Unity* states:\n*\"The crescent moon forms the furnace and crucible,\nthe White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury, the sun, becomes flowing pearls,\nthe Green Dragon accompanies it.\nRaise the east to meet the west,\nand the hun and po naturally bind one another.\"*\nElsewhere it says:\n*\"The Dragon calls to the Tiger,\nthe Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.\nThe two consume one another,\nboth covetously merging.\"*\nThough the phrasing is plain, its implications run deep.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"The White Tiger of the western mountains rages wildly,\nthe Green Dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and force them to fight to the death,\nand they transform into a lump of purple gold frost.\"*\n\nThe *Four Hundred Character Inscription on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The Dragon comes from the eastern sea,\nthe Tiger rises from the western mountains.\nThe two beasts battle fiercely,\ntransforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nAnother verse, *Song for Master Liu the Daoist*, says:\n*\"When the season arrives, employ the matchmaker.\nThe Metal Elder and the Maiden of Mercury wed.\nThe Metal Elder prefers to ride the White Tiger,\nthe Maiden of Mercury ever mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form.\nThe Tiger comes to rest in the autumn mountains,\nthe Dragon stirs from the azure depths.\nThe two beasts meet and battle fiercely,\nwaves surging and seething like a boiling cauldron.\nThe Yellow Dame and Ding the Elder lend their might,\nshaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.\nIn an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,\nand a mysterious pearl is planted in the mud below.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Stone Bridge* says:\n*\"I dwell within the mountains, truly boasting much,\nwhere flowers that never wither grow everywhere.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave conceals a fierce tiger,\nemerging to roar, wind and rosy clouds arise.\nSouth of the mountain, a deep pool hides a scaly dragon,\nascending in clouds, descending in rain, the mountain shrouded in mist.\nWhen the two beasts meet and battle,\nthe hidden pearl is the true omen of the mysterious.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang vividly depicts the battle of Dragon and Tiger, evoking awe and dread. I once raised this with my teacher, Wang, who said: \"When heart and breath depend on one another, the Dragon is naturally subdued. What else remains unresolved? Do not cling to words or fixate on phrases.\"\n\nLu Qianxu remarked: \"It is only because of the phrase *'the two tigers fight'* that misguided and heterodox schools have proliferated.\" Thus, in his *Exegesis on the Four Hundred Characters*, he writes:\n*\"Kan-lead is hard to obtain yet easily devours people, hence symbolized by the Tiger. Li-mercury is prone to flight and difficult to control, hence symbolized by the Dragon. The Dragon comes from the eastern sea, coming to join the Tiger. The Tiger rises from the western mountains, rising to follow the Dragon. The elixir method drives the Dragon to join the Tiger, guides the Tiger to follow the Dragon, causing the two beasts to devour and consume one another, battling within the palace of wu and ji. When they merge and harmonize, they transform into the marrow of heaven and earth, and the returning elixir may be accomplished.\"*\n\nXuanjing said: \"Subduing the Dragon means restraining the mind’s incessant delusion. Thoughts arise ceaselessly, galloping without pause, emerging and vanishing unpredictably, their origin unknown—hence likened to a Dragon. Taming the Tiger means mastering the breath’s ingress and egress. The breath is as difficult to regulate and tame as a Tiger. Thus, subduing the Dragon is subduing the mind, and taming the Tiger is taming the qi. The wonder lies in the interdependence of heart and breath beyond the body. When the heart depends on the breath, it congeals; when the breath depends on the heart, it flows smoothly. Gradually they harmonize, growing ever finer and subtler, until they stand immovably still—thoughts arise and cease no more, the breath enters and exits no more. Then the efficacy of subduing the Dragon and taming the Tiger is manifest.\"\n\nThis is the foundational work of the Mysterious School. Furthermore, at the moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, when the primordial true qi arrives, the entire body feels a melting, tingling sensation. If one stirs even the slightest thought at this juncture, the primordial instantly reverts to the postnatal, causing harm rather than benefit.\n\nThus, at the very instant the melting, tingling sensation arises, swiftly depart from the physical form and turn toward the interdependence of heart and breath beyond the body. Persist in this until settling into samādhi, whereupon true yin and true yang naturally fuse, returning to the earthen cauldron to be firmly sealed. This primordial true qi is also likened to the Tiger; when subdued through great samādhi, it congeals into the Elixir, no longer scattering outward.\n\nThe primordial true yang most effectively purges the delusions of the mind-ground, rendering one’s nature quiescent and emotions empty. With the heart stabilized and breath subdued, one remains unperturbed by phenomena, no longer drifting into distraction—this is the mastery of spirit through qi, what the alchemical texts call \"true Lead restraining true Mercury.\"\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Treading on the Tiger’s tail, it does not bite the person—propitious.\"* This is the image of taming the Tiger. It further says: *\"Using the Nine, one sees a host of Dragons without a leader—auspicious.\"* This is the image of subduing the Dragon.\n\nThus, the interdependence of heart and breath is the starting point of subduing Dragon and Tiger; great samādhi and true emptiness are its gradual stages. When the celestial nature unfolds in clarity and Dragon and Tiger leave no trace, this is the ultimate fruition of their subjugation.\n\n**Verse:**\n*(Adapted from the gāthās of Chan Master Puming and others, replacing \"ox\" and \"man\" with \"Dragon\" and \"Tiger,\" for the Chan metaphor of herding the ox shares the same purport as the Daoist subjugation of Dragon and Tiger.)*\n\nDragon and Tiger vanish without a trace,\nBright moon’s light embraces the ten thousand forms.\nShould you ask the true meaning therein—\nWildflowers and fragrant grasses grow in profusion.\n\nNo shadow of Dragon, no track of Tiger,\nWhy carve steps into the vast emptiness?\nIn the end, nothing whatsoever remains,\nYet the ten thousand forms naturally abound.\n\nSeeking their radiance in vain,\nNo Dragon, no Tiger—mist and water dissolve into space.\nAs the great earth awakens from spring’s dream,\nThe sun climbs high, incense scatters, flowers bloom in clusters.\n\nNo trace of Dragon or Tiger to be found,\nLike the pure moon pervading empty space.\nWhy inquire further into its meaning?\nBirds sing of themselves, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nA life built on the tip of a snail’s horn,\nFrom the outset, they share a single home.\nHow laughable that ancients left this image—\nThirty feet of wisteria vine leave no room for delay.\n\n---\n\n**91. Refining and Withdrawing-Adding**\n\nWhat is meant by \"civil refinement and martial tempering\"? In a word, it is the state where spirit and qi harmoniously merge, and body and mind remain unmoving.\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* states: *\"Someone asked, ‘What is refining?’ I replied: ‘At the moment when body and mind are about to unite yet remain ununited, if even the slightest stray thought intrudes, confront it with resolute determination—this is martial tempering. After body and mind have united and spirit and qi have merged, guard it with a gentle, harmonious heart—this is civil refinement.’\"* There is no other principle here; simply subduing body and mind is the refining of Lead and Mercury.\n\nTo forget emotions and nurture nature, to empty the heart and cultivate spirit, to instantly still the myriad conditions and clarify the hundred thoughts—this is the foundation of the Elixir, likened to the Sacred Embryo.\n\nThe oral instruction says: The wondrous union of heart and breath in the Mysterious School, with a single intent of harmonious merging, is the work of refining. The state of being indistinct and vague, profound and obscure, chaotic and undifferentiated—this is the landscape of refinement. If distinguished in detail, then the interdependence of breath is martial tempering, while the absence of breath in samādhi is civil refinement.\n\nWhat is meant by \"withdrawing-adding\"? It refers to withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. The work lies solely in the word \"settling\"; when body and mind attain great samādhi, the Dao-embryo naturally rounds itself. No contrivance is needed—naturally, there is withdrawal without withdrawing, addition without adding. This is the wondrous function of non-action and non-effort.\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Treatise on Withdrawing-Adding* states: *\"Someone asked about the principle of withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. I replied: I heard from Master Liyang that after obtaining the Medicine and returning it to the cauldron, one nurtures it with the natural true Fire, continuously and subtly present. Within this, the transformations of withdrawing and adding arise spontaneously, without allowing the slightest use of intellect or force. For the Dao is non-action, yet spirit and qi naturally act in accord with the wondrous workings of creation. It is like cooking rice—one and the same principle. When Lead is added to Mercury, it is like water being poured into rice. The water must not be excessive, nor the rice too scant—just as the two eights correspond. With even fire, the water gradually dries while the rice gradually swells, becoming cooked rice. The drying of the water is called withdrawing Lead; the swelling of the rice is called adding Mercury. Withdrawing is not internal reduction—spirit enters qi as heaven’s qi moves within earth, its mechanism concealed. Adding is not external overflow—qi envelops spirit as earth’s qi receives heaven, gradually nurturing growth. Thus, the embryo rounds and spirit transforms, giving rise to a body beyond the body. The wondrousness of creation reaches this point, all occurring naturally, without knowing how or why. If one seeks to understand the how and why of withdrawing and adding, it is no longer natural.\"*\n\nThe *Verse Commentary on the Golden Elixir’s Verification* further states: *\"Yet one must also know that when Lead and Mercury combine to form the Elixir, it is like salt dissolving in water, like glue blending with color. How can one then distinguish which is Lead, which is Mercury, or what can be withdrawn or added? Ah! The Returned Elixir is also emptiness—at this point, idle chatter is in vain.\"*\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* states: *\"Someone asked, ‘What is withdrawing-adding?’ I replied: ‘The body unmoving and qi settled is called withdrawing; spirit settled and heart unmoving is called adding. Body and mind unmoving, spirit congealed and qi bound—this is called returning to the origin. Thus, extracting the yang from Kan to replenish the yin in Li and form Qian is called withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury.’\"*\n\nXuanjing said: *\"When body and mind are unmoving, this is the Great Fixation. Spirit and qi conjoin in stillness, merging into a single crucible. With long-continued quiescent illumination, qi is wholly transformed into spirit, and the numinous radiance shines alone—all phenomena dissolve and fuse. Is this not the sign of the perfected embryo? The Patriarch Lu likened it to cooked rice, a most apt comparison. The essential point of Elixir-making lies in the Great Fixation: when body and mind are quiescent and unmoving, Lead and Mercury return to True Earth. Steaming and refining, withdrawing and adding, bathing and gentle nurturing, shedding the embryo and spiritual transformation—all are contained within it. Thus it is said to be most simple and most easy.\"*\n\n**Ninety-Two: Extracting Kan to Fill Li**\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Extract the solid center from the Kan position,\nTransmute the yin within the Li palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian—\nWhether hidden or soaring, all depends on the heart.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious* states:\n*\"Extract the Elixir from within Kan,\nA golden blossom reveals a single stem.\nAuspicious clouds unfold across the heavens,\nPropitious light fills the gates of death.\"*\n\nThe Mysterious Tradition borrows the images of the *Yijing* to illustrate the Dao of the Elixir. The true yang within Kan is originally Qian’s former property; only after falling into the posterior heaven does Qian break to become Li, and this one yang sink into the Kan position. Now, employing the method of return, one extracts the solid from Kan to fill the hollow in Li, thereby restoring the Qian trigram and reverting from old age to youth. When the practitioner’s cultivation reaches the point of utter emptiness and profound stillness, the whole body softens and numbs—this is precisely the moment when the three yang of Kan enter. Nurturing it with the Great Fixation, gradually gathering and congealing, one proceeds until the Elixir forms, and the work of extracting Kan to fill Li is complete. The crucial point is to recognize the one move beyond the body’s empty space, for then extraction has its locus.\n\nThis image of extracting Kan to fill Li traces its origin to Nüwa’s smelting stones to mend the heavens. Even in Zhuangzi’s *Free and Easy Wandering*, the passage *\"The roc charts its course southward\"* subtly reveals this image. The *Free and Easy Wandering* states:\n*\"In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. When it rises in flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. The *Qi Xie* records strange matters. It says: When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, the water churns for three thousand miles. It mounts upon the whirlwind and ascends ninety thousand miles, departing on the sixth-month gale.\"*\n\nThis passage arrives as if cleaving the void, sweeping across with unbridled force.\n\nThose who do not understand dismiss it as mere absurdity; to those who have grasped the secret, it is immediately clear as the work of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li.\" Let me briefly interpret its imagery:\n\nThe fish in the Northern Darkness symbolizes the true yang within Kan, for Kan resides in the north. Its transformation into a bird signifies the moment when qi stirs with the season. \"Rising in flight\" denotes the upward surge of qi. \"Its wings like clouds hanging from the sky\" describes the billowing ascent, white qi filling the void—just as Lü Zu said, \"White clouds ascend to the upper gate,\" and as Master Zi Yang put it, \"At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains.\" The Southern Darkness represents Li in the south. Zhuangzi’s pairing of north and south mirrors the opposition of Li and Kan. This bird’s migration from north to south—is this not the movement of *wu* flowing to *ji*, the very process of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\"?\n\nZhuangzi’s analogy of Kun and Peng refers precisely to the true yang qi. This primordial qi is vast and unyielding, so immense that none can measure its thousands of miles. When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, \"the water churns for three thousand miles\"—these three thousand miles signify the three yang of Qian. \"Mounting the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand miles\" refers to the nine of Qian. In the alchemical practice of \"fierce fire refinement\" (where heart and breath interdepend externally), the image of nine is employed; in \"gentle fire nurturance\" (where breath ceases in samadhi), the image of six is used. Movement corresponds to Qian, stillness to Kun. The true yang within Kan is originally Qian’s own essence, hence the three thousand and ninety thousand both align with Qian’s imagery.\n\nAs the true yang ascends, the bellows are stirred to aid its progress, lest it stall midway. Fire blazes with wind, surging through the three barriers to pierce the crown of the head—this is the subtlety of employing nine. The following line, \"departing on the sixth-month gale,\" refers to the six lines of Kun. Kun embodies stillness. Here, at the gate of Kun’s return, stillness reaches its extreme and gives rise to movement. Receiving this true yang qi of Qian, refined with gentle fire, the Elixir of Return is formed, replenishing primordial yang to restore the Qian state—this is called \"rejuvenation.\" Nine is the number of yang, yet within it, the six yin symbols are already implicit.\n\nThis passage is profoundly esoteric; for two thousand years, no one has fully expounded its meaning—truly, discerning truth is difficult. Liu Xin classified the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi as Daoist, while categorizing the esoteric scriptures of immortals under \"miscellaneous arts,\" revealing his failure to grasp the source of the Dao. Is the cultivation of immortals not the Dao? Did Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, and Guan Yin not succeed in Daoist practice and become immortals? The principles of alchemical classics do not exceed those of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Guan Yin, and their peers; they merely employ symbolic language, making comprehension elusive.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* claimed, \"Laozi’s discussions are too broad and vague, while Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Guan Yin, and their followers, though following the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, never reached the ultimate teachings, remaining a thousand *li* from the path of immortality.\" Alas! Such a statement betrays a lack of reflection. In this collection, the profound meanings of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Guan Yin, and others are fully revealed and exhaustively expounded. If Ge Hong were to see this, one wonders what his reaction would be!\n\n---\n\n**93. Jade Refinement and Gold Refinement**\nThe Mystic School speaks of \"jade liquid refining the form\" and \"gold liquid refining the form,\" later termed *jade refinement* and *gold refinement*. Jade is prized for its warmth and luster; where jade lies hidden in the mountains, grasses and trees never wither. The human body is the same—when true qi is abundant, the skin glows, the complexion brightens, and one’s spirit becomes robust and flourishing. The *Cantong Qi* states, \"The yellow center gradually permeates reason, its moisture reaching the skin\"—this is the effect of jade refinement.\n\nGold is valued for its indestructibility, like the unbreakable vajra. After attaining the Great Return Elixir through cultivation, one transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood, the Dharma body enduring eternally, unharmed through kalpas. Hence, the term *gold refinement*, and the Elixir is called the *Golden Elixir*. Traditionally, practitioners often regard inner nurturance—serene and non-action—as *jade refinement*, while the refinement of the Great Return Elixir, the transformation of the spirit and shedding of the mortal form, is called *gold refinement*. The distinction between the Lesser and Great Returns is thus framed as *jade* and *gold refinement*, yet the practice fundamentally revolves around the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nWhen one reaches the state of great samadhi, internally, the seven returns occur, the lead cauldron warming gently. Externally, the nine returns manifest, the primordial unity of qi responding to every stimulus, merging with body and mind into a single furnace, forged into one. This is the simultaneous nurturance of inner and outer, the unity of heaven and humanity—golden resonance and jade vibration, all pervaded by one principle.\n\n---\n\n**94. Subduing Qi and Ingesting Qi**\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Subdue qi without ingesting it; ingest qi only after subduing it.\nIngesting qi does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing qi.\"*\n\nTo subdue qi is to guide qi with spirit, heart and breath interdependent, transforming ordinary breath into true breath—the wondrous mystery of the primordial natural Dao, the true essence of the unity of nature and life. Ingesting qi is a method of post-heaven intention, akin to what moderns call \"breathing fresh air\"—exhaling the old and inhaling the new, like Western deep breathing or China’s ancient practices of \"preserving spirit and swallowing qi.\" Unaware of the crucial step of transcending the void outside the body, one cannot attain the marvel of true breathlessness, relying instead on post-heaven respiration to draw in air. Such practices of exhalation, inhalation, and guiding qi merely bring comfort and longevity.\n\nSubduing qi, however, severs external respiration, returning breath to the origin. Body and mind settle into stillness, the true void within sensing the wondrous existence beyond. Wondrous existence and true void merge seamlessly, forged into one, coalescing into the Dao embryo. Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood—its power is immense.\n\nPurple Clarity Elder said: \"Refining the elixir with fire to form the cinnabar is precisely guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao.\" This is the teaching of subduing qi. Subduing qi begins with regulating breath.\n\nXu Jingsun said: \"Internally harmonizing true qi while preserving breath, naturally the transformations of creation restore youthful countenance.\" Cao Wenyu said: \"Concentrating qi to achieve softness, spirit lingers long; the coming and going of true breath flows effortlessly.\" Lü Zu said: \"Cease striving at the alchemical furnace and river chariot; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath extend endlessly.\" Longmeizi said: \"Breathing yin and yang should be silent; regulating inhalation and exhalation must be continuous.\" All these speak to the essence of regulating breath. When breath is regulated to stillness, the work of subduing qi manifests.\n\n**95. Ordinary Breath and True Breath**\nOrdinary breath is the inhalation and exhalation through our mouth and nose. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. Exhalation expands and belongs to yang; inhalation contracts and belongs to yin. This breath through the mouth and nose begins when we leave the womb, hence it is called ordinary breath. All ordinary people, day and night, never depart from this breath.\n\nThe alchemical school employs the method of mind and breath interdependent, uniting mind with breath. Spirit and qi merge, gradually harmonizing and refining until they seem to exist yet not exist. At this time, the eighty-four thousand pores open, true qi steams and permeates, blending into blissful ease—soft, tranquil, and indescribable. As Zhang Jinghe’s *Tai Xi Jue* says: \"Like fish in a spring pond, like hibernating insects. Vast qi fuses, numinous winds stir. Neither turbid nor clear, neither mouth nor nose. No going, no coming, no exiting, no entering.\" This is the true realm.\n\nWhen ordinary breath ceases, true breath naturally appears. Once true breath appears, true qi naturally arises, yang fire advances, and yin tally retreats. Thus it is said: the breath that does not breathe is called true breath.\n\n**96. Mysterious Breath and Embryonic Breath**\nThe *Da Dong Jing* states: \"Stabilize harmony, wondrous clarity, and mysterious breath ensures longevity.\" Mysterious breath is true breath, also called embryonic breath, spirit breath, or tortoise breath. When spirit and qi embrace, the mind holds no thoughts, with no going or coming, external breath ceases, and the embryo congeals—hence it is also called embryonic breath, resembling the breath of an infant in the womb.\n\nMaster Ma said: \"The cavernous void is pure and still; mysterious breath flows unimpeded, without obstruction, inner and outer both clear.\" He also said: \"Let not the thunderous void startle you; receiving the register, golden blossoms yield jade essence. Nurturing clarity to return to the Great Beginning, continuous mysterious breath ensures longevity.\"\n\nThe term \"mysterious\" means that one’s breath aligns with the breath of the void and the breath of heaven and earth. Thus one can seize the creative power of heaven and earth, congealing the numinous elixir in an instant. If external breath does not cease, it cannot be called mysterious. This embryonic breath is the precursor to the return in the Mysterious School. One must grasp the crucial step of the void beyond the body, entering qi with spirit, gradually regulating and harmonizing, refining and subtling, until breath naturally stills, the body merges with the void, and one dissolves into samādhi—only then does one enter the wondrous realm of mysterious breath.\n\n**97. Responding to Stars and Responding to Tides**\nMaster Cui’s *Ru Yao Jing* speaks of \"heaven responding to stars, earth responding to tides.\" Commentators have expounded much on principle but revealed little of the secret. From my observation, it precisely illustrates the image of mind and breath interdependent.\n\nHow so? Heaven responding to stars refers to the fire within *li*, a single point of spirit-light—our own numinous awareness. Reflecting inward and congealing into the qi cavity, like starlight shining downward, the *kan* water receives the steaming of the *li* sun, naturally transforming into ascending qi, like the tide flowing upstream. This is the wondrous function of the five phases inverted: fire, which flames upward, is made to descend; water, which flows downward, is made to ascend. Thus *kan* and *li* merge, and water and fire assume the image of completion.\n\nThe secret says: When mind and breath externally align, heart-fire does not flame upward but shines downward. Once heart-light shines downward, kidney-water naturally transforms into ascending qi and no longer rushes downward. When postnatal yin and yang merge, body and mind settle into stillness, naturally achieving the arising of yang in quiescence. When the time arrives, the wondrous principle manifests: the single yang within *kan* surges upward, the true fluid within *li* descends, metal and water merge, the four images unite, and the work of seven returns is accomplished.\n\nThus, when mind and breath externally align, *kan* and *li* internally merge. Responding to stars and tides is like an echo answering a call—its marvel is beyond conception.\n\n**98. Profound Obscurity and Primal Obscurity**\n*Laozi* said: \"Profound, obscure—within it lies essence.\" *Zhuangzi* said: \"The essence of the supreme Dao is profoundly obscure.\" Lü Zu said: \"How to recognize the profoundly profound Dao? The Dao lies in profound obscurity—examine it closely.\" He also said: \"Profoundly obscure, obscurely profound, born of vagueness; vaguely, hazily, it coalesces into a mass.\" Li Daochun said: \"Vast qi congeals spirit in profound obscurity, emerging from existence and entering non-existence in vagueness.\"\n\nAn ancient immortal said: \"True lead is not produced within the five metals; it is born in profound obscurity before heaven and earth.\" Ning Xuanzhi said: \"Not in worldly toil, not in mountains—seek directly the source of profound obscurity.\" Chaoyuanzi said: \"The enlightened ruler governs, myriad states clear; a single stream of the Yellow River connects to profound obscurity.\" He also said: \"Profoundly, obscurely, primally harmonious—white and clear. Three return to the homeland; the heir apparent returns to the eastern sea.\"\n\nCangmingzi said: \"Within the vague and obscure, there is an image—only then does one know the utmost mystery of creation.\" He also said: \"Water and fire ascend and descend into the Yellow Court; the union of true essence congeals in profound obscurity.\" Chen Xiyi said: \"When profound obscurity just reveals a trace, the vague and hazy still do not distinguish self from other.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"Within profound obscurity, there is trust; in vagueness, there is no seeing or hearing.\" Wang Yangming said: \"Leisurely observing the forms of things, all teem with life; in stillness, one awakens to heaven’s mechanism and enters profound obscurity.\"\n\nSuch verses and gathas are too numerous to cite in full. In sum, *yaoming* (\"profound obscurity\") is where spirit and qi merge in darkness, entering a state like drunkenness yet not drunkenness—this is the sign of embryonic breathing. Only when spirit and qi unite can one summon primordial true yang. Then, within stillness, movement arises, and true essence is born. Thus, to gather the primordial, one must deeply enter profound obscurity, attain utmost emptiness and profound stillness, and respond to every stimulus—naturally, the medicine takes form with an image.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: \"Exhaust life and fulfill emotion, and heaven and earth rejoice while all affairs vanish. All things return to their nature—this is called *hunming* ('chaotic obscurity').\" Lu Fanghu said: \"Life is what heaven bestows; emotion is what nature emits. Exhaust life and fulfill emotion, and the center is attained, harmony is also attained. Thus, above and below flow as one with heaven and earth, and the burdens of things are entirely dissolved. Hence it is said: 'Heaven and earth rejoice while all affairs vanish.' 'All things return to their nature'—this is called *hunming*: restraining one’s nature and returning to it. When emotion is fully expressed, all expressions are harmonious. Returning to nature means being utterly still and motionless, returning to the center. Returning to the center, one is dim and silent, equal to the primordial chaos. Hence it is said: 'This is called *hunming*.' The art of chaos is nothing but this cultivation.\"\n\nXuanjing said: *Hunming* is merging with profound obscurity, the very image of chaos, directly entering the great samadhi of true concentration, blending with the Dharma-realm’s great unity. This is what *Laozi* meant by \"returning to the limitless.\"\n\nThus, from the initial concentration of profound obscurity, one transitions into the great concentration of *hunming*, where the burdens of things are entirely dissolved, and cultivated nature returns to virtue.\n\n---\n\nLaozi said: \"The Dao models itself on spontaneity.\" The *Cantong Qi* said: \"What spontaneity does is no false or deceptive Dao.\" It also said: \"Yang abides in harmony, and nature and emotion are spontaneous.\" Lü Zu said: \"Cease thoughts, forget schemes, and merge with spontaneity.\" The *Zhao Lun* said: \"Serene and profoundly silent, one wondrously accords with spontaneity.\" The *Xinxin Ming* said: \"Observing all dharmas equally, all return to spontaneity.\" It also said: \"Grasping it, one loses measure and must enter deviant paths. Releasing it to spontaneity, the body has no coming or going.\"\n\nCangmingzi said: \"The great Dao is empty and void, following spontaneity. Beyond spontaneity, there is no mystery. Be supple and focus qi like an infant—hungry, seek food; tired, sleep.\" The *Yinfu Jing* said: \"The Dao of spontaneity is still, thus heaven, earth, and the myriad things are born.\" It also said: \"Therefore, the sage knows the Dao of spontaneity cannot be violated and thus regulates it accordingly.\" This is the evidence that both Chan and Daoism value spontaneity.\n\nLaozi also said: \"What cannot be seen is called *yi* ('subtle'); what cannot be heard is called *xi* ('rare'); what cannot be grasped is called *wei* ('minute'). These three cannot be further questioned, so they merge into one.\" He also said: \"Chaotic, as if turbid.\" Dongshan said: \"Chaotic, with nothing to hide—what more is there to seek?\" Caoshan said: \"Chaotic, without inside or outside, harmonious and level above and below.\" He also said: \"Chaotic, concealing principle and phenomena—its signs are utterly obscure. Before the King of Awesome Sound awakened, how could Maitreya be alert?\" This is further evidence that both Chan and Daoism value chaos.\n\nWhat, then, is the ultimate difference?\n\nIt is answered: Returning to the limitless, chaotic and without trace. Principle and phenomena both vanish; merit and rank both conceal—this is called *hunran* (\"chaotic\"). *Hunran* is the image of chaos. *Ziran* (\"spontaneity\") is acting without effort, still and serene—like a bright mirror reflecting images, an empty valley echoing sounds, each following its capacity without imposing the self. This is the wondrous function of the true Dao.\n\nThe excellence of *hunran* is the virtue of chaotic completion—this is the wondrous essence of the Dao. In terms of practice: when mind and breath interdepend to utmost purity, the mind naturally follows the breath, and the breath naturally follows the mind, without allowing the self to arise in intention or arrangement. Even all firing times must not be controlled by the self. When the tally naturally accords, this is the primordial realm, the verification of wondrously merging with spontaneity.\n\nAs practice deepens, even this wondrous state of spontaneity is forgotten. Chaotic and undifferentiated, unknowing and unaware—even if yang arises, the mind remains utterly still and unmoved, no different from unawareness. At this stage, wondrousness is exhausted and merit is forgotten, returning to simplicity. Profoundly still, the physical body gradually reverts to childlike purity. The Gate of Yang closes, the consciousness-nature gradually transforms, and all unwholesome habits are smelted away. Body and mind both assume the image of childlike purity. This chaotic true realm is the secret key to returning to childhood and the mysterious mechanism of restoring life.\n\nThe *Goulou Bearing the Cicada*, *Boatman Steering the Boat*, *Carpenter Making a Saw*, *Gongchui Turning the Lathe* in Zhuangzi’s *Attaining Life*, and the *Butcher Ding Carving the Ox* in the *Nourishing Life* chapter all illustrate the firing times of spontaneity. As for Ji Sheng’s raising the fighting cock to become a wooden cock—this precisely illustrates the firing times of chaos.\n\n100. **Softness and Numbness**\nThrough the interdependence of heart and breath, long and pure refinement is achieved. The spirit settles with the breath, and the breath transforms with the spirit. At this stage, breathing shifts from the mouth and nose to the pores—opening and closing in harmony with heaven and earth, empty and natural. The true yang of heaven and earth then permeates the four limbs and hundred bones, penetrating the five viscera and six bowels, bringing a sensation of melting softness and bliss. As the practice deepens, the softness intensifies, from the crown to the soles, permeating both inside and out. When softness reaches its extreme, it turns into numbness. This numbness manifests in three distinct forms: first, numbness during the interdependence of heart and breath; second, numbness in the state of dim indistinctness; and third, numbness within profound stillness. To attain numbness in stillness is precisely the moment of circulating the *Small Celestial Cycle*. These subtle transformations of firing times are unrecorded in the myriad volumes of alchemical texts, transmitted only through a master’s oral instruction.\n\n---\n\n101. **Before and After Gui**\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"When lead encounters gui’s arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon’s decline, it is no longer fit to taste.\"* This clarifies gathering before gui. Zhang Sanfeng’s *Xuan Yao Pian* says: *\"The Supreme Dao, proclaimed again, reveals the secret of pre-heaven and post-heaven. It speaks only of lead arising after gui, not of yang arising before gui.\"* It further states: *\"When the lead flower appears at gui’s end, the Western Garden’s branches bloom once more.\"* And: *\"Lead arises after gui, yin and yang divide—just as the first crescent of metal and water fills, like orioles and flowers in spring’s second month.\"* This clarifies gathering after gui. The *Lesser Yang* and *Wenshi* schools diverge in their alchemical formulas—how can they be reconciled?\n\nMaster Xuanjing replied: I once heard from Master Wang that lead is yang, and gui is yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises; when stillness reaches its limit, movement returns. Thus, it is said that lead arises only after gui. Yet the birth of true yang is swift as lightning, unable to linger in the pre-heavenly state. In an instant, it generates gui-water, turning yang into yin. Hence, it is said: *\"When lead encounters gui’s arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"* To gather swiftly at gui’s arising is precisely to act urgently before gui-water emerges. Thus, the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"It cannot be used when seen; when used, it cannot be seen. In dim indistinctness, they meet; in profound obscurity, transformation occurs. In a flash, the flame soars, and the true person naturally appears.\"* Zhang Sanfeng’s *Xuan Yao Pian* also says: *\"Seek the true seed where lightning flashes; trace the root source when the wind’s signal arrives.\"* Thus, whether before or after gui, the true mechanism of gathering holds subtle meanings within. When harmonized, the principle remains unified—they are not in conflict.\n\n---\n\n102. **Yang Fire and Yin Talisman**\nAlchemists speak of advancing yang fire and retreating yin talisman, abbreviated as advancing fire and retreating talisman, also called talisman-fire. Master Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Gather in due time, discerning floating and sinking; advance fire cautiously to avoid peril.\"* And: *\"When the first yang arises in renewal, advance fire without delay.\"* Longmeizi’s *Jindan Yinzheng Shi* says: *\"At the hour of zi, advance fire; at gui, conceal it—this is the morning’s fire-advancing chapter. Respond to yin and yang in silence; regulate breath’s ebb and flow with continuity.\"* And: *\"At the hour of zi, eighteen stars appear—this is the talisman-retreating fire cycle. As tamed ice begins with *Gou*, stored treasures fill *Kun*.\"* Master Qianxu said: *\"Fire is the fire of spirit. Advancing fire nurtures yang; retreating talisman nurtures yin.\"* The *Preface to the Four Hundred Characters* states: *\"Refined with yang fire, it transforms into yang qi; nourished with yin talisman, it transforms into yin essence.\"* The Dao of heaven and earth uses yang to generate and yin to complete. Thus, warmth, heat, cold, and coolness each follow their fixed order, and the myriad things thereby undergo generation, growth, harvest, and storage. The Dao of the golden elixir is no different.\n\nI once posed this question to Master Wang, who replied: *\"These are all metaphorical expressions, like fish traps and rabbit snares. The alchemical method simply involves the interdependence of heart and breath, until external breathing becomes faint, and the entire body melts into soft bliss. When primordial true yang arrives upon you, irrigating and steaming, advancing one part yang naturally retreats one part yin—just as advancing one part light retreats one part darkness. All occurs naturally, leaving no room for the slightest contrivance. This is what Ziyang meant when he said: ‘The great elixir’s method is utterly simple and easy. Its explanation is concise and precise, beyond further elaboration. Even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, will immediately ascend to the realm of sages.’ If one relies on hexagrams, lines, and times to determine advancement and retreat, how could the dull and ignorant endure it?\"*\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Canto on the Measurement of the Cantong Qi* states: *\"Someone asked about advancing fire and retreating talisman. I replied: Fire is the fire of spirit—I already know this. But what is the yin talisman? Does it have any explanation? I heard from my immortal teacher regarding the seven returns and nine refinements: Seven is the number of fire, nine the number of metal. Refining metal with fire to form the elixir is like guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao. From this perspective, the wondrous work of elixir-making begins and ends with a single fire. When advancing, it is fire; when retreating, it is talisman. Talisman means union—speaking of ascent and descent, advance and retreat, inner and outer in harmony. When circulating fire, spirit and qi embrace, holding to the One without separation, continuous as if present. It is but a single fire—where is there room for a yin talisman to be used?\"*\n\nThus, in alignment with the hexagrams *Gou* (䷫), *Dun* (䷠), *Bo* (䷖), *Kun* (䷁), *Pi* (䷋), and *Guan* (䷓), we speak of \"submission,\" \"departure from position,\" \"destruction and harm,\" \"loss and disappearance,\" and \"return to the origin\"—all referring to yin in retreat. Just as after the full moon, yin gradually wanes, its light naturally diminishing, fading bit by bit until it reaches darkness, only to revive again as the new moon, this speaks of yang in advance, not of yin. If we were to speak of yin, we should instead speak of *advancing* talismans.\n\nFrom this perspective, within our own bodies, where is there room for a yin talisman to be used?\n\nFurthermore, the *Discourse on Fire Talismans* states:\n\"Someone asked about the similarities and differences between the advance and retreat of fire talismans, the morning *Tun* (䷂) and evening *Meng* (䷃). I replied: In the past, before receiving my teacher’s guidance, I privately considered the timing of fire difficult to discern. I once measured it against the celestial cycle, aligned it with hexagram qi, divided it by watches and clepsydra—all to no avail. Only later did I suddenly awaken, realizing that the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics and the six hundred fire records could all be discarded in an instant. The so-called true fire has no fixed timing, and the great medicine has no fixed weight—this was no deception.\"\n\nI say: Indeed, as Master Wang has stated, when a single measure of primordial true yang advances, yin qi naturally retreats in equal measure, as if matching tally sticks. This is one explanation.\n\nWhen heart and breath depend on each other, this is *advancing fire*, governing refinement. When this dependence deepens into samadhi and both spirit and breath are forgotten, this is *retreating talisman*, governing nurturance—just as the Perfected One of Hidden Emptiness said. This is another explanation. Movement is yang, stillness is yin; movement governs advance, stillness governs retreat.\n\n**103. Igniting and Extinguishing Fire**\nIn elixir methods, igniting fire means heart and breath depending on each other, while extinguishing fire means forgetting both spirit and breath, entering samadhi in perfect tranquility. This is the common oral instruction.\n\nMy late teacher transmitted three secret methods for extinguishing fire:\n1. **Extinguishing fire during essence refinement.** Without this method, one often becomes attached to the body, risking seminal emission. Whenever yang arises and the external yang stirs, leading to ejaculation, it is always due to ignorance of how to extinguish fire.\n2. **Extinguishing fire during qi refinement.** Without this method, one often risks qi leakage, called \"losing the elixir,\" rendering all prior efforts futile. Even the ancient Perfected One Bai Yuchan was not spared this calamity, as seen in his poem: *\"I must re-rig my fishing rod, / And cut anew the autumn bamboo.\"* How much more so for others? Without knowing the initial method for extinguishing fire, the yang pass cannot be sealed, and the foundation of the elixir cannot be completed. Without knowing the second stage’s method, even with sufficient qi, one cannot form the elixir; after forming it, one cannot nurture it; and after the elixir matures to circulate the great celestial cycle, one cannot *\"reinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod, / Ride the tiger and mount the dragon to transcend the mortal realm.\"*\n3. **Extinguishing fire during spirit refinement.** Without this method, samadhi cannot be perfected, the light of the heart cannot become whole, and one risks the peril of leakage, inevitably regressing to a lesser attainment. The ancient teaching of the three leakages (perception, emotion, and speech) and the principle of manifesting dignified conduct without departing from quiescent samadhi are both essential for verifying the completeness of nature and spirit in samadhi. This stage of extinguishing fire is most critical and most profound. Without it, one cannot refine nature to its subtlety or act without obstruction.\n\nFor four years, I studied under Master Wang. He often spoke of the initial method for extinguishing fire during essence refinement, never concealing it. However, the oral instructions for the latter two stages were only revealed during my final audience in the fourth year. After four years of diligent effort, I obtained them with difficulty and dare not record them carelessly. I treasure and guard them in secret. Scholars need only know that the Western Lineage’s transmission indeed includes three methods for extinguishing fire, ensuring safety, perfection, and transcendence.\n\nFor beginners, when yang first arises, desire is easily stirred, leading to seminal emission. At this moment, a clear teacher must impart the essential method to extinguish the postnatal ministerial fire, so that body and mind remain unmoved and the peril of leakage is avoided. Yet in recent times, many blind teachers do not even know how to remedy the ailment of yang arising and seminal emission, let alone understand the initial method for extinguishing fire during essence refinement. How could they possibly grasp the deeper, secret methods of the second and third stages, which lead to the boundless, freely self-existent state of *\"shattering empty space\"*?\n\nThe leakage of qi during the second stage of qi refinement is called \"losing the elixir.\" In the indistinct, profound state, yang qi surges like wildfire, escaping through the *weilu* (tailbone), impossible to restrain—akin to seminal emission during essence refinement (though one leaks from the front, the other from the rear. After extinguishing fire, the yang pass is sealed, the front path blocked, and leakage occurs through the anus). Bai Yuchan’s *Poem on Failing to Refine the Elixir* says:\n*\"I gathered it into my jade gourd,\nGuarding it closely, daring not to leak.\nAt midnight, thunder and wind suddenly arose,\nSmoke and vapor filled the vast emptiness.\nSuch a state and flavor—\nA mute biting his tongue.\nClutching my belly, I can only laugh,\nLest my heart grow vexed and hot.\nI must re-rig my fishing rod,\nAnd cut anew the autumn bamboo.\"*\n\nThis is the true circumstance of qi leakage. It arises from ignorance of how to extinguish fire, suffering this great calamity. If one leaks again upon re-refining and reaching qi sufficiency, progress in cultivation becomes impossible. Thus, the method for extinguishing fire at this stage is profoundly secret.\n\nSomeone asked: What fire is extinguished in the final stage?\nI answered: The fire of ignorance. If the subtlest ignorance is not purified, nature cannot become whole. Only when ignorance is entirely dissolved and cleansed can one attain the wisdom of leakage’s end and thorough penetration. Having verified the absence of leakage, one transcends both the worldly and supraworldly, attaining unobstructed freedom.\n\nOtherwise, one may attain only the five supernatural powers but not the sixth, which is the secret essential of completing the Dao through final return to emptiness.\n\nThis transmission traces from Ancestor Lü to Ancestor Li, from Ancestor Li to the Perfected One of Western Garden, from the Perfected One to Master Wang, and thence to me. Between these four transmissions, less than a century has passed—truly what Master Qianxu called “the fortune of three lifetimes, the rare encounter of a thousand years.”\n\n**Section 104: The Geng Month and the Full Moon**\n\nThe *Geng* month refers to the moon of the third day. The full moon refers to the moon of the fifteenth day.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: “On the third day it emerges bright, as *zhen* receives *geng* from the west.” The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “When the moon is but a half-wheel bright at the edge of the sky, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl are already heard.” Ancestor Lü instructed Master Qianxu: “When snow mirrors the cold pool and the new moon hangs on the plum branch, only then may the medicine arise.” The Perfected One Qianxu’s *Ode to the Dao De Jing* states: “The young maiden first opens the northern flower; look up to see the *geng* moon, a slanted hook.” All these clarify the meaning of the *geng* month.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: “On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—precisely when the golden essence is at its peak.” Master Shi Xinglin says: “When the wind first stirs in myriad hollows and the moon suddenly rounds over a thousand mountains, swiftly issue the command to circulate the *zhou tian*.” Chen Cuixu says: “On a moonlit night, gazing within, one may gather and conjoin celestial soul and terrestrial soul to form the numinous elixir.” Zhang Sanfeng says: “The moon’s fullness depends on the oral instruction; the marvel of the midnight hour lies in heart transmission.” He also says: “When the moon is full, the jade bud blooms.” All these illustrate the meaning of the full moon.\n\nWhat path should one take?\n\nI answer: The two ancestors, Qianxu and Hanxu, have already clarified this. Qianxu’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Someone asked, ‘You speak of the fifteenth day of the eighth month and also of the third day when *geng* emerges—what is the meaning?’ I replied, ‘The fifteenth symbolizes the sufficiency of the metal-water *qi*; the third symbolizes the freshness of the metal-water medicine. If *qi* is insufficient, water will not arise. When considered together, the meaning becomes clear.’”\n\nAncestor Hanxu says: “The newly appearing yang light is the evening of the third day. The fullness of metal-water is the night of the fifteenth. When alchemists speak of the third day and also of the fifteenth, the third symbolizes the freshness of the metal-water *qi*, while the fifteenth symbolizes its sufficiency. If *qi* is insufficient, water will not arise. The third and fifteenth must be regarded as one moment, envisioned as one continuous thread—one must not calculate by counting numbers.”\n\nThe oral instruction states: When the scholar’s practice reaches great samadhi, forgetting form and image, abiding in emptiness and stillness, then the primordial *qi* will arise abundantly, like the full moon—this is what is meant by “when the source is clear, the *qi* is surely sufficient.” Within samadhi, at the first awakening of yang, when it aligns with the natural rhythm and turns outward in dependence, without stirring a single thought, then the yang *qi* is pure and fresh, not old but tender, like the moon of the third day. Thus, the *geng* month and the full moon point to the flourishing of the medicine and the freshness of the sprout—their meaning is consistent, not contradictory.\n\nWhen samadhi is sufficient, *qi* flourishes; when departure from the body is swift, the medicine is fresh. In this way, send it back to the earthen crucible and re-enter great samadhi. Then the *zhou tian* practice will be without error, the gathering and nurturing will be proper, and the verification of the returned elixir will be visible in days—is this not the essential key to restoration?\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Someone asked, ‘Why is tender medicine usable?’ I replied, ‘In the *qi* of creation, what has accomplished its work retreats, and what is to come advances. It is like brewing wine: the three-day ferment, though floating and slight, can transform a thousand jars. At this time, the flavor may be faint, yet the vital impulse is vigorous. If it has already ripened into wine, it cannot be used again.’”\n\nThe harvesting of medicine takes the tender precisely for this reason.\" This is appended here for reference.\n\n**105. The Toad and the Hare’s Spirit**\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*\"On the third day, clarity emerges,\nZhen receives Geng from the west.\nOn the eighth, Dui receives Ding,\nThe first quarter hangs straight as a cord.\nBy the fifteenth, Qian’s body is complete,\nFullness abounds in Jia’s eastern realm.\nThe toad and the hare’s spirit,\nSun and moon’s *qi* shine as one.\nThe toad gazes at the hexagram’s node,\nThe hare spits forth radiant light.\"*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* employs the two images of the toad and the hare’s spirit as most wondrous. Master Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* follows this, saying:\n*\"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow—\nPrecisely when metal’s essence is robust and flourishing.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"If you ask what true lead is,\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River.\"*\n\nMaster Xu Shenweng says:\n*\"Resplendent, the golden flower of sun and moon’s essence,\nFlowing, the jade liquid of heaven and earth’s marrow.\nDeep in the night, the sky’s expanse is free of dust,\nOnly the toad’s light illumines the divine water.\"*\n\nAn ancient worthy’s poem reads:\n*\"On the Western River’s bank, raise your gaze—\nA tide of toad-light dips into emerald waves.\nNow is the time to refine the two eights with care,\nDiligently entrusting it to the Yellow Dame.\"*\n\nAll trace their origin to the *Cantong Qi*’s image of the toad.\n\nMaster Qianxu the Perfected’s *Ceshu* states:\n*\"Those who speak of the moon today use many names—\nSome call it the toad, others the hare’s spirit.\nYet the toad and the hare’s spirit must be distinguished:\nThe toad is the moon’s essence, while the hare’s spirit is the moon’s body.\nNow, the moon’s light is borrowed from the sun,\nThus the *qi* of sun and moon must face each other to generate brightness—\nThis is the natural principle of yin and yang’s gestation.\nYet yang arises gradually:\nThe toad’s birth depends on the hexagram’s node.\nAs yang beneath the hexagram grows, the toad’s essence gradually forms,\nAnd only then does the hare spit it forth to generate light.\"*\n\nMaster Xuanjing says: The toad symbolizes the *qi* of primordial true yang. When the practitioner’s work reaches great samadhi, Qian and Kun naturally unite. Stillness gives rise to movement, and when true yang arrives, the toad’s light appears. Swiftly direct it outward with a single touch, maintaining unmoving mindfulness. Thus true yang will not escape, and you may send it back to the earthen crucible for secure sealing. The toad lurking at the water’s bottom symbolizes metal within water. The hare’s spirit, illuminated by the sun’s light, symbolizes the medicine’s production after the union of spirit and *qi*.\n\n**106. Divine Water and the Flowery Pond**\nMaster Yuchan’s *Danfa Cantong* states:\n*\"The heart’s source, the ocean of nature, is called the Flowery Pond.\nNature is like water—it is called divine water.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme alchemy of the highest vehicle. Master Ziyang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The Flowery Pond’s lotus blooms,\nDivine water’s golden waves are still.\nDeep in the night, the moon is bright—\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\"*\n\nThese four lines offer vivid metaphors that resonate with Master Yuchan’s words.\n*\"The Flowery Pond’s lotus blooms\"* describes the blossoming of the heart’s flower, the revelation of nature’s light. Master Yuxi says:\n*\"Split open the Great Ultimate’s bud,\nRevealing the heart of heaven and earth.\nThe void’s expanse knows no bounds—\nA sliver of moon appears above the solitary peak.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the flower’s bloom.\n\n*\"Divine water’s golden waves are still\"* describes the ocean of nature’s waves calmed, the winds of circumstance stilled, the waves of consciousness unarisen—profoundly settled and at rest.\n\n*\"Deep in the night, the moon is bright\"* and the following line illustrate the principle of pure clarity and luminous reflection, where all phenomena merge in emptiness. *Zhuangzi* says: *\"When the great vessel is settled, radiance issues from celestial light.\"* The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:\n*\"When numinous light enters brilliance, the ten thousand spirits arise together.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The black pearl reveals its true form,\nWithin and without, all is luminously clear.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The source’s purity shines with light,\nIts cultivation bears fruit.\nIn quiescence and wondrous awareness,\nMysterious breath naturally grants long life.\"*\nThis is its meaning.\n\nSome take the mouth as the Flowery Pond and saliva as divine water—this is the alchemy of the lower grade. Others take the union of *qi* and spirit as the Flowery Pond and the entry of spirit into *qi* as divine water—this is the alchemy of the middle grade. But Master Yuchan’s teaching transcends form, body, spirit, and *qi*, thus belonging to the most supreme vehicle. Nature and heaven unfold in clarity, perfectly round and purely wondrous, utterly beyond the reach of thought—deeply accordant with the ancient sages’ principle of *\"the constant virtue knows no deviation.\"*\n\n**107. Heaven’s Root and the Moon’s Grotto**\nThe Song Confucian Shao Yaofu’s poem reads:\n*\"Eyes and ears keen, a man’s body—\nThe great potter’s gift is no poverty.\nOnly by exploring the moon’s grotto do you know things,\nWithout gathering heaven’s root, how can you know man?\nWhen Qian meets Xun, observe the moon’s grotto;\nWhen earth meets thunder, see heaven’s root.\nRoaming between heaven’s root and the moon’s grotto,\nAll thirty-six palaces are spring.\"*\n\nThis poem, *\"Chant on Observing Things,\"* subtly contains the alchemical transformations of the Daoist school. For the alternation of firing times does not depart from movement and stillness. Within movement there is stillness, within stillness there is movement. When movement and stillness unite, quiescence and responsiveness never part—only then is its wonder fully realized.\n\nThus Kun is earth, stillness. Zhen is thunder, movement. When earth meets thunder, it forms the hexagram *Fu*—this is called *Heaven’s Root*, precisely the moment of utter emptiness and profound stillness when one yang returns. That primordial *qi* emerges from the formless, and when the time arrives, the spirit knows. The *\"knower of man\"* refers to the pure yang’s master, the *qi* of primordial true *yi*.\n\nQian is heaven. When Qian meets Xun, it forms the hexagram *Gou*—this is called *the Moon’s Grotto*, precisely the time of gentle fire after obtaining the medicine and returning it to the crucible for nurturing. Yang has stirred, yin has stilled—then gather and withdraw it. *Heaven’s Root* reveals the mechanism of generation, while *the Moon’s Grotto* signifies the intent of retreat and concealment.\n\nUnderstanding the meaning of *Heaven’s Root* and *the Moon’s Grotto*, one’s gathering, nurturing, bathing, sealing, and securing will all align with the proper measure. As *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"Once Fu and Gou are mastered in application, who can say the golden elixir will not succeed?\"* Generally, the marvel of creation lies in the reversal of yin and yang—*Heaven’s Root* initiates at the fore, while *the Moon’s Grotto* observes completion thereafter. This is what is meant by *\"what continues it is goodness; what completes it is nature.\"* *\"Thirty-six palaces all abloom with spring\"* precisely illustrates the fire-timing without error, the harmony of yin and yang, where every corner of the heart brims with spring. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *\"Primordial qi, postnatal qi—who attains it remains ever as if intoxicated.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Life and Returning to Nature**\n\nThe ancient sage said: *\"Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life; returning to life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"Use the heart to return to the heart.\"* Returning the heart is returning to nature. This teaching of returning to life and returning to nature is the profound subtlety of the Daoist school’s cultivation of nature and reversal of virtue, the wondrous path of thorough realization of the true and constant.\n\nThe study of returning to life requires returning the self to emptiness and quiescence, for only emptiness can respond. The practitioner, through the interdependence of heart and breath, directly enters the state of great samadhi. When samadhi endures and stillness prevails, this is called returning to the root. Returning to the root means moving from activity back to stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme, it reverts to movement—primordial *qi* responds to resonance, and I respond to it with movement. Externally, heart and breath interdepend; spirit and *qi* unite as one, abiding in samadhi without reckless dispersion. This is *\"seeking the mysterious in the water palace, stirring the wind of Xun to move the fire of Kun.\"* Then, through the interdependence of heart and breath, gradually shift from martial fire to civil fire. When spirit and breath both forget, one enters great samadhi again. Thus, the prior and posterior heavens each find their place; inner and outer harmonize; body and mind become serene and joyful. The true *yi*’s *qi* obtained is then sent to the earthen crucible for secure sealing—only then may one conclude a single cycle of practice.\n\nTherefore, the study of returning to life must undergo three reversals: from movement to stillness, from extreme stillness back to movement, and from movement again to stillness. Master Wang once told me: *\"One samadhi before yang arises, one samadhi after yang arises. The former samadhi awaits the birth of the medicine and the resonance of true yang; the latter samadhi serves for bathing, nurturing, sealing, and secure concealment.\"* The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence*’s *\"three reversals day and night\"* likely refers to this stage of work. This is the esoteric mystery of the Daoist school’s return to life, which must pass through *\"three reversals\"* to accomplish the task.\n\nReturning to nature is the Daoist school’s principle of *\"dawn’s clarity revealing the solitary.\"* As Master Ziyang said: *\"There is nothing that is not my heart; there is nothing that is my self.\"* He also said: *\"Shatter the empty void to see the whole body.\"* Li Daochun said: *\"Shatter the empty void to attain great awakening.\"* And again: *\"Lift it clearly to reveal the whole body, then must break through the pivot of primordial unity.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"Round and luminous, this one point no thousand sages have transmitted.\"* Master Miaozheng said: *\"The great radiant mirror shines brilliantly; all things and I are reflected within. The wondrous body ever abides in stillness, its light illuminating the six gates.\"* In such vast clarity of spirit, essence and function are thusness itself. Transcending this upward path, one attains what is called *\"great rest\"* and *\"great freedom.\"* Abiding in the ever-quiescent light, one may walk arm in arm with all buddhas and tathagatas—this may be called the full fruition of bodhi.\n\n---\n\n**Action and Non-Action**\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"At first, those who act are rarely seen; only when non-action is reached do the multitudes recognize it. Yet seeing non-action as essential, who knows that action is the foundation?\"* Here, action and non-action are presented together. Master Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into the Dao De Jing* says: *\"All action is illusion; non-action is also illusion, yet not a trivial one. Dismissing both action and non-action still leaves illusion—only when clouds disperse does the moon shine clear in the empty sky.\"* How, then, to reconcile them?\n\nIt is said: When heart and breath interdepend within external emptiness, one neither clings to action nor falls into void. It is both action and non-action, neither action nor non-action—only then does one accord with the Dao’s wonder and manifest its wondrous function. Thus, Master Qianxu also composed a verse: *\"Originally there was neither being nor non-being; do not vainly seek non-being in the great void. Recognize the true wondrous function of spontaneity—ten thousand rivers’ bright moons are but a single solitary wheel.\"* Reading this verse, one knows the Daoist school’s purport lies elsewhere.\n\nSomeone may ask: *\"The *Diamond Sutra* says: ‘All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows.’ Does not the Daoist practice of refining essence, refining *qi*, refining spirit fall into action? If it is action, it remains but a dream. If it is non-action, why speak of refining?\"*\n\nThe answer: *\"You know only action and non-action, but not acting without attachment. Acting without attachment means moving all day yet never having moved—what concern is there for action? The *Diamond Sutra* is no different: it speaks of emptiness throughout, without clinging to form, yet does not fall into annihilation. The sutra’s saying ‘give rise to the heart without abiding anywhere’—is this not the meaning of spirit and *qi* uniting in emptiness? Again, in the ‘Sequence’ chapter, it describes ‘putting on robes, holding the alms bowl, going and returning for alms, washing the feet, arranging the seat.’ Upon seeing this, Subhuti praises: ‘Rare, World-Honored One!’ Now, what is the purport of the ‘Sequence’ chapter, and whence comes Subhuti’s praise? If you do not fault the World-Honored One for putting on robes, holding the alms bowl, washing feet, and arranging the seat, why fault the Daoist for refining essence, refining *qi*, refining spirit? The ancient immortals said: ‘The elixir is refined within non-refinement; the Dao is practiced within non-practice.’\"*\n\n\"‘Act without acting, and nothing is left undone; nothing is left undone, yet there is no acting—only then does one accord with the wondrous Dao.’ Master Sengzhao said: ‘Because of non-action, though in motion, one remains ever quiescent; because nothing is left undone, though quiescent, one remains ever in motion—thus things cannot be reduced to oneness. Though in motion, one remains ever quiescent—thus things cannot be divided into twoness, and the more one moves, the more quiescent one becomes.’ Things cannot be reduced to oneness, and the more quiescent one becomes, the more one moves—this is how acting is non-acting. Though motion and quiescence differ, there is no distinction to be made between them. How can one say that to have acting is to have acting, and to have non-acting is to have non-acting? The bodhisattva abides in the dharma-gate of equality between exhaustion and non-exhaustion, neither exhausting conditioned action nor abiding in non-action—this is the meaning. One may contemplate it thus.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Then how are dream, illusion, bubble, and shadow to be dissolved?\"\nThe reply: \"Who knows dream, illusion, bubble, and shadow? Who speaks of dream, illusion, bubble, and shadow? Does the one who knows dream, illusion, bubble, and shadow still become dream, illusion, bubble, and shadow?\"\nHmm! ○ ○ ○\nAttaining quiescence and attaining harmony.\n\nThe *Datong Sutra* states: \"Attaining quiescence, one does not move; attaining harmony, one does not shift.\" Master Hanxu’s *Concise Explication* says: \"Quiescence without movement is samādhi; harmony without shifting is peace.\" As for the profound teaching, only when the heart and breath harmonize and merge do the body and mind attain dual quiescence, becoming utterly still. The more quiescent the body and mind, the more harmonious the qi, until external breath ceases entirely, and one abides in great samādhi. Within samādhi, the prior and posterior heavens naturally unite, entering true quiescence. Only then does \"supreme harmony overflow, and bones scatter like cold jade.\"\n\nThe Old Sage said: \"Quiescence is lord over restlessness,\" and \"Though there be glory to behold, one dwells in serenity, transcendent.\" He also said: \"To know harmony is to know constancy.\" Quiescence and harmony—these are the great principles of the profound teaching, the model for sagely cultivation.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Great Master\" chapter states: \"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It may be transmitted but not received, attained yet not seen.\" The Old Sage said: \"Dark and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.\"\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: The Dao is true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, thus it manifests wondrous being. Sentiment and trustworthiness are the signs of wondrous being. What is sentiment? It is movement arising from extreme quiescence, resonance through response—what is called \"the return of the yang.\" When the prior-heaven qi arrives, the time comes and the spirit knows. The arrival of qi is the living *zi* hour; the knowing of the spirit is the living *wu* hour. Metal returns to essence—this response to that stimulus accords with the natural tally. Departing from the physical body, when the heart and breath depend on each other externally, the work of gathering is achieved.\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence Sutra* says: \"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. The sage, compelled, names it the Dao. It is without form, without action—yet why does it have sentiment and trustworthiness? Laozi said: 'Vague and indistinct, within it there is something; dim and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.' These few lines are the secret treasury of discourse on the Dao through the ages. Zhuangzi’s learning derives from Laozi, and he directly speaks of sentiment and trustworthiness. What are sentiment and trustworthiness? They are spoken from the perspective of observing its subtleties through desire. Essence is the movement of quiescence; trustworthiness is the tally of movement. The word 'trustworthiness' is especially secret. A thousand sages and ten thousand perfected ones share this single key. Only with a teacher’s transmission can one realize it. Thus it is said to be transmissible, yet not receivable—meaning it cannot be seen.\"\n\nIn my view, what Laozi calls \"essence\" is what Zhuangzi calls \"sentiment.\" The *Awakening to Reality* says: \"In vagueness they meet, in obscurity there is transformation; in a flash, a flame flies, and the true person naturally appears.\" The *Essentials of the Profound* says: \"Seek the true seed where lightning flashes (this is essence, sentiment); when the tally of the wind arrives (this is the sign of trustworthiness), find the original source.\" These few lines suffice.\n\n---\n\nThe purport of prior-heaven and posterior-heaven is explained in two layers.\n\nFirst, as mutual opposition. For example, the emptiness outside the body is prior-heaven, while all within the physical body is posterior-heaven. Again, original essence and original qi are formless substances, called prior-heaven; the essence of intercourse and the qi of respiration, having fallen into form, are called posterior-heaven. Thus, through mutual opposition, the purport of prior and posterior heaven is elucidated.\n\nSecond, as progressive depth, the unfolding of practice. For instance, if harmonizing heart and breath is prior-heaven, then the usual state without practice is posterior-heaven. From harmonizing heart and breath, one enters vagueness and obscurity—then vagueness and obscurity become prior-heaven, while harmonizing heart and breath becomes posterior-heaven. Advancing further from vagueness and obscurity to great samādhi, where breath has no exhalation or inhalation, the heart no arising or ceasing, inner and outer are forgotten, and roots and dust are extinguished—then great samādhi becomes prior-heaven, while vagueness and obscurity become posterior-heaven. From great samādhi, one reaches complete emptiness and non-arising, emptying not only body, mind, roots, and dust, but even the form of samādhi itself. Space is pulverized, and the measure of the dharma-realm vanishes—then the pulverization of space becomes prior-heaven, while great samādhi becomes posterior-heaven. With each advance, it is like ascending a nine-tiered terrace. Progressing from lower to higher learning depends entirely on the practitioner’s effort in cultivation.\n\n---\n\nMaster Zhang Sanfeng said: \"Before encountering a true person, the scholar should be cautious and humble, accumulating merit and virtue. Do not retreat when facing demons, do not resent when slandered. Upon meeting a true person, seek earnestly and persistently, breaking through the two true messages within and without the body, so as not to be deluded by others.\"\n\nHe also said: \"If the practitioner knows the two true messages within and without the body, clearly and without obstruction, then proceed to nurture and refine, eliminating self-interest and restoring heavenly principle. The work of returning the elixir becomes most simple and easy—daily gathering the yellow sprouts outside the body to await the prior-heaven’s jade nectar. This is truly the wondrous realization of 'drinking wine and wearing flowers' to attain immortality.\"\n\nLet us now discuss this: The emptiness outside the body, in the Dao, is the beginning of the nameless heaven and earth; in the *Book of Changes*, it is Fu Xi’s prior-heaven trigrams, with *qian* to the south and *kun* to the north. The *kan* and *li* within the body are the images of King Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams.\n\nTo practice the work of returning and restoration, one must begin with the emptiness outside the body, forgetting form and exhausting thoughts—only then can one \"precede Heaven without opposing it.\" If one seeks only within the physical form, one can merely \"follow Heaven’s timing in the posterior realm.\" Thus, *qian* and *kun* must serve as the host, while *kan* and *li* as the guest; the Dharma-body as the host, and the physical form as the guest. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states, \"Though others take the lead, I remain the guest.\" This distinction between inner and outer, host and guest, and the boundaries of prior and posterior Heaven must be thoroughly understood and firmly believed without doubt—only then can the work of returning and restoration proceed. When the great function manifests, one will not be misled by the physical form. *Journey to the West* illustrates this with Zhu Bajie, who symbolizes the human body: all demonic obstacles arise because Tang Sanzang mistakenly trusts his words and suffers greatly—this warns of the harm in clinging to the physical form. The *Compendium of Divine Immortals* records how the Dark Warrior ascended from beneath the Abandoned-Body Cliff, truly demonstrating the effect of transcending the physical form. \"Abandoning the body\" means that as practice deepens and true emptiness in great samadhi is attained, body and mind remain unmoved—whether the physical form is cut by blades, scorched by fire, sawed apart, or experiences pleasure, numbness, softness, or tremors, one remains steadfast externally, utterly unmoved, neither attending to nor clinging to it. As the *Yongjia Zhengdao Ge* states: \"Even if an iron wheel spins atop the head, perfect clarity in samadhi and wisdom remains unlost.\" Zhang Xujing said: \"Let it be, pay it no mind, leave it alone—it is what it is (all referring to the physical form), and what can it do to me?\" Only when one truly departs from the physical form, without the slightest attachment, does one enter the true prior Heaven. If Tang Sanzang had heeded Sun Wukong’s words at every step and ignored Zhu Bajie’s, no demonic trials would have arisen, and the Western Paradise would have been reached effortlessly. Thus, Tan Zixiao’s *Huashu* states: \"Forget form to nurture *qi*, forget *qi* to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness—when emptiness and reality interpenetrate, great harmony is achieved.\" Xue Daoguang said: \"If one empties this illusory body, one directly receives the true teachings of the sacred master.\" The alchemical classics state: \"Disregard the body, and the body is cultivated; forget the form, and the form endures.\" All point to the emptiness outside the body as the most essential secret of the elixir method. The \"two true messages within and without the body\" are precisely this. Among ancient and modern alchemical texts, none elucidates the emptiness outside the body more subtly than *Journey to the West*. Sun Wukong styles himself \"Grandfather Sun of the Outside.\" Observe how Tang Sanzang encounters demonic trials the moment he parts from Wukong. Whenever Wukong departs, he draws a circle ○ on the ground, instructing Tang Sanzang and the others to remain within—stepping outside invites danger. This circle is Wukong’s mark, and to ensure readers grasp its meaning, he repeatedly demonstrates it in person, clarifying that the Dao of the elixir must operate in the emptiness outside from beginning to end, without the slightest intention or attachment to the body. The precautions in the elixir path against danger and peril are precisely to guard against the inability to abandon the body and to caution against the failure to forget form. If one forgets form and abandons the body at every step, entering natural emptiness like the Dark Warrior ascending from beneath the Abandoned-Body Cliff, what danger could remain? Moreover, whenever Wukong battles, he first addresses the demons: \"Do you know Grandfather Sun of the Outside?\" Yet these demons, obsessed with eating Tang Sanzang’s flesh to prolong life for ten thousand years (mocking those who cling to the physical form in their practice—opening passes, circulating *qi* and blood, and seeking immortality through posterior Heaven’s ascent and descent), fail to recognize him. Only the Nine-Headed Lion, after a moment’s reflection, smiles and says: \"So it is *him*. My great-grandson, you’ve provoked *him*.\" Repeating the word *him* twice, he grasps the emptiness outside the body—hence he is called the Ancestral Master (the Lion). \"Lion\" and \"Ancestral Master,\" \"Grandfather Sun of the Outside\" and \"external work\"—all are homophones, signifying that a true master must teach one to begin with the emptiness outside the body, enabling the return to the original source and union with the great Dao of the mysterious principle.\n\n---\n\n**Inner and Outer Medicines**\nThe *Wuzhen Pian*’s *Xijiang Yue* states:\n*\"The inner medicine resembles the outer,\nInner and outer must both communicate.\nThe elixir-head unites in like kind,\nWith two nurturing functions in harmony.\nWithin lies the natural true fire,\nThe furnace glows red with enduring flame.\nThe outer furnace’s waxing and waning demand diligent work—\nNothing surpasses the true seed in marvel.\"*\n\nThis is the origin of the names \"inner\" and \"outer\" medicines. Commentators have proposed various interpretations, leaving students increasingly bewildered. Here, I briefly expound their meaning: The inner medicine and inner communication pertain to the seventh return. Within the physical body, the solitary yang revives—this is the union of *kan* and *li*, dragon and tiger. It arises when body and mind are both still, and one senses the true yang *qi* from without, giving rise to the winter solstice’s yang birth—feeling the yang *qi* surging upward (*kan*’s true yang ascending, gold within water) and the heart’s fluids descending (*li*’s true yin descending, water within fire). The four images of water, fire, metal, and wood converge; the five phases gather; the three families (body, mind, and intent) meet—this is rightly called the inner medicine. The outer medicine and outer communication occur at the moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, when the prior-Heaven’s singular *qi* emerges from the formless, and my true emptiness resonates with its wondrous being. The alchemical classics call this the union of *qian* and *kun* at the zi-wu axis—this pertains to the ninth return.\n\nWithin the physical form, the spontaneous workings of non-action are called the principle of nature. Thus it is said: *\"Within, there is the celestial true fire, blazing crimson in the furnace.\"* This furnace refers to the inner furnace. As for the outer realm of emptiness, when mind and breath interdepend, one shifts from gentle fire to fierce fire, and from fierce fire back to gentle fire, advancing and retreating without missing the proper time, moving and stilling without disrupting the sequence—only then does the omen of *\"yellow skirts, primal auspice\"* appear. In this process, the slightest deviation in the firing times leads to a vast divergence. Hence it is said: *\"The outer furnace’s adjustments demand diligent effort.\"* This is the spontaneous workings of action and effort, called the cultivation of life. It is the profound mechanism of wondrous being.\n\nThe true seed refers to the singular *qi* of prior Heaven. The ancestral *qi* of prior Heaven gives rise to the myriad transformations, much like the seed of a plant. When alchemists obtain the singular *qi* of prior Heaven and congeal the elixir, this analogy is but a figurative expression. The practice is nothing other than the interdependence of mind and breath. Upon reaching the state of true emptiness and great samadhi, the inner and outer medicines both circulate. Externally, the nine returns occur, and the singular *qi* of prior Heaven arrives spontaneously; internally, the seven reversions take place, and the five phases and four images naturally converge. The three families meet of themselves, water and fire naturally achieve harmony, and all signs of efficacy arise unbidden, arriving unsought—possessing the marvel of water flowing to form a channel.\n\nThus *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *\"Only with utmost sincerity does the Dao follow naturally.\"* *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: *\"What is done by nature cannot be a devious path.\"* The oral instruction declares: The inner medicine circulates through the spontaneous workings of non-action and non-effort, produced by the union of *kan* and *li* (within the body as *kan* and *li*); the outer medicine circulates through the spontaneous workings of action and effort, born from the union of *qian* and *kun* (outside the body as *qian* and *kun*). The marvel of the alchemical method lies in non-action and non-effort, uniting with the wondrous being of true emptiness—this is the wondrous Dao of inner and outer harmony.\n\n---\n\n**Wu Earth and Ji Earth**\n\nSomeone asked: Alchemists speak of *wu* earth and *ji* earth. Refining *wu* earth yields the lead of the *kan* moon; refining *ji* earth yields the mercury of the *li* sun. When *wu* and *ji* unite to form the *daogui*, the four images of *kan*, *li*, dragon, and tiger intermingle and congeal the elixir. Yet this is spoken in terms of principle—how, in actual practice, are *wu* earth and *ji* earth distinguished? I beg you to clarify.\n\nThe answer: I once heard from Master Wang that the most essential aspect of the alchemical Dao is attaining the one touch of true emptiness. When one truly reaches the state of great samadhi and true emptiness, *wu* and *ji* earths naturally harmonize without need for arrangement. If we distinguish them, then: when verifying inner emptiness, one obtains *ji* earth—central emptiness and stillness, with not a thought arising, not an intention stirring, the five phases and four images converging of themselves. This is called the inner medicine, the seven reversions. When verifying outer emptiness, one obtains *wu* earth—the singular *qi* of prior Heaven arrives spontaneously. This is called the outer medicine, the nine returns. The singular *qi* of prior Heaven is termed the true seed. A seed must find true earth to sprout; the alchemical Dao is the same. Only when true emptiness manifests in the present moment does one possess this true earth, enabling the reception of the externally arriving true seed, thereby achieving the marvel of returning to the womb and re-creating *qian* and *kun*.\n\nThese *wu* and *ji* earths are the inner and outer mysterious passes, the inner and outer furnaces and cauldrons, the inner and outer matchmakers, accomplishing the work of the seven reversions and nine returns. *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The inner medicine is the same as the outer medicine; when the inner circulates, the outer must also circulate.\"* Know that upon reaching true emptiness, the inner and outer medicines both circulate, and the inner and outer earths naturally unite. Inner and outer merge indistinguishably, form and spirit fuse mysteriously—all alchemical methods spontaneously attain completion. Thus it is called the wondrous Dao of utmost simplicity and ease.\n\nI have often said that to grasp the ancient immortals’ alchemical methods, one need only contemplate the name and symbolic forms of Ancestor Lü. Ancestor Lü’s name is *Yan*, his courtesy name *Dongbin*, his Daoist name *Chunyang*; he called himself *Huiweng* and also *Wushan Daoren* or *Wukou Xiansheng*. Combining the characters *Lü* and *Yan* yields \"five mouths, one mountain.\" *Chunyang* refers to the prior-Heaven Dharmakaya; *Dongbin* refers to the posterior-Heaven physical form. It speaks of the four great elements as a temporary aggregation, a guest within the emptiness of the hollow, while the pure *qian* of emptiness is the true host. As *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"Though he acts as host, I remain the guest.\"* When practice reaches the state of great samadhi, inner and outer are both empty—thus inner and outer merge mysteriously, physical form and Dharmakaya interpenetrate and intertwine, neither one nor two, forming the symbol of the circle. This is why Ancestor Lü called himself *Huiweng*.\n\nThe three-character oral instruction says: *\"Mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.\"* This directly points to inner and outer both being empty—the symbolic form of the character *Lü*. When inner and outer unite as one, *wu* and *ji* merge, presenting the circular form of the character *hui*. In the *Yijing*, *gen* symbolizes the mountain, and the mountain means cessation. When body and mind are utterly still and unmoving, reaching great samadhi, then east three, south two, north one, and west four intermingle within the palace of *wu* and *ji*—this is the esoteric meaning of \"five mouths, one mountain.\" The symbolic form of *Yan* signifies body, mind, and intent standing unmoving like a mountain—this is the ultimate state of great samadhi.\n\n*The Pointers to the Nature and Life* states: *\"Gathering the three to return to the one lies in emptiness and stillness. Emptying the heart unites spirit with nature; stilling the body quiets essence and emotion; when intent reaches great samadhi, the three origins merge as one. Emotion uniting with nature is called metal and wood in harmony; essence uniting with spirit is called water and fire in communion; intent in great samadhi is called the five phases complete. Yet essence transforming into *qi* arises from the body’s immobility; *qi* transforming into spirit arises from the heart’s immobility...\"*\n\n\"Spirit transforming into emptiness arises from the intent’s immobility.\"\n\nThis passage explains that the great samadhi of body, heart, and intent forms the foundation of the Three Transformations in the Mysterious School, perfectly aligning with the symbolic form of *Yan* and faithfully preserving the orthodox transmission of Patriarch Qiu. Thus, the ancestral elixir formulas of the former masters regard the true emptiness of great samadhi as the paramount essential. Without attaining this state, neither inner nor outer medicine can circulate; neither the earth of *wu* (戊) nor the earth of *ji* (己) can be perceived; and the Five Phases and Four Images of water, fire, wood, and metal cannot coalesce.\n\n**116. Upper Closure and Lower Closure**\nThe *Cantong Qi*’s chapter *\"Knowing the White, Guarding the Black\"* states:\n*\"Upper closure is called ‘being’; lower closure is called ‘nonbeing.’\nNonbeing serves to uphold the upper; above dwells the virtue of spirit.\nThese two apertures follow the method—\nthe qi of metal also requires them.\"*\n\nThese lines are rather difficult to comprehend. In brief, they describe the harmonious fusion of heart and breath within the mysterious aperture, uniting above and below to merge obscurely at the center, where yin and yang wondrously conjoin and return to the primordial state before the Emperor of Images.\n\nHere, I cite the teachings of the Eastern and Western Patriarchs to fully elucidate their meaning.\n\n**Patriarch Lu’s *Qianxu* states:**\n*\"What is upper closure? Above is yang, Kan (坎), *wu* (戊), and emotion; below is yin, Li (離), *ji* (己), and nature. ‘Closure’ means not to release. Upper closure refers to the precelestial lead within Kan, whose signs have yet to emerge; lower closure refers to the long-accumulated postcelestial mercury within Li, firmly sealed and not released. Though its signs remain unmanifest, within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal—thus, upper closure is called ‘being.’ Internally nurturing the self in tranquil emptiness, lower closure is called ‘nonbeing.’ ‘Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper’: ‘serving’ implies reverent and meticulous devotion. ‘Above dwells the virtue of spirit’: the virtue of spirit, the true *qi* of Zhenyi (真乙), resides in the abode of Kan-*wu*. When it arrives, it is called ‘being,’ while ‘nonbeing’ watches over it with utmost care, receiving it with reverence, like a minister serving his lord, without the slightest error. Only then can one initially preserve nonbeing and guard being, and ultimately merge emotion with nature, completing the work of the active path.\"*\n\nThese two aspects constitute the method of the apertures’ functioning, a knowledge unattainable without a master. Laozi said: “Ever desiring, one observes its portals.” He also declared: “The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.” Zhongli Quan remarked: “The gate that gives me life, the door that takes my death.” All these describe a single aperture divided in two, what is termed “different names yet the same origin.” Within this aperture lies the mutual necessity of metal and *qi*, their sufficiency in mutual support. Knowing their interdependence, one may examine and seek it, reverently uphold and guard it.\n\nMaster Hanxu stated: “Above and below are Heaven and Earth. Closure is profound union. Nonbeing and being are the wondrous aperture. ‘Termed’ refers to naming and describing. One above, one below—both are concealed within this aperture. Whether being or nonbeing, all reside within this aperture. When one attains emptiness and guards stillness, at the moment Heaven and Earth profoundly unite, one may observe its wonder. The wondrous being of things cannot be named yet may be named—thus it is termed ‘being.’ This is what is meant by ‘Within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal.’ Observing its portal through nonbeing, the aperture of emptiness may be described yet cannot be described—thus it is termed ‘nonbeing.’ This is what is meant by ‘Within it there is something that returns to nothingness.’\n\n‘Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper’—this is not mere empty return, but the primordial true lead. It is what Laozi described as ‘the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, which one meets without seeing its head, follows without seeing its tail.’ In the elixir method, using nonbeing to uphold the upper is to transform nonbeing into being. What is meant by ‘upholding’? Who reverently upholds? Who mutually supports? When the virtue of spirit dwells in reverence, its *qi* naturally returns. Returning is upholding. The only fear is that above there be no virtue of spirit. ‘Above’ refers to the upper Yellow Court; ‘virtue’ refers to the virtue of humility. As the *Cantong Qi* states: ‘Reversion is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue.’ To attain emptiness, one employs the Dao; to seek lead, one employs virtue. Virtue is active, while the Dao is nonactive—this method must not be misunderstood.\n\nThe two apertures are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the place where the golden elixir transforms and takes form. When one knows the method of pursuit and absorption within the single aperture and two apertures, both gates open. Only then does metal return to nature, and it may be called the Reverted Elixir. Thus it is said: ‘Metal and *qi* are mutually necessary.’ ‘Mutually necessary’ refers to this method of absorption.”\n\nThe *Zhongzi Zhizhi* further states: “Revisiting the *Cantong Qi*: ‘Upper closure is called being; lower closure is called nonbeing.’ I humbly suggest that these ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ characters are both concealed within the character ‘middle.’ Yin and yang come and go within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between them, merging upper and lower into its midst. Thus, when the upper is closed and the lower is sealed, the mechanism is subtle and refined. Within the Great Void, the primordial *qi* operates alone—thus it is termed ‘nonbeing.’ This is also the purport of observing the wondrous. When the lower is closed and the upper is sealed, it remains hidden and unmanifest. Yet within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal—thus it is termed ‘being.’ This is also the purport of observing the aperture. Whether upper closure or lower closure, both return to the Mysterious Female. Desire and desirelessness all reside within the subtle and mysterious. Thus, the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass may be called the wondrous aperture of being and nonbeing, the upper and lower cauldrons, the yin-yang tripod, or the cavity of spirit and *qi*—all derive from this, all are encompassed within the one center.”\n\nI note that the *Cantong Qi* reveals the substance and function of the Mysterious Pass. In the previous section on the Mysterious Pass, it states: “Square and round, a span in diameter, blended and mutually supporting, born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and lofty”—this describes its substance. Here, it reveals its function. What is its function? It is the method of heart and breath interdependence, the purport of observing the wondrous aperture together. “Closure” is like double doors profoundly united, a casket and its lid in perfect accord—the heart is the wondrous emptiness, the breath is the wondrous being. “Above and below” are heart and breath. Uniting the heart with the breath is nonbeing becoming being—thus it is said: “Upper closure is called being.” Uniting the breath with the heart is being becoming nonbeing—thus it is said: “Lower closure is called nonbeing.” Drawing upper and lower into the center is the convergence of the Two Modes into the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThus, when heart and breath wondrously unite and congeal, the life and nature of the entire body merge, and the purport of returning to the root and restoring life is attained. At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, when the solitary yang returns, the time is spiritually known. One then employs the lower body to welcome it, not missing the stirring of the line. Like a host welcoming a guest who then takes the seat of honor, the host attends with utmost humility and deference—thus it is said: “Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper; above dwells the virtue of spirit.” The “virtue of spirit” refers to the primordial one *qi*. The ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens is spiritually wondrous and unfathomable, the convergence of all virtues—thus it is praised as the virtue of spirit.\n\nThe external and internal communication of the zi-wu work pertains to the fire times. This single aperture of the Mysterious Pass possesses the wonder of yin and yang opening and closing, movement and stillness mutually residing—thus it is called the “cavity of two apertures” or the “gate of wu-ji.” “Metal and *qi* are mutually necessary” means that the ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens must return through this. In sum, when spirit settles and *qi* returns, emptiness and being wondrously unite, and water and fire mutually assist. These several phrases in the *Cantong Qi* trace back to the ancient sage’s meaning in “Know the masculine, guard the feminine; know the white, guard the black; ever virtue does not depart, ever virtue does not err.” Only here “black and white” are changed to “upper and lower”—both are metaphors for the interdependence of heart and breath. As *Zhuangzi* said: “One below, one above, harmony as their measure.”\n\nThe aforementioned \"upper and lower\" likewise refer to the heart and breath. ¹¹⁷\n\n**Knowing Harmony and Knowing the Constant**\nThe essential principle of elixir methods lies in a single word: harmony. *Liezi* states: \"Harmony is the great sameness with all things.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"One below, one above, harmony as their measure.\" He also says: \"Virtue is harmony,\" and \"Virtue is the cultivation of harmony achieved\"; \"In the midst of silence, harmony alone is heard\"; \"He who understands virtue as the power of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, one who harmonizes with Heaven\"; \"Thus he regulates all under Heaven, harmonizing with others. One who harmonizes with others is called human joy; one who harmonizes with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.\" \"Embracing virtue and warming harmony, one thereby accords with all under Heaven.\" Guangchengzi says: \"I guard the One and thereby abide in harmony.\" The ancient sage says: \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with the qi of the void as their harmony.\" He also says: \"Knowing harmony is called the constant; knowing the constant is called clarity.\" \"Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness arises from Earth; blazing brightness arises from Heaven. The two intermingle and form harmony, and things are born therefrom.\"\n\nI say: harmony is the image of heart and breath in concord, yin and yang of the same kind following one another. When heart and breath depend upon one another, the yin and yang of my body intermingle and form harmony. Then, with the harmony of my body, I summon the harmony of Heaven and Earth. I unite with Heaven and Earth, and the harmony of Heaven and Earth becomes my harmony—thus I unite my virtue with that of Heaven and Earth. When heart and breath depend upon one another, spirit and qi both become still, and one is able to guard their true constancy. Stillness prolonged naturally settles; extreme settlement gives rise to clarity, and realm and wisdom interpenetrate. Thus knowing the constant is called clarity. Harmony, constancy, and clarity—these three are one. Yet the work has its proper sequence and cannot be rushed. *The Scripture of the Five Kitchens* says: \"When the qi is harmonized with the Great Harmony, attaining the One, the Dao is everywhere at peace.\" *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: \"When there is harmony, there is following.\" It also says: \"Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating at the proper time. Each attains its harmony, and all emit confirming signs.\" Master Qianxu says: \"The word 'harmony' is most apt and incisive.\" He also says: \"When the medicine arises, it is called the tally; when the medicine is completed, it is called the confirmation—both arise from harmonious qi.\" *The Seal* says: \"When there is harmony, there is following; the path is level and not deviant.\" Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor: \"I guard the One and thereby abide in harmony.\" Now, the immortal elders model themselves on the sun and moon, balancing water and fire, and conclude with the single word \"harmony\"—profound and subtle indeed! It also says: \"Abiding in harmony is harmonizing the sequence of yin and yang qi.\" *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: \"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.\" It also says: \"Observe and examine with careful diligence; scrutinize and regulate cold and warmth.\" This is abiding in harmony. Harmony is what the elixir masters call \"fire timing.\" I note that the character for \"elixir\" (*dan*) is an image of the sun and moon in harmony—thus from beginning to end, harmony is its function. Heart and breath merging in darkness is harmony; Kan and Li intermingling is harmony; Qian and Kun uniting is harmony. *The Emerald Writ* says: \"When spirit and qi merge in darkness and qi returns, bones and flesh fuse in harmony, and one knows nothing of it.\" *The Heart Seal Scripture* says: \"When the Great Harmony fills and overflows, the bones scatter like cold jade.\" The wondrous function of harmony is evident. Thus knowing harmony is the essential element of long life and enduring vision. Therefore, one who can attain harmony can also attain constancy. Constancy is true constancy. *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says: \"The true constant responds to things; the true constant attains nature.\" It also says: \"The Dao of true constancy is attained by those who awaken; those who awaken to the Dao are perpetually pure and still.\" From this, one may know that true constancy is the numinous clarity of one’s original nature. The numinous clarity of original nature is one’s true self, enduring through kalpas without destruction—thus it is so named. ¹¹⁸\n\n**Knowing the Masculine and Guarding the Feminine**\nThe ancient sage says: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be the valley of all under Heaven. Being the valley of all under Heaven, ever virtue does not depart, and one returns to the state of an infant.\" The so-called masculine and feminine refer approximately to heart and breath, spirit and qi. Knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine means uniting spirit with breath, causing nature and life to return to the One—this is returning from the Two Modes to the Supreme Ultimate. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and true yang naturally arrives. Stirring the wind of Xun to respond to it, one breaks through the passes and ascends to the crown—like the waters of the Yellow River surging and reversing upward, which the elixir classics call the \"River Chariot.\" Patriarch Lü says: \"White clouds ascend to the upper palace; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\" Longmeizi says: \"Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand things; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.\" Wei Boyang says: \"Cultivate without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain. Dripping like spring moisture, flowing like melting ice. From the head it flows to the feet, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless cavern, gently pervading the space within.\" The image of being \"the valley of all under Heaven\" is truly like this. From this, the prior and posterior heavens naturally fuse in harmony, not departing from true emptiness, while qi is full and spirit is tranquil—without thought, without worry, the three minds are all extinguished, the four forms forgotten, in a state of primal chaos, returning to the state of an infant—this is called \"returning to youth.\" Its wondrous subtlety lies in knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine. Master Hanxu’s *Eastern Clarification of the Right* further sets forth two principles to elucidate the meaning of this chapter: first, the masculine acts and the feminine transforms; second, the masculine returns and the feminine conceals. When the feminine and masculine interact, metal is hidden within water, and water in turn gives birth to metal.\n\nWhen metal qi is full, the tidal surge arrives—its force like that of a canal stream, flowing backward and surging upward. This is the water of the world’s canal streams. The *Cantong Qi* states: “The masculine Yang scatters the mysterious, the feminine Yin governs the yellow transformation.” Herein lies one meaning of “knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine.”\n\nFurthermore, if we discuss the principle of generating things, when Yin reaches its extreme, Yang arises—this is the feminine harboring the masculine. If we discuss the matter of nurturing things, when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises—this is the masculine harboring the feminine. The masculine harboring the feminine means that, having obtained the return of the masculine to form the elixir, one must further rely on the feminine’s concealment to warm the elixir. Its force is like that of mountain streams, flowing from above and pouring downward into the valley. Thus, the Way of guarding the feminine is like the world’s streams and valleys—flowing and returning, returning to the valley, just as it returns to the Yellow Court, and again to the state of an infant, entering stillness to nurture the sacred embryo. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “The masculine harboring the feminine knits the sacred embryo.” Herein lies another meaning of “knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine.”\n\nThese two principles expound the profound classics’ essential teachings, elucidating them with depth and clarity, revealing what predecessors had not. Yet, in terms of practice, they are merely transformations within the interdependence of heart and breath. The first principle reveals the gathering of the primordial Yang within the brightness of the moon—spirit and breath intermingling to summon the return of the single Yang. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram, where water gives birth to metal, signifying the return of the single Yang. The second principle reveals the warming and nurturing: when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to the *Gou* hexagram. After obtaining the elixir, one circulates it with the fire of spirit, ensuring that spirit and qi remain inseparable, until spirit and qi transform together and the embryo is perfected. Within movement lies stillness, thus fulfilling the work of nurturing the embryo. Within stillness, movement returns, thus arousing the generation of primordial Yang. By alternating movement and stillness, the Dao of the elixir is complete. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “From *Fu* and *Gou* one can henceforth apply the work—who says the golden elixir cannot be achieved?” How profound these words are!\n\n---\n\n119. Knowing the White and Guarding the Black\nThe Old Sage said: “Know the white, guard the black—this is the model for the world. As the model for the world, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the ultimate of the Dao, its number named One.” Lu Xixing said: “The so-called numinous brightness is the power of spirit. The white is the essence of metal, which is the qi of metal. Among the five phases’ qi, metal can generate water. Yet in the creation of the returned elixir, the primordial white metal is born within the water of Kan. Thus, those who refine the elixir must empty the heart and humble the self, reverently seeking lead from Kan. When the time arrives and the mechanism moves, the numinous brightness will come of itself—then ‘suddenly, in the dead of night, a single thunderclap opens ten thousand doors in sequence,’ and the wondrous interplay of mutual necessity appears.” Master Hanxu said: “The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water.”\n\nThe metal essence arises when yang, the male, sows its seed within the female and is born. Before this essence came to be, the body of Mother Kun was originally empty. Through the mingling of her light with Father Qian’s radiance, Kun became replete and formed Kan. Once the form of Kan was complete, the moon emitted its light from the direction of Dui—this is called the metal within water. The metal within water truly relies on Mother Kun’s nurturing to take form, and so it is called the mother qi. As *The Awakening to Reality* says, “Extracting the white from the black becomes the elixir mother.” The mother qi possesses a white light, known as the yang light. When the yang light appears, one circulates one’s own mercury to welcome it—this is what is meant by “seeking the medicine in the second phase.” When the two correspond, the two eights of the same kind are captured in the same moment, refined into the yang elixir, which is the elixir mother. Yet because its transformation occurs externally, the elixir mother is only considered the outer medicine. The practitioner refines the inner medicine with the outer medicine, subduing the child qi with the mother qi. Within the elixir mother, yang lead is then produced, which is transported by the river chariot, returned in reverse to the original palace, and concealed within the earthen crucible. After the four phases harmonize and the three natures unite in joy, this moment of bliss attains longevity. Though the method of practice is thus, to know the white one must first guard the black; only by guarding the black can one know the white. Yet even after knowing the white, one must still guard the black—within this lies a threefold wondrous function, which serves as the world’s model and standard. If one can practice accordingly, the constant virtue of the natural order will not err, and without error, one may return to verify the limitless, refining the spirit to restore the void.\n\nTo know the white one must first guard the black is yang entering within yin. To guard the black and thereby know the white is yin giving birth to yang. To know the white and yet still guard the black is the spirit returning and qi submitting. The principle of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is all thus—hence it is the world’s model and standard.\n\nXuanjing said: The Eastern and Western Patriarchs have elucidated the essence of the Golden Elixir with utmost clarity and precision. Yet what they revealed pertains primarily to the principles and subtleties of the practice. In terms of actual cultivation, it is nothing other than the wondrous union of mind and breath, where stillness gives birth to yang, true emptiness resonates with wondrous being, and wondrous being in turn merges with true emptiness. Spirit and breath harmonize, nature and life become one, coalescing into a single whole to form the embryo of the Dao.\n\nBlack and white are but symbolic terms, referring to yin and yang, and ultimately to the body, mind, spirit, and qi. At the outset, the spirit governs qi, and the breath’s ebb and flow may be faintly perceived externally. One must neither fixate on it nor be entirely without awareness. I simply allow it to exist naturally, then forget it naturally, gradually dissolving into profound obscurity and entering the state of harmonious equilibrium. At the initial union of yin and yang, beauty resides within—this is the foundational work of \"knowing the white by first guarding the black.\"\n\nWhen spirit and breath stabilize externally, the outer breath ceases, the sun and moon conjoin like jade disks, and one stands at the threshold of *bo* and *fu*, between the dark of the moon and the new moon. At this moment, one enters the third stage of *Huozi’s* \"Realm of Earth,\" a state of utter stillness and immobility. Yet having returned to pure *kun*, with inner and outer both stilled and thoughts and breath dissolved, forming the symbol ○ (internally as *ji* earth, externally as *wu* earth), the pure *qian* of the void must respond and arrive. The first stirring of yang arises, and when the time comes, the spirit knows—this is the natural correspondence of the wondrous tally. In an instant of awakening, one departs from the physical body, and the mind and breath depend on each other externally (for I originally have no breath; only when the spirit moves does qi move, thus transforming into breath). This is what is meant by \"arousing the *xun* wind, moving the *kun* fire, lightly lifting, silently circulating\"—the second stage of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\"\n\nAs spirit and breath gradually harmonize and merge, one enters true stillness once more. At this point, inner and outer are entirely forgotten, mind and environment both stilled, self and dharma both forgotten, returning to the limitless. The primordial true yang thus evoked will not escape, \"sent back to the earthen cauldron and sealed securely.\" This is the third stage of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\"\n\nThe practitioner must understand that the elixir method must not cling even slightly to the physical body. Clinging leads to leakage of essence and loss of the elixir, giving rise to countless faults. One must enter the state of primordial chaos, return to the limitless, like a living corpse, forgetting even this state of stillness. Where there is no \"no,\" only profound tranquility remains—then qi congeals and the elixir gathers, and the transformations of the six dragons are complete. From the initial step of refining essence into qi to the final stage of refining spirit to return to the void, merging with the Dao in forgetfulness, the process is consistently thus. Therefore, the enlightened find it simple and easy, while the deluded make it increasingly complex and difficult.\n\nThe supreme elixir method takes true emptiness as the guiding principle of practice. The longer one abides in the great stillness of true emptiness, the swifter the effects. When, throughout the twelve hours of the day, not a moment passes without being in this great stillness—so that one cannot even find the breath—then naturally the embryo matures and the spirit emerges (the dharmakāya separates from the physical body).\n\nThe above speaks specifically of the practice, revealing the true oral instructions of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\" Initially, yang enters within yin (concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, the sun moving into the moon’s brightness) to seek lead—this is what Patriarch Li meant by \"to know the white, one must first guard the black.\" In the middle stage, yang is born within yin, stillness giving way to movement—this is \"by guarding the black, one can know the white.\" Finally, the spirit returns and qi submits, wondrously entering the realm of great stillness, the state of profound tranquility, where prior and posterior heaven naturally harmonize. Gradually gathering and congealing, the elixir forms—this is \"knowing the white and yet still guarding the black.\"\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold the master’s power.\" Day and night signify movement and stillness. The \"master\" is the host of qi, and \"power\" is the function of the spirit. Refining with literary fire and forging with martial heat, ceasing the fire and nurturing with warmth—only after three returns is the work complete. This aligns with the principles expounded by Patriarch Hanxu. Is this not the profound mechanism of returning to life and the bridge to returning to the origin?\n\n---\n\nThe Old Sage said: \"There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and unchanging, circulating without end. It may be called the Mother of all under heaven. I know not its name; I style it the Dao.\"\n\nThe commentary states: The virtue of this formless completion is the ocean of perfect enlightenment. In movement, it becomes the true unity of qi, the foundation of the Daoist practice of fulfilling destiny. In stillness, it pervades and contains all, becoming the Tathāgata-garbha, the wondrous true suchness of mind—the foundation of the Buddhist practice of cultivating nature. Before movement and stillness divide, nature and life return to one. This is the primordial, utterly true body, empty, silent, vast, and pure, pervading all without a name—hence it is forcibly called the Dao. All transcendent dharmas arise from it, and all worldly dharmas are established by it; thus, it is also called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nMaster Fu said:\n*\"There is a thing before heaven and earth,\nFormless, originally silent and void.\nIt can be the master of all phenomena,\nUnchanging through the four seasons.\"*\n\nHis meaning is the same as the Old Sage’s.\n\nThe *Daode Jing* further states: \"All people have their means; I alone am dull and coarse. I alone differ from others in valuing the nourishment of the Mother.\" It also says: \"The world has a beginning, which may be regarded as the Mother of the world. Having attained the Mother, one knows her children. Having known the children, one returns to guard the Mother. Thus, one does not perish even in death.\" This teaching of nourishing and guarding the Mother is the essence revered by the profound tradition, the constant practice of Daoists, and the key to returning and restoration.\n\nTo \"nourish the Mother\" means to seek sustenance from the Mother—this is the interdependence of heart and breath, achieving a state of profound obscurity, emptiness, and primordial chaos. Externally, one draws in the primordial unified *qi*, which steeps, irrigates, and nurtures both the Dharma-body and the physical form. Thus, one’s original *qi* grows daily more abundant, true nature is daily restored, the foundation of life is eternally firm, and the nature-body becomes perfectly luminous. This is the essential meaning of nourishing the Mother.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*\"The loving mother nurtures,\nThe filial son repays her grace.\nThus they clasp and swallow,\nChewing and merging as one.\"*\nThis is precisely the Way.\n\nAfter obtaining the Elixir, embracing the Origin and guarding the One, quietly nurturing the Dao-embryo—this is called \"guarding the Mother.\" To guard means to warm and nourish with gentle fire. Guarding the Mother is the work of nurturing the embryo, while nourishing the Mother is the effort of gathering and refining. By nourishing the Mother and then guarding her, the tasks of warming, nurturing, gathering, and refining are complete.\n\nMaster Hanxu said:\n*\"When yang lead serves as the Mother,\nyin mercury becomes the Child.\nYin mercury is the postnatal child-*qi*,\nyang lead is the prenatal Mother-*qi*.\nUsing external yang lead to subdue internal yin mercury—\nwhen Mother and Child meet, this is called 'knowing the Child.'\nYet for this yang lead to arrive, the marvelous function of fire is required.\nFor lead is born in the Kan palace, sinking and unmoving;\nto restrain the true mercury of the Li palace,\none must first employ fierce fire for intense refinement,\nonly then will it ascend and soar.\nOnce it meets true mercury,\none should guard the city and bathe—\nno further fierce fire may be applied.\nAt first, the Mother comes longing for the Child;\nlater, the Child lingers longing for the Mother.\nThus it is said: 'Having known the Child, one returns to guard the Mother.'\nWhen Mother and Child long for each other without cease,\nthe Great Elixir is accomplished.\"*\n\nMaster Qianxu said:\n*\"The teaching of guarding the Mother is also called nourishing the Mother—its meaning is most profound. The sages of the Three Teachings share this vital thread. Our Confucians inherit it as the transmission of 'refining the One'...\"*\n\nThe Buddhists attain it and open the Gate of Non-Duality; the Daoist sages attain it and cultivate the study of Embracing the One. For this is the Way.\n\nWhat is meant by \"guarding the Mother\"? To seal the Dui, close the gate—this is guarding the Mother. To perceive the small as yielding—this is guarding the Mother. To use one’s light and return to clarity—this is guarding the Mother. The study of guarding the Mother is the profound mechanism of returning to life. One who can return to life may then inherit the Dao and merge with its truth.\n\n---\n\n**Embracing the One and Attaining the One**\nThe Daoist sages say: *\"The sage embraces the One as the model for all under heaven.\"* They also say: *\"Of old, those who attained the One: Heaven attained the One and became clear; Earth attained the One and became tranquil; spirits attained the One and became numinous; valleys attained the One and became full; the myriad things attained the One and came to life; lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven—all these arose from the One.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"When one is permeated by the One, the myriad affairs are complete.\"* Baopuzi said: *\"The Dao arises from the One, and its value is peerless. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard. When preserved, it is present; when neglected, it vanishes. Facing it brings fortune; turning from it brings misfortune. Safeguarding it ensures boundless blessings; losing it leads to withered form and exhausted qi.\"* Laozi said: *\"Vague and indistinct, yet within it are images; indistinct and vague, yet within it are things.\"* This refers to the One.\n\nThus, the immortal classics say: *\"If you desire long life, guard the One with clarity. When hungry, the One provides sustenance; when thirsty, the One offers drink. The One can generate yin and engender yang, regulate the cycles of cold and heat. Spring attains the One and sprouts; summer attains the One and grows; autumn attains the One and harvests; winter attains the One and stores. Its vastness cannot be measured by the six directions; its minuteness cannot be compared to a hair’s tip.\"*\n\nMaster Bai said: *\"This is the true qi of the One, prior to the ten thousand images, the Great Void, the Great Non-Being, the Great Emptiness, the Great Origin. Dim and obscure, it cannot be measured by inches; vast and boundless, it cannot be fathomed by shores. Its greatness has no exterior; its smallness has no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the tip of a hair. Above, it transcends color; below, it transcends depth. One thing, perfectly complete, manifesting through the ages. That which cannot be named, the sages grasp with their hearts, and out of necessity call it the Dao.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"To concentrate qi and attain suppleness, to contain light and remain silent, to nurture correctness and maintain fullness, to guard the feminine and embrace the One—with the mind unmoving, the myriad conditions grow still. Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures are not equal to guarding the One. Guard the One, and the myriad methods return to the One. Attain the One, and one transcends the posterior heaven to avoid death; lose the One, and one decays with things. Build with the One as the foundation, gather with the One as the medicine, refine with the One as the fire, congeal with the One as the elixir, nurture with the One as the sacred embryo, circulate with the One as the withdrawal and replenishment, sustain with the One as the sealing, and purify with the One as the bathing.\"*\n\nMaster Xuanjing said: *\"The so-called One is the qi of wondrous existence, called the primordial ancestral qi, also known as the true qi of the One. When speaking of qi, it is in terms of its circulation; when speaking of spirit, it is in terms of its numinosity; when speaking of essence, it is in terms of its coagulation. In reality, it is one thing.\"*\n\nThe Daoist tradition attains the One to achieve truth; the Confucian tradition attains the One to participate in transformation; the Chan tradition attains the One to illuminate the mind. Thus, the Three Teachings all value attaining the One. After attaining it, one guards it like a hen brooding over an egg, like a dragon nurturing a pearl—this is called \"embracing the One,\" the work of ten months of gestation. Attaining the One is the effect of congealing the elixir. One attains it in stillness; one embraces it in quiescence. With body and mind profoundly settled, the effects manifest naturally.\n\nMaster Bai said: *\"From emptiness and spontaneity, being arises from non-being. The ten thousand things are one thing, and the one is most precious to guard. The whirling wind merges, and the whole day feels like intoxication. The great dream awakens, thunder roars and lightning flashes. Clouds disperse and rain scatters—heaven endures and earth abides.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Like a dragon nurturing a pearl, the heart does not forget; like a hen brooding over an egg, the qi does not cease. It is like the autumn cicada drinking the morning breeze, or the aged oyster containing the autumn moon.\"*\n\nThe subtlety of embracing the One is most thoroughly expounded by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Forgetting the One and Transcending the One**\nZhuangzi said: *\"Act without the One.\"* He also said: *\"As if forgetting the One, as if losing the One—such a one transcends the mundane, leaving no trace.\"* Master Bai said: *\"From the One to the One, the One reaches its ultimate. This is called shedding the embryo, reaching the limit of the limitless. The One unites with nothing, merging with the Dao in truth, enduring with heaven—this is called the true One.\"*\n\nCao Wenyu said: *\"Merge and become one, then forget the One—thus may one emerge and submerge with primordial transformation.\"*\n\nNow, to concentrate spirit and guard qi, to attain the One and embrace the One—these principles have already been set forth by the Daoist sages. Here, we reveal the principle of forgetting the One: to dissolve the heart that embraces the One, shattering emptiness, breaking through to the other shore of the Thunderous Sound. Then, one cannot be confined or called back, transcending the ken of saints and mortals, attaining freedom and ease. The Chan tradition calls this \"turning the position.\"\n\nThus, attaining the One can clarify the affairs of the Dharma-body; forgetting the One can clarify the supreme matters of the Dharma-body. In the Daoist tradition’s cultivation and realization, one must pass through this barrier to reach the field of great rest and great liberation. Otherwise, if there is still something embraced or guarded, one will never erase all traces and enter the gate of perfect penetration.\n\n---\n\n**The Minor Return and the Great Return**\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"When metal comes to return to the original nature, it may then be called the Returned Elixir.\" Yet in recent times, alchemists have further distinguished between the Lesser Return Elixir and the Greater Return Elixir. The *Strange Encounters at Sea and Mountain* records that Li Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, obtained the Lesser Return Elixir and lived for several centuries without his appearance aging. When the Patriarch Lü encountered him in Jurong, he taught him to refine the Golden Fluid Greater Return Elixir. The old man joyfully received the instruction. The Patriarch Lü said: \"Reset the furnace, reestablish the crucible, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm.\" This precisely refers to the Greater Return.\n\nWhere, then, lies the distinction between the Greater and Lesser Returns? Explanations among authors have varied, but following the transmitted teachings, we here elucidate their meaning: Since the breaking of the original body, the postnatal Kan and Li have taken charge. The practitioner begins with the interdependence of heart and breath, progressing until the ordinary breath ceases entirely, body and mind enter profound stillness, and inner and outer become utterly quiescent. Thereupon, the primordial One Qi emerges from the midst of emptiness, and the work of gathering and absorbing begins. Thus, my pure yin responds to its pure yang, returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. Each time the work is performed, the prenatal true yang arrives once, returning from without to within the body. Hence the *Cantong Qi* says: \"When metal comes to return to the original nature, it may then be called the Returned Elixir.\"\n\nAs the work advances, true yang gathers ever more, until qi is full and the fire is withdrawn, forming the Returned Elixir—this is called the Lesser Return. The Lesser Return is the initial return, wherein yin responds to yang, corresponding to the *Yijing*’s *Tai* hexagram: \"The small departs, the great arrives.\" This stage of the work is termed \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\" in alchemical texts. When true qi is fully abundant and the Li palace is filled, the Qian body is restored—this is called \"returning to youth\" in alchemical texts.\n\nAfter returning to youth, the inner being is purely Qian. The practitioner then enters samadhi and true stillness, using one’s Qian yang to respond to the primordial Qian yang true qi, merging the inner and outer layers of the prenatal to produce the Great Medicine—this is called the Great Elixir, or the Greater Return. It is the work of the seven-day Great Celestial Circuit. The Greater Return embodies the image of double Qian. The Patriarch Lü’s poem on obtaining the Greater Return Elixir says: \"Refining and refining until reaching Qian Qian, only then is one a drunken immortal among men.\" This serves as proof. The *Yijing* states: \"All day long Qian Qian, returning and repeating the Dao.\" The image of Qian Qian is the esoteric principle of the Greater Return. \"Returning and repeating\" means returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, then from the prenatal to that which precedes the prenatal. Only upon reaching the realm of double Qian are the transformations of the six dragons complete, and one may then govern and command Heaven.\n\nThus, in the alchemical method, when the postnatal responds to the prenatal, the medicine obtained is called the Lesser Medicine, the elixir formed is called the Lesser Elixir, and the celestial circuit performed is called the Lesser Celestial Circuit. When one’s prenatal pure yang responds to the prenatal pure yang, merging the inner and outer layers of the prenatal, the medicine obtained is called the Great Medicine, the elixir formed is called the Great Elixir, and the celestial circuit performed is called the Great Celestial Circuit. The *Yijing*’s Lesser Accumulation and Greater Accumulation, and the Dao’s Lesser Return and Greater Return, share the same meaning. Though divided into greater and lesser, the progress of the work fundamentally does not depart from the interdependence of heart and breath. Once true emptiness and great stillness are attained, inner and outer harmonize and merge. The Lesser Celestial Circuit proceeds within stillness, and the Great Celestial Circuit likewise proceeds within stillness. The Lesser Return Elixir forms within stillness, and the Greater Return Elixir likewise forms within stillness. Only the depth of stillness differs, hence the results vary.\n\nFurthermore, after the Lesser Return Elixir is formed, one must apply the fire of nurturing the elixir, allowing it to mature fully and perform the Great Celestial Circuit, obtaining the Great Medicine and completing the Greater Return. After the Great Elixir is formed, one must apply the fire of nurturing the embryo, enduring for ten months until the embryo is fully developed and the birth occurs—this is called \"emerging as spirit.\" Beyond this lie further practices of tempering and nourishing, called \"nursing.\" At this point, the great work of becoming an immortal is complete.\n\n---\n\nLaozi said: \"Much speech hastens exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Riding things to roam the heart, entrusting to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection.\" Abiding in the center and nurturing the center share the same meaning. Master Chongxu said: \"The center is not the center of the middle; it is the center of emptiness and void. Abiding is not clinging and guarding; it is the abiding of utmost emptiness.\" When the practitioner unites heart and breath at the center of emptiness outside the body, this is the study of abiding in the center. From the union of heart and breath, nature and life return to the origin, congealing into the embryo of the Dao. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Managing and nurturing the calyx, congealing spirit to form the body.\" It also says: \"The three luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the pearl of the child.\" This is the work of nurturing the center.\n\nTo speak plainly: the original spirit and original qi circulate within emptiness. The original spirit, nourished by the original qi, becomes ever more luminous and yang, ultimately transcending the embryo to manifest as a perfected being. Thus, the union of heart and breath in emptiness is called abiding in the center. The blending of spirit and qi in emptiness into a single whole is called nurturing the center. Master Chongxu said: \"One who preserves the substance of the center does not abide in a single thought, remaining utterly still, abiding until food and pulse both cease, sleep and dullness vanish entirely, yet never departing from stillness for even a moment. One who exhausts the function of the center keeps the numinous light unobscured, utterly transcending the roots of the dust.\"\n\n\"Guard until the two qi both vanish, thoughts arise and cease no more, yet never for even a moment depart from illumination.\"\n\nMaster Hanxu said: \"The wondrous realm of the center naturally nurtures the self by congealing spirit. Entering the chamber to return the elixir, and even transcending the embryo to manifest as a perfected being—all depend on this. Thus, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this center, for it is the path to advancement. In ancient times, Lord Wen Shi asked the Most High: ‘What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the Dao?’ The Most High replied: ‘It lies in deep roots and firm stems, in guarding the center and embracing the One.’\"\n\nI say: When spirit and qi unite in emptiness, then guarding the center and nurturing the center are threaded as one.\n\n---\n\n**125. Nurturing the Elixir and Nurturing the Embryo**\n\nThe alchemical practice of *wenyang* (warm nurturing) truly comprises two stages: nurturing the elixir and nurturing the embryo. When refining essence to transform qi is complete, one ceases the fire to prevent leakage of qi. When the cessation of fire takes effect, the result is the formation of the elixir. At the initial formation of the elixir, gazing steadily beneath lamplight, a black dot appears before the eyes—unseen in daylight. Upon seeing this dot, one knows the elixir has formed and must then apply the fire of warm nurturing to cultivate it. The black dot before the eyes gradually turns red and yellow, until it appears golden when viewed in sunlight, signaling the completion of the Lesser Return Elixir.\n\n*The Marvelous Encounter at Sea Mountain* records that Li Qi, the recluse of Huayang, obtained the Lesser Return Elixir and lived for several centuries without aging. When Ancestor Lü traveled to Jurong, he encountered Li in the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven—this was the Lesser Return Elixir. The fire phases for nurturing this elixir have been transmitted orally from sage to sage and are not recorded in books; this compilation makes no exception. For this work’s purpose is only to reveal the initial steps for prolonging life and enhancing vitality. The most profound oral secrets, not practicable by all, remain unrecorded.\n\nOnce the Lesser Return Elixir is fully nurtured, one proceeds to the Greater Celestial Cycle, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood. This Greater Celestial Cycle also involves three fire phases, transmitted orally and not committed to writing. After practicing the Greater Celestial Cycle for an appropriate period, there is a seven-day process of passing through the Greater Celestial Cycle, yielding the Great Medicine and achieving the Greater Return. Following the Greater Celestial Cycle comes the ten-month practice of nurturing the embryo—the second stage of warm nurturing. When the great samādhi is perfected and spirit is whole, one emerges as spirit.\n\nThus, the first stage of warm nurturing, which matures the elixir, pertains to the Lesser Return and produces earthbound immortals. When a practitioner’s work reaches the stage of elixir formation, even if they encounter calamity and die, their single spirit remains sovereign, allowing them to freely choose rebirth or seize another’s body—far surpassing ordinary people.\n\n---\n\n**126. Facing the Origin and Returning to the Origin**\n\nLongmei Zi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* discusses *chaoyuan* (facing the origin):\n\n> \"When form and spirit are both wondrous, the Dao is their companion;\n> Cultivating both nature and life, they merge with the Great Void.\n> When the imperial edict descends, one mounts a crane in flight;\n> After receiving the jade script, one rides a dragon chariot.\n> The glory of immortal officials is debated in terms of rank,\n> While the turbid world’s trials are escaped to dwell in peace.\n> Through accumulated virtue and diligent seeking, all may attain;\n> Why then do you alone hesitate?\"\n\nIt also discusses *huanyuan* (returning to the origin):\n\n> \"Not south, nor east—where is it?\n> The wondrous single spirit is originally unobstructed.\n> The worthy and foolish are fundamentally without distinction;\n> The mundane and sacred have never differed.\n> Reddening cinnabar through repetition becomes habit;\n> Calling ‘mother’ instead of ‘mama’ is but a skillful means.\n> All conditioned things are unreal—\n> Awaken to the true source, where emptiness is not empty.\"\n\nXuanjing said: *Chaoyuan* confers immortal office, whether ascending in broad daylight or lifting one’s dwelling to soar—akin to passing the imperial examination and receiving an official post. The final step, the emptying of the heart to pass the ultimate test, is the pinnacle of Dao cultivation, where function is exhausted and effort forgotten. Within the ever-quiescent light, there is no attachment or hindrance—what then matters the presence or absence of an imperial edict? Thus, the Mysterious School values *huanyuan* above *chaoyuan*.\n\n---\n\n**127. The Greater Yang and the Greater Yin**\n\nLiu Wuyuan’s *Women’s Elixir Formula* states: \"The Greater Yang refines qi—this is the principle for men; the Greater Yin refines form—this is the expedient for women.\"\n\nMy teacher once remarked that these two lines dispel millennia of doubts and greatly benefit the *Women’s Elixir Formula*. Since ancient times, it has been held that men refine qi while women refine form, with different starting points. This has led heterodox schools to seize upon it as justification, creating separate methods for the Greater Yang refining qi and the Greater Yin refining form. Little do they realize this refers to the postnatal realm; in the prenatal Great Dao, men and women begin without distinction.\n\nMy teacher said: \"The so-called Greater Yang refining qi means heart and breath depend on each other externally, so the heart becomes empty. When the heart is empty, the heart-fire naturally descends, and the water of the lower *kan* transforms into qi and ascends—this is the harmonization of *kan* and *li*. It is like sunlight shining down, causing seawater to transform into qi and rise. The Greater Yang refining qi is nothing more than this principle.\n\nThe phrase ‘Greater Yin refining form’ arises because the sun, residing in the *li* position, is inverted to become female—internally yin, externally yang. The internal yin is real; the external yang is illusory. In sum, the Greater Yin is a metaphor for the heart; *form* refers to the body. The ancients spoke of *form and spirit*, or *body and heart*—all ultimately reducible to the two words *yin* and *yang*. The body is qi. Refining qi with the heart is, in reality, the interdependence of heart and breath—identical to the previous line, differing only in wording.\n\nWuyuan saw through this principle, hence calling it an expedient, not an actual event, though the phenomenon exists. To pierce this with a single word requires one who is truly cultivated.\"\n\nThe above explanation by Master Wang is exceedingly precise. The entire elixir method emphasizes practice in the emptiness beyond the body—there is truly no difference between men and women.\n\nYet because post-heaven physiology differs, the physical body’s responses vary accordingly. In quiescence, when yang arises, men manifest as external yang stirring, while women manifest as both breasts becoming firm. Upon the completion of foundational work, men’s essence-gate seals itself, and their external yang retracts like that of a child; women’s menstrual cycles cease, and their breasts recede into the chest. Yet when it comes to the work of settled forgetting, there is no distinction between men and women.\n\n**128. Attaining Life and Forgetting Life**\nZhuangzi speaks of *attaining life* and *forgetting life*. Let us now elucidate their meanings: *Attaining life* means comprehending the principles of life and nurturing it. *Forgetting life* means emptying body and heart, becoming oblivious to them in the Dao.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Attaining Life” chapter states: “Those who attain the essence of life do not pursue what is of no use to life.” It further says: “When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. When form and essence are unharmed, this is called *shifting*. Refining essence to ever greater refinement is to return and assist Heaven.” It also cites Master Guan Yin: “He dwells in the measure of non-excess, abides in the boundless axis, and roams through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Unifying his nature, nurturing his qi, harmonizing his virtue, he communicates with the source of all things. One who does so preserves the wholeness of Heaven, his spirit unobstructed—how could external things intrude?”\n\nExplanation: The essence of *attaining life* lies in nurturing qi and storing spirit; the practice is precisely the interdependence of heart and breath. When spirit congeals and essence is restored, true qi surges boundlessly, flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth. Thus one harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth, hence the phrase “harmonizing his virtue.” The root of human life lies in true breath. Therefore, regulating the breath to stillness so as to connect with Heaven and Earth’s true yang is the essential element of nurturing life. Only after *attaining life* can one nurture life.\n\nMaster Lü says: “Exhaustively trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth—marvel not that the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.” Master Zi Yang says: “I urge you to exhaustively trace back to the origin of your birth; returning to the root is the Medicine King.” This, too, is the essence of *attaining life*.\n\nAs for *forgetting life*, the practice deepens, body and heart enter stillness, inner and outer both empty, and one realizes the wondrousness of the emptiness of self. The Yellow Emperor says: “When spirit enters its gate, bones and skeleton return to their root—what ‘I’ remains?” The Old Sage says: “Return to the state of no-thing, return to the state of the limitless.” Both express the wondrous purport of *forgetting life*.\n\nWhen these are understood and integrated: In the initial stages of the mysterious teaching, the interdependence of heart and breath must be practiced in the emptiness beyond the body, unattached to form—this is precisely *forgetting life*. When heart and breath settle into oneness, the primordial qi arrives of itself, form is whole and essence restored—this is the effect of *attaining life*. The Old Sage says: “Set the body aside, and the body is preserved.” Master Tan says: “Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.”\n\nMaster Bai Zi Qing says: “Forgetting form to nurture qi is the Golden Liquid; facing phenomena without heart is the Great Return. Forgetting form to nurture qi, qi transforms into spirit—this is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.” To “set aside” and to “forget”—are these not *forgetting life*? To “nurture” and to “return”—are these not *attaining life*?\n\nKnow that when heart and breath interdepend outside the body and reach great stillness, body and heart both forgotten, state and wisdom both dissolved, one attains the wondrousness of *forgetting life* and thereby gains *further life*—what the Old Sage called “being selfless yet able to perfect one’s self.” If one clings to the physical body in practice, this is purely a post-heaven function. Not only does one fail to grasp the principle of *forgetting life*, but one also fails to recognize the essence of nurturing life, diverging far from the true lineage of the mysterious teaching.\n\n**129. Attaining Life and Attaining Destiny**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Lie Yu Kou” chapter states: “Knowledge and wisdom externally connected breed resentment; courageous action invites many grudges; benevolence and righteousness invite many demands. Those who attain the essence of life are *kuai*; those who attain knowledge are *xiao*; those who attain the great destiny follow; those who attain the lesser destiny encounter.”\n\nLu Fang Hu says: “Knowledge and wisdom form one repository—when knowledge and wisdom are externally connected, they breed resentment. Courageous action forms one repository—courageous action invites grudges. Benevolence and righteousness form one repository—benevolence and righteousness invite many demands. Attaining life forms one repository—those who attain the essence of life progress toward reality, becoming *kuai* and greatly liberated. This repository is the highest vehicle. Attaining knowledge forms one repository—those who attain knowledge know Heaven and know humanity, becoming Heaven’s *xiao* offspring. Attaining destiny forms one repository—those who greatly attain say, ‘I follow it’; those who attain in small measure say, ‘I encounter it.’ Encountering implies submitting to destiny; following implies having no deliberate intent—this, too, is the highest vehicle of attaining destiny.”\n\nExplanation: *Attaining life* and *attaining destiny* are the proper duties of the profound scholar. *Attaining* means thorough comprehension. Only after *attaining life* can one cultivate life; only after *attaining destiny* can one fulfill destiny. The practice is simply the interdependence of heart and breath—this is what is meant by *following the breath*. From having breath, one returns to breathlessness, externally connecting with Heaven and Earth’s one qi. When the celestial mechanism is activated, it flows ceaselessly, and the foundation of destiny is thereby eternally secured.\n\n*Kuai* means great, signifying merging with the great naturalness. Those who *attain the great destiny* follow the breath to settle the spirit, live each day in accord with conditions, and ultimately follow the heart’s spontaneity without obstruction. Those who *attain the lesser destiny* merely accept what they encounter without resentment.\n\n**130. Holding the Contract and Holding the Thoroughfare**\nThe Old Sage says: “The sage holds the left contract but does not demand of others. Those with virtue hold the contract; those without virtue hold the thoroughfare.”\n\nSecret Explanation: The contract’s value lies in its correspondence. Heart and breath are the natural wondrous contract.\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract, awaiting the right to come and join. The left contract is the spirit; the right contract is the breath. Concentrating the spirit within the qi cavity (the emptiness beyond the body), one calmly awaits the breath’s approach—no need for the self to seek the breath. One need only wait with utmost sincerity. If the self seeks the breath, the breath may resist alignment, and through forced control, clinging, and rigidity, the breath turns coarse and hard to regulate. Form clings, fire arises—this is precisely the image of *holding the thoroughfare*. Through sincere influence, one allows the breath to return of its own accord, naturally harmonious. Like Emperor Shun’s pacification of the Miao tribes: two ranks of dancers with feathered shields, and after seventy days, the Miao came to submit—this is the subtlety of *holding the contract*. Those who enforce through coercion and military might belong to *holding the thoroughfare*; the Sage does not act thus.\n\n**131. Opening the Human and Opening Heaven**\nThe *Zhuangzi·Dashing Through Life* says: “Do not open the human’s Heaven, but open Heaven’s Heaven. Opening Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. Neither satiate with Heaven nor neglect the human, and the people will nearly return to their true nature.”\n\nLu Xixing says: “Those who cultivate the Dao know the wondrousness of effortless naturalness. Thus, they do not open the human’s Heaven but open Heaven’s Heaven. Opening Heaven’s Heaven means emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and clarity—illuminating the principle of naturalness. Opening the human’s Heaven means deluded knowledge arising, chiseling the undifferentiated aperture. Therefore, opening Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. *Virtue* means preserving the authenticity of Heaven’s power; *harm* means inflicting the damage of human artifice. Heaven, by this principle, nurtures our lives, yet we harm it—thus severing ourselves from Heaven. We obtain this principle as life, yet fail to preserve it—thus belittling ourselves as human. Neither satiate with Heaven nor neglect the human, and will we not nearly return to the true?”\n\nGui Zhenchuan says: “Heaven is natural; the human possesses knowledge and desire. Opening the human chisels apertures, and the undifferentiated perishes. Guarding qi preserves the human; leveling emotions preserves Heaven—this is the essence of preserving life.”\n\nXuanjing says: “Ordinary people, amid the six dusts of sensory realms, discriminate beauty and ugliness, knowledge proliferates, intellect runs wild, and they falsely claim material enjoyment. Unaware that emotions arise and wisdom is obstructed, they fall into peril. Heart scatters, spirit moves, essence trembles, qi depletes—gradually diminishing, life collapses, and the great destiny topples. This is *opening the human gives birth to harm*. As for those who cultivate the Dao: reversing perception and hearing, embracing emptiness and stillness, body and mind both tranquil—they summon primordial true yang, nourishing the corporeal form and fostering the Dharma-body. Once the mechanism of life is activated, it flows ceaselessly. Soon, spirit is whole, qi is full, the six senses are empty and still, and the power of inherent nature manifests—this is *opening Heaven gives birth to virtue*. Opening Heaven means Heaven’s heart governs, stillness and illumination never part, and the nature of Heaven grows radiant. Opening the human means the human heart governs, and the six senses scatter. This is the difference between following the current and reversing the flow.”\n\n**132. Warming Harmony and Burning Harmony**\nThe Old Sage reveals “harmony through emptiness”; Guangchengzi reveals “abiding in harmony”; Zhuangzi reveals “warming harmony.” The *Xu Wugui* chapter says: “Embracing virtue and warming harmony, one accords with the world—this is called the true person.” *Harmony* refers to the primordial harmonious qi. *Warming* means gently heating with a subtle fire. Using harmonious qi to permeate the four limbs and hundred bones, in extreme emptiness and profound stillness, ebb and flow merge—beauty resides within. This is called *warming harmony*. Thus, the *Huainanzi* also says: “Embracing virtue and warming harmony, the myriad things amass.” *Amass* is the image of ripening.\n\nThe study of warming harmony in the Mystery School is exceedingly subtle. When the practitioner’s effort reaches the point where external breathing becomes faint, naturally the body enters the state: the four limbs and hundred bones feel gently warmed, gradually softening into numbness. Blockages throughout the body gradually dissolve, from the crown to the soles, wholly steeped in the great harmony of the one qi—drunken, entranced. The Immortal School calls this *drinking harmony*, the first step toward longevity and eternal vision.\n\n*Burning harmony* means exhausting the primordial harmony. The *Zhuangzi·External Things* says: “With extreme worry, trapped in dual pitfalls with no escape, the cicada’s molting fails, the heart suspended between heaven and earth, restless and oppressed. Profit and harm grind against each other, generating excessive fire. The multitude burns harmony; the moon surely cannot withstand the fire. Thus, there is exhaustion, and the Dao is spent.”\n\nLu Fanghu says: “Those who cultivate truth and embody the Dao are empty, still, tranquil, and inactive. The fires of the five emotions are all subdued; profit and harm do not disturb the heart, and life and death do not alter the self. Those who do not know the Dao cannot endure worldly affairs, deeply worried and trapped in the dual pitfalls of profit and harm, with no escape. Restless and anxious, sitting uneasy, sleeping unsettled—this heart suspended between heaven and earth, restless and oppressed, cannot free itself. Profit and harm grind against each other, generating excessive fire, burning Heaven’s harmony. Thus, arise the afflictions of yin and yang. Not knowing the external cannot be relied upon, they engage in battle on the field of profit and harm, self-immolating like this. Therefore, the Daoist nurtures harmony, while the multitude burns harmony. *Burning* means scorching and searing. The character *moon* is uniquely placed—*moon* is water. Water cannot withstand fire, echoing the medical idea that one water cannot overcome five fires. Another interpretation: *moon* in ancient seal script is the character for *flesh*. The blood-formed body cannot withstand scorching and melting. Thus, there is exhaustion, and the Dao is spent.”\n\n\"Collapse\" signifies decline and death. The *Dao* here refers to the Way of life; when the Dao is exhausted, form and spirit perish with it. The intent is for people to still the heart’s fire through quietude, abiding in the realm of tranquility and non-action, fulfilling their natural lifespan without premature demise—this is the benevolence of saving the world.\n\nI note that Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Dao* states:\n*\"Palaces and chambers lie empty, yet the spirit dwells within,\nThe soul’s crucible scorches, drying the blood and fluids.\nOne sorrow, one joy, one thought, one indulgence,\nOne exertion, one labor—each gnaws at the body’s form.\nDawn’s harm, dusk’s damage, deluded and unaware,\nSpirit scattered, vitality lost, with no place to rest.\nSubtly worn away, gradually withering,\nQi and harmony depleted, the spirit departs.\"*\n\nThis precisely serves as a gloss for Zhuangzi’s \"burning harmony.\"\n\nScholars practice the movement of returning and reversal, where heart and breath depend on the external—then the heart becomes empty. With the heart empty, fire does not flare upward, and the fluids of Wood do not wither: this is the inner nurturing of harmony. When heart and breath settle into emptiness, the true *qi* of Qian’s yang externally steams the four limbs, penetrating the entire body. In an instant, inner and outer yin and yang harmonize: this is the outer nurturing of harmony. When inner and outer mutually nurture each other, vitality flourishes daily, and the foundation of the undying Dao is established.\n\n---\n\n**133. Having Method and Having No Method**\n\nZhuangzi’s *Carving Intent* states:\n*\"Those who carve intent and exalt conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, indulging in lofty discourse and resentful slander, do so merely to be contentious—these are the scholars of mountains and valleys, not men of the world, those who favor withering away or plunging into the abyss (first type).\nThose who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, practicing reverence, frugality, and yielding, do so merely to cultivate themselves—these are the scholars of peaceful eras, teachers and instructors, those who favor wandering and dwelling in learning (second type).\nThose who speak of great achievements, establishing great reputations, honoring ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior, do so merely to govern—these are the scholars of court and court, men who strengthen the state and achieve merit, those who favor annexation and consolidation (third type).\nThose who dwell in marshes and lakes, abide in leisure and openness, fishing and living idly, do so merely to be without action—these are the scholars of rivers and seas, recluses, those who favor leisure (fourth type).\nThose who practice breathing, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching, do so merely to prolong life—these are the practitioners of Dao-yin, those who nurture the body, those who favor the longevity of Peng Zu (fifth type).\nAs for those who are lofty without carving intent, cultivated without benevolence and righteousness, governed without merit and fame, at leisure without rivers and seas, long-lived without Dao-yin—nothing is forgotten, yet nothing is lacking. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow them: this is the Dao of heaven and earth, the virtue of the sage (sixth type).*\nThus it is said: *Serenity, stillness, silence, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of heaven and earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue.*\nThus it is said: *The sage rests therein; rest leads to equanimity. Equanimity leads to serenity. Serene and equanimous, worries and misfortunes cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus, their virtue is whole, and their spirit is not diminished.\"*\n\nQiu Qiongshan said: *\"Those who delight in mountains and marshes go forth but cannot return. Those who serve in court enter but cannot exit. Those content with teaching are constrained and cannot extend. Those absorbed in nurturing the body preserve but cannot forget—this is not the true nature of things.\"*\n\nLu Xixing said: *\"Having enumerated the five types of men with methods, he reverts to the sagely man without method. 'Carving' means strict and exacting; 'exalting' means holding in high esteem. 'Resentment' is indignation; 'slander' is defamation. 'Withering away and plunging into the abyss' means willingly embracing solitude and casting oneself into deep mountains and remote valleys as if plunging into the depths. 'Cultivating' means refining the self. 'Nothing forgotten, nothing lacking' conveys the meaning of 'non-action yet nothing left undone.' 'Serene and boundless' means without limit.\"*\n\nI observe that the five types Zhuangzi enumerates all carve and refine their intent, pursuing their preferences, yet cannot forget the self or things, returning to the One without trace. As for those who embody the Dao, cultivating nature and reverting to virtue, their bodies merge with true emptiness, their actions leave no tracks—thus, serene and boundless, all excellences follow them. The terms *forgetting*, *resting*, *equanimity*, *serenity*, *emptiness*, and *non-action* all align with the Dao, revealing the wondrous subtleties of restoring nature.\n\nScholars, in practicing the interdependence of heart and breath, value attaining equilibrium. Equilibrium makes the breath harmonious and the heart at peace. Once spirit and breath are both forgotten, one enters samadhi with ease, forgetting both self and dharmas, merging subject and object, transcending existence and non-existence—this is the moment of serene boundlessness. At this time, the true yang of heaven and earth converges and returns. Silent yet responsive, still yet able to act, the more empty, the more abundant; the more forgotten, the more pure; the more pure, the more transformed—until the dharma-realm and the self are utterly without separation. This is called the Dao merging into oneness. Only when unified does the spirit become unfettered; unfettered, it has no method. Abiding in existence yet not attached to it, dwelling in non-existence yet not devoid of it, neither yin nor yang can constrain it, nor can the workings of creation fathom it—is this not the path of the perfected?\n\nThus it is said: *\"Nothing forgotten, yet nothing to forget; nothing possessed, yet nothing lacking. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow.\"* This is the wondrous subtlety of the forgotten heart, unattainable by those who carve intent and cultivate; the wondrous subtlety of no-method, unattainable by those whose attachments remain unbroken. Thus, the distinction between carving intent and forgetting intent, between having no method and having method, is the difference between the mind that abides and the mind that does not abide.\n\n**134. Heavenly Union and Human Union**\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"The Dao of Heaven\" chapter:\nLong ago, Shun asked Yao, \"How does the Heavenly King employ his mind?\"\nYao replied, \"I do not scorn the friendless, nor abandon the destitute; I grieve for the dead, cherish the young, and pity women. This is how I employ my mind.\"\nShun said, \"Noble indeed, yet it is not great.\"\nYao asked, \"Then how should it be?\"\nShun said, \"Manifesting Heavenly virtue, one emerges in tranquility—sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed, as day and night follow their constant course, clouds drift and rain falls.\"\nYao said, \"How entangled and troubled I am! You are in union with Heaven; I am in union with man. Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients held greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all esteemed. Thus, those who in ancient times ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe \"Carving Intent\" chapter states: *\"Emptiness and tranquility accord with Heavenly virtue.\"* It also says: *\"The utmost in refinement and penetration unites with Heavenly principle.\"* Lu Xixing remarked: \"Manifesting Heavenly virtue to emerge in tranquility means governing by Heavenly virtue so that the myriad things are naturally at peace. Heaven’s virtue is non-action and spontaneity—thus the sun and moon shine of themselves, the four seasons proceed of themselves, day and night follow their constant course of themselves, clouds drift of themselves, and rain falls of themselves. Without intent toward things, the myriad things are naturally at peace. The movement of the Heavenly Dao accumulates nothing; the virtue of one who rules others is likewise. Truly, this is union with Heaven, not union with man.\"\n\nXuanjing said: Governing the state and governing the self follow the same principle. Heavenly virtue is the mind of Heaven. To unite with the mind of Heaven is to be empty and spontaneous, with the fire-phase purely of the prior-heaven, making return easy. To unite with the human mind is to generate intent and cling to forms, purely forced and contrary to spontaneity, step by step falling into the posterior-heaven, so that the effect of return is difficult to see. The phrase *\"manifesting Heavenly virtue to emerge in tranquility\"* is most wondrous: if one’s path accords with the mind of Heaven, then though one emerges, in stillness there is stability, in activity there is stability—within the four dignities, there is stability at all times. This is the meaning of *\"held by the Great Stability.\"*\n\nThus, emptiness and tranquility, the wondrous nature serene and unobstructed, quiescent illumination forgetting knowledge, acting without hindrance—though engaged in activity, one is not burdened by existence; though abiding in non-action, one does not drown in nothingness. Neither clinging to existence nor nothingness, nor dwelling in the mean, one may transcend and be at ease. Baozhenzi said: \"Now, man is indeed minute. What makes one a Heavenly immortal is that one’s mind is Heaven’s mind, and one must restore one’s original nature. Failing to restore one’s original nature, one drifts to the ends of emotion. Restoring nature is the way to Heaven; drifting in emotion is the way to man. As for man—you alone examine how the Master employed his mind: how much was it like man, and how much like Heaven? Abandon the human, approach the Heavenly. When the mind is wholly Heaven, this is how one becomes a true person. When man attains the true, one may speak of Heavenly immortals.\"\n\nXuanjing said: With emotion present, one is an ordinary person; with emotion forgotten, one is a sage-immortal. Forgetting emotion and extinguishing perceptions is the secret essential for turning the ordinary into the sagely. As for the practice, it lies solely in the single practice of harmonious samādhi. Mind and breath interdepend, and through extreme dependence, they transform. Breath has no exhalation or inhalation, thought has no arising or ceasing. Serenely entering samādhi, body and mind are both quiescent, inner and outer are forgotten together, person and dharma are both relinquished, principle and phenomenon are both extinguished, realm and wisdom are wondrously empty—this may be called abandoning the human and uniting with Heaven. One who unites with Heaven is of the same substance as the Great Void, of the same function as Heaven and Earth. Being of the same substance means the Dao is pervasively one; being of the same function means acting without intent. Master Miaozheng said: *\"Responding without intent, extinguishing illumination yet awareness is complete—unless one has reached the ultimate of the Dao, cast off the body, and has no dependence, one cannot easily speak of this.\"*\n\n**135. True Emptiness and Obdurate Emptiness**\n\nTrue emptiness and obdurate emptiness: one has creation, the other has no creation; one is perfect emptiness, the other is severed emptiness. Regarding practice, true emptiness means external breathing ceases, spirit and qi unite in stability, thought and念 are both extinguished, and nature and life become one. When extreme stillness moves, at the moment when the single yang returns, the wondrous manifests. Here, existence and nothingness are one, the wondrous aperture is the same mystery. Wuyuanzi said: *\"A bright moon in the sky illuminates the mind of Heaven; at midnight, thunder shakes the divine continent.\"* This accords with the wondrousness of true emptiness that is not empty. Thus, true emptiness fuses existence into emptiness, in the utmost nothingness contains the utmost existence—empty yet not empty, substance and function are one, the subtle and manifest are without gap. Here, there is inexhaustible life, boundless creation. The *Great Penetration Sutra*, \"True Emptiness\" chapter, states: *\"Born before Heaven, born yet without form; existing after Heaven, existing yet without substance. Yet without substance, it has never existed. Thus it is called inconceivable.\"* It also says: *\"Embracing the myriad images in its body, not clinging to a single thread.\"* And: *\"When mind is extinguished, nature appears, like space without form. Profoundly and perfectly full.\"*\n\nFuqiuweng said: *\"True emptiness is without self; greatly returning, greatly restoring, it is wholly one qi, returning to unite with the prior-heaven.\"* This is the wondrous purport of true emptiness. As for obdurate emptiness, it is the kind of biased stillness and sinking emptiness—dim and dull, merely suppressing thoughts from arising, the mind like still water. The ancients compared it to dead water that does not harbor dragons, and rightly so. What is called *\"the body like withered wood, the mind like dead ashes\"* is this. Thus, there is no life, no creation. The modern school of desiccated Chan precisely accords with this image.\n\nThe elixir method holds the single crucial technique of true emptiness—this is the orthodox transmission of the Zhong-Lü lineage. It requires entering the great samādhi of breathless stillness, where practice deepens until body and mind are utterly quiescent and unmoving. Both self and dharmas are relinquished, and the wondrous emptiness of realm and wisdom arises, within and without alike, forming the symbol ○. At this stage of practice, internally, one’s native earth manifests, the Five Phases and Four Images naturally unite, Kan and Li spontaneously merge, completing the work of the seven returns. Externally, the earth of Wu appears, the primordial qi of prior-heaven arrives unbidden, embracing my dharma-body and nurturing my physical form, bestowing benefits upon both form and dharma. Original yang daily grows, achieving the wondrous nine restorations. External restoration and internal return proceed simultaneously, bathing and sealing without need for arrangement.\n\nThus, Master Zhongli said: *\"The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. I too am a thing—therefore I probe its origin, gather its spirit, depart from being to return to non-being, reverting to true emptiness. To revert to true emptiness, one must first remove its hindrance.\"* Pure Yang said: *\"The wondrous treasure is refined not by chance; only when true emptiness is realized does one transcend.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"I await but to stir the fire and refine true emptiness, seeking light to shatter the primordial chaos.\"* And: *\"Only upon reaching the station of true emptiness does great function manifest—like the Dragon Girl offering a single precious pearl, golden light appears. Only then is it a gain forever secured.\"* And: *\"When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes; the dharma-body endures, never falling into emptiness.\"* And: *\"Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial cycle, forging true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\"* And: *\"When the golden elixir is refined and true emptiness is realized, the body remains unmoving for a thousand years.\"*\n\nThis is the elixir formula of the Shaoyang and Wen-Shi lineages, both emphasizing the verification of true emptiness. Ancestor Chongyang said: *\"In empty space, reflect upon the scene of emptiness—illuminating true emptiness, emptiness is not empty.\"* And: *\"Within the tomb, the scene of true emptiness is ever present; awakening to emptiness upon emptiness, no dust arises.\"* And: *\"To perceive true emptiness, the primordial void is the ancestor.\"* Wang Yuyang said: *\"A single awakening to true emptiness completes the immortal.\"* Qiu Changchun’s *\"Song of the Great Void\"* states: *\"Chan as the lineage, Dao as the ancestor—shatter the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Radiant light interpenetrates, containing true emptiness; yet laugh at the one, two, three, four, five. Neither Dao nor Chan, merging with the profound and obscure, naturally so. Clearing the eye of purity for all things, the red emptiness shines boundlessly.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng said: *\"Without reaching true emptiness, the yang spirit cannot emerge.\"* Master Baozhen said: *\"Only when true emptiness is without self can one transcend and transform the embryo.\"* Master Zhang said: *\"Seek the mysterious and wondrous to unite with true emptiness—when the affair of the void is complete.\"* This is the evidence of the Pure Yang lineage’s Northern School, which upholds true emptiness as paramount. In the preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, Master Ziyang wrote: *\"Yet the golden elixir arises from non-being—it must not be mistaken for obdurate emptiness. Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, non-being that is not devoid, thus true non-being.\"* Shi Xinglin’s *Returning to the Source* states: *\"Who knows the wondrous elixir formula? Throughout the day, refine true emptiness.\"* Chen Cuixu said: *\"When perfect and complete, within and without are one true emptiness.\"* Bai Yuchan said: *\"The cinnabar tripod of true emptiness is impartial; the crescent furnace of emptiness is spiritually penetrating.\"* And: *\"When Kan and Li are conjoined and the cycles of Gou and Fu harmonize, the life pulse of true emptiness is realized. The principle of heaven and earth, the spring wind of the myriad things—beyond yin and yang, the natural union of husband and wife—with a single touch, success is achieved.\"* Longmeizi said: *\"All conditioned things are unreal; awakening to the true source, emptiness is not empty.\"* This is clear evidence that the Pure Yang lineage’s Southern School also upholds true emptiness as essential.\n\nMaster Qianxu of the Eastern Ancestry composed *The Southern Florescence’s Supplementary Ink*, entirely expounding the wondrous discourse on true emptiness. Formerly, Master Wang instructed his inner disciples, also emphasizing true emptiness as the most crucial technique, calling it the mysterious pivot of elixir methods, the secret key of return, the path to perfection, and the swiftest route to enlightenment.\n\nYet, surveying ancient and modern elixir texts, those speaking of dragon-tiger, lead, and mercury are ubiquitous, while those revealing true emptiness are as rare as morning stars—why is this? Dongshan said: *\"Embodying true emptiness requires no forging.\"* Wan Hui said: *\"True emptiness does not destroy the nature of numinous wisdom; wondrous function is ever constant, without contrivance.\"* The *\"Heavenly Gate\"* passage in the *Zhuangzi*—*\"Exiting without root, entering without aperture, inherently substantial yet without location, inherently long yet without origin or end\"*—also illustrates the meaning of true emptiness.\n\nEmbodying true emptiness is the non-dual dharma-gate of Chan and the mysterious. Thus, Chen Nigan said: *\"Returning to the origin is true emptiness.\"* Ancestor Lü said: *\"The whole world seeks wondrous apertures—who in the space of emptiness attains the true meaning?\"* Considering the five ancestral texts: upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the wondrous aperture and the mysterious become one, being and non-being unite\"*—this grasps the essential principle of the *Daodejing*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the cosmos is in hand, the myriad transformations arise in the body\"*—this attains the dynamic function of the *Yinfu Jing*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the three families naturally meet, the four images naturally converge, the five phases naturally gather\"*—this fulfills the talismanic treasure of the *Cantong Qi*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"true nature naturally reveals itself, delusive confusion naturally dissipates\"*—this ascends to the inner chamber of the *Wuzhen Pian*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"through stillness one responds, the qi of prior-heaven’s true unity arrives unbidden—no plowing or hoeing is needed, the great earth becomes gold\"*—this opens the treasure trove of the *Ruyao Jing*.\n\nThe five ancestral texts of the schools all align perfectly when sealed with true emptiness, without exception. They truly serve as the guiding principle of profound cultivation and the forge and bellows for entering sagehood.\n\n**136. Holding the Rear to Whip the Rear**\n\nThe *Liezi*’s \"Explaining Symbols\" chapter states: \"Master Liezi studied under Hujiu Zilin. Hujiu Zilin said, ‘If you understand *holding the rear*, then we may speak of *holding the self*.’ Liezi replied, ‘I wish to hear about *holding the rear*.’ He said, ‘Observe your shadow, and you will know.’ Liezi turned and beheld his shadow: when the body was bent, the shadow was crooked; when the body was straight, the shadow was upright. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the body and do not lie in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on the self. This is called *holding the rear to abide in the forefront*.\"\n\nExplanation: Breath arises from the heart (the ancients, in creating the character for *breath* [息], made it from *self* [自] and *heart* [心], imbued with profound meaning). When breath is regulated, the heart is still; when the heart is agitated, breath is coarse; when the heart is calm, breath is fine. Breath and heart are like shadow and form. Thus, the interdependence of heart and breath is the secret of *holding the rear*. If one can hold the rear, one returns to the prior-heaven and abides in the prior-heaven—this is the wondrous Dao of the posterior-heaven returning to the prior-heaven.\n\nSome say: *Holding the rear to abide in the forefront* is the purport of the old sage’s teaching, *\"Putting the self last, one finds oneself first.\"* Thus, in the profound tradition’s cultivation, heart and breath externally interdepend to reach the state of true emptiness—this is the esoteric principle of *holding the rear to abide in the forefront*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" chapter states: \"Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, ‘I have heard that Zhu Shen was a student of nurturing life. You have associated with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?’ Tian Kaizhi replied, ‘I merely sweep the courtyard with a broom—what could I have learned from the Master?’ The Duke said, ‘Master Tian, do not be modest. I wish to hear it.’ Kaizhi said, ‘I heard the Master say: *One who is good at nurturing life is like a shepherd—he watches those behind and whips them* (by whipping those behind, the ones ahead are pressed forward, and the flock moves steadily along).’ The Duke said, ‘What does this mean?’ Tian Kaizhi replied, ‘In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelt in the mountains and drank from streams, neither contending with others for profit. At seventy, he still had the complexion of an infant. Unfortunately, he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the wealthy and poor alike, yet at forty, he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer, yet illness attacked his inner.’\"\n\nThese two men both failed to whip those behind.’”\n\nThe commentary states: The Dao exists before Heaven, yet without relying on the postnatal physical form, one cannot advance in cultivation. Therefore, the wise preserve their bodies by not standing beneath crumbling walls, not treading perilous paths, not squandering their spirit to chase fame or seek praise. All profitless matters that harm body and mind are cast aside. Nurturing the inner to cultivate the self, guarding the outer to protect the body—only thus can the postnatal not burden the prenatal. *Laozi* says: “Which is dearer, fame or the self? Which is greater, the self or wealth?” It also says: “Why would the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his body as light when weighed against the world?” Both express this principle. Master Shao said: “If asked about the prenatal, not a word exists; only in the postnatal must one apply effort.” This too conveys the meaning of whipping those behind. By diligently tending to what follows, one may transcend what precedes. This is the intent of *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* in “whipping the rear” and “holding to the rear”—it embodies the profound meaning of refining the true through the provisional. We ought to pay heed.\n\n---\n\n**137. Mutual Propulsion and Mutual Overcoming**\n*The Book of Changes* elucidates how yin and yang mutually propel one another to generate creation. As it says: “When the sun departs, the moon arrives; when the moon departs, the sun arrives—sun and moon mutually propel one another, and brightness arises. When cold departs, heat arrives; when heat departs, cold arrives—cold and heat mutually propel one another, and the year is completed.” It also says: “Hard and soft mutually propel one another to produce change.” All these are examples. The final section of *The Classic of Yin Conformity* clarifies how yin and yang mutually overcome one another to return to the unknowable true emptiness of yin and yang. Thus it says: “The art of yin and yang mutually overcoming is luminously manifest, advancing beyond images.” This reveals how yin and yang, in mutual containment, both perish—neither existence nor nonexistence, neither brightness nor darkness, neither arising nor ceasing—precisely the wondrous principle of transcending duality through opposition. Mutual propulsion follows the natural course; mutual overcoming reverses it. Mutual propulsion creates duality—this is the Dao of the *Changes*. Mutual overcoming dissolves duality—this is the Dao of the Elixir. Mutual propulsion entails sequence; mutual overcoming occurs simultaneously. Heart and breath interdependent, nature and life united—this is the image of mutual overcoming.\n\n---\n\n**138. Ancient Origin and Doubtful Origin**\n*Laozi* says: “Meet it, yet you do not see its beginning; follow it, yet you do not see its end. Grasp the ancient Dao to steer the present being. To know the ancient origin is called the discipline of the Dao.” *Zhuangzi* says: “From singing I heard of the Dark and Vast; from the Dark and Vast I heard of the Threefold Void; from the Threefold Void I heard of the Doubtful Origin.”\n\nThe commentary states: The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. Though called an origin, it is in truth without beginning or end. Hence it is said: “Meet it, yet you do not see its beginning; follow it, yet you do not see its end.” This is the true emptiness of the Limitless, the source of the Great Dao, the root of nature and life. In cultivation, to unite with the ancient origin is to awaken obscurely to the original awakening. The Doubtful Origin, though without origin, differs in name from the Ancient Origin but shares the same meaning.\n\n---\n\n**139. Inner and Outer Restraint**\n*Zhuangzi*’s “Gengsang Chu” chapter says: “Those who are outwardly restrained (韄, pronounced *huò*, meaning bound) cannot be seized with haste, for they will turn inward to close themselves off. Those who are inwardly restrained cannot be seized with entanglement, for they will turn outward to close themselves off. Those who are both inwardly and outwardly restrained—even the power of virtue cannot sustain them, let alone those who abandon the Dao and act recklessly!”\n\nLu Xixing says: “In learning, the essential point lies in forgetting both inner and outer restraints entirely. When one is fettered within, it is called inner restraint; when fettered without, it is called outer restraint. *Huò* refers to binding things with leather. The human heart should be empty, still, and tranquil. If, upon encountering things, it cannot pass beyond without lingering, it is seized by grasping and taking—thus the heart is bound by outer restraint. Seeking the original substance amid this restless disturbance is like an object resisting within: the inner is already full, so it closes inward and does not open. If one moves with desire and cannot flow with transformation, thoughts churn ceaselessly—the heart is bound by inner restraint. Seeking the original substance amid this entanglement is like having already been touched by sensation: external conditions are hard to sever, so it closes outward and is difficult to release. *Zhuo* means to seek; *jian* (pronounced *jié*) means to fasten securely. Such newly coined expressions are like clouds drifting beyond the sunset—certainly not something those who consume cooked food could articulate. ‘Those who are both inwardly and outwardly restrained—even the power of virtue cannot sustain them’ means that when inner and outer are both fettered, even those who possess virtue cannot maintain themselves, let alone those who follow the Dao. To possess virtue is to have cleansed oneself thoroughly, naturally free from restraint—this is likely a hypothetical statement.”\n\nXuanjing says: The above explanations of principle are already quite clear. In sum, outer restraint means circumstances that melt the heart; inner restraint means the heart that clings to circumstances. When the dust of circumstances is empty, outer restraint dissolves; when the mind’s perceptions are forgotten, inner restraint vanishes. Only when both heart and circumstances are forgotten do inner and outer become empty together, and wisdom shines forth. In the cultivation and realization of the Mystery School, one first empties body and mind, then simultaneously liberates inner and outer roots and dust. The work must proceed through the interdependence of heart and breath, gradually entering realization. Once great samadhi is constant, inner and outer naturally merge, and principle cannot restrain what is restrained or close what is closed. As Li Daochun said: “When the heart is still, one realizes non-arising.”\n\n---\n\n**140. Preserving Radiance and Preserving the True**\n*Zhuangzi*’s “Equalizing Things” chapter says: “Pour into it, yet it is never full; draw from it, yet it never runs dry. Yet you do not know its source—this is called preserving radiance.”\n\n**140. Preserving Radiance and Preserving the True (continued)**\n\nThe *Tian Zifang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: “In his person, he is true—human in appearance yet empty by nature, following conditions while preserving the true, pure yet accommodating all things. When things lack the Dao, he responds with upright bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions.”\n\nThe commentary explains: *Preserving radiance* means veiling one’s light, akin to the *Book of Changes* image of “brightness entering the earth.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “The origin lies hidden in illumination; within, it illumines the body.” This is the essence of preserving radiance.\n\nThe oral instruction states: Turn the light inward and reflect; conceal the spirit in emptiness. Regulate the breath to be continuous, gradually condensing and settling until the breath has no exit or entry, and inner and outer attain stillness. Entering the realm of great quiescence, one returns to nothingness—unaware, unknowing, without self or other. This is called *concealing the esoteric*, also known as *preserving radiance*. To know preserving radiance is to know preserving the true.\n\nThe *true* is the true nature. Nurtured by samadhi and wisdom, it shines forth anew each day. Lu Xixing said: “*Following emptily* means emptying the self to accord with conditions. *Preserving the true* means nurturing the true through emptiness and stillness.” When heart and breath interdepend to enter great samadhi, and inner and outer harmonize, this is the unified practice of preserving the true and preserving radiance.\n\n---\n\n**141. Cultivating Nature and Cultivating Life**\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*“To cultivate nature alone, neglecting life—\nThis is the foremost malady in cultivation.\nTo refine only the ancestral nature, not the elixir,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\nThose who grasp the life-school yet lose the ancestral nature\nResemble a mirror without its precious backing—\nA fool whose lifespan matches heaven and earth,\nHolding the family wealth yet lacking the master’s authority.”*\n\nThis song, framed in the duality of Daoist nature and life, urges their mutual completion—right and proper. Yet if scholars cling to this to misrepresent Buddhist cultivation, dismissing it as ignorant of the life-school and confined to the yin spirit’s realm, they commit a grave error.\n\nFor Daoism speaks of *nature* in terms of its relation to life, spirit to qi, true emptiness to wondrous existence—always in duality. Buddhism speaks of *nature* as transcending life and death, spirit and qi, existence and non-existence, sentience and insentience. The *wondrous luminous true nature* is the absolute true, not a relative entity. How can one critique Buddhism’s realm prior to the Aeon of Thunderous Silence using the standards of the Mystery School?\n\n**Question:** Then does the Buddha’s *intent-born body* also belong to the yang spirit?\n**Answer:** One who realizes the Dharma-body of self-nature transcends all dualities of yin and yang, light and dark. The *Book of Changes* says: “What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called *spirit*.” The Buddha’s Dharma-body is pure, all-pervading, subtle, and all-embracing—beyond conjecture or measure. To gauge the Buddha’s intent-born body by the yardstick of yin and yang is to fall forever short. Only when the scholar’s emotional measures are utterly dissolved, and suchness is directly realized, can one attain even a fraction of correspondence.\n\n---\n\n**142. Yin Spirit and Yang Spirit**\n\nThe *yin spirit* is the projected consciousness prior to the complete dissolution of the five aggregates. The *yang spirit* is the intent-born body manifest after the five aggregates are fully dissolved.\n\nThe distinction between yin and yang hinges solely on whether the five aggregates are dissolved—not on the presence or absence of form or sound. Foxes, deer, and other spirits in deep mountains that assume human form are but transformations of refined essence—how could they be called yang spirits?\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, in its section on dissolving the five aggregates, states: “When the mind departs the body and reflects upon its own face, coming and going freely without obstruction, this is called the exhaustion of the *receptivity aggregate*.” It further says: “When the receptivity aggregate is exhausted, though outflows may not yet be fully extinguished, the mind leaves the body like a bird freed from its cage. From this mortal form, one ascends through the sixty sacred stages of bodhisattvahood, attaining the intent-born body, dwelling without hindrance.”\n\nHere, the *Śūraṅgama* is perfectly clear: only when the *form* and *receptivity* aggregates are both dissolved can the body depart its form and move freely. Yet if the *conception*, *volition*, and *consciousness* aggregates remain unbroken, lacking supernatural transformation and the ability to benefit beings, what emerges is the yin spirit. Advancing further through the sixty sacred stages of bodhisattvahood, one attains the intent-born body—equivalent to the Daoist *true person*.\n\nThe *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* states: “The bodhisattva-mahāsattva’s intent-born body, through the power of the *illusion-like samādhi*, manifests supernatural mastery, conjuring adorned sacred forms of all kinds simultaneously, without obstruction.” It further says: “Having entered the *Immovable Ground*, with boundless samādhi at will, one attains the intent-born body, the *illusion-like samādhi*, and ultimate mastery of power and wisdom, freely aiding and benefiting all beings.”\n\nHere, it is made clear that only with the intent-born body, through the power of samādhi, can one manifest wondrous adornments, myriad supernatural abilities, and instantaneous fulfillment of intent—unobstructed and free. This differs from the *Śūraṅgama*’s “mind departing the body.”\n\nOnly when the *consciousness aggregate* is dissolved does the dawn of nirvana arise, and the self-nature’s spiritual function manifest, enabling the attainment of this body. According to the *Laṅkāvatāra*, there are three kinds of intent-born bodies:\n\n1. **The Intent-Born Body of Samādhi-Joy and Right Absorption**: When the three [samādhis] are fully ripened, the Dharma-body gains unfettered mastery, appearing and vanishing at will. With samādhi’s right absorption as the root of the perfected Dao-embryo, it is called the *intent-born body of samādhi-joy and right absorption*.\n\n2. **The Intent-Born Body of Awakened Dharma-Nature**: For bodhisattvas from the eighth stage onward, who penetrate all dharmas as self-nature’s manifestations, attaining mastery over mind and dharma, this body manifests countless Dharma-body forms, replete with adornments, pervading all buddha-lands without obstruction. It is called the *intent-born body of awakened dharma-nature*.\n\n3. **The Intent-Born Body of Species-Coemergence and Non-Action**: For bodhisattvas at the stage of Equal Awakening, with the vajra-mind, they sever the subtlest ignorance of the arising mark of existence. Once the flowing stream of birth-and-death is exhausted, they can manifest a thousand kinds of bodies across ten thousand species, responding to all without exception—yet without action, without effort, without mind, without conditions. This is called the *intent-born body of species-coemergence and non-action*. Among the three, this is the most transcendent.\n\nIn the profound school, when the Dao-embryo is perfected in the tenth month, the true person manifests in form, having already attained the first kind of intent-born body. By the time the three-year nurturing of the One is complete, they can divide their body into countless forms, entering the second kind of intent-born body. Finally, upon returning to the origin and completing the Dao, they enter the third kind of intent-born body.\n\n*The Record of Marvelous Encounters in the Sea and Mountains* states: \"Yao Pingzhong of the Southern School, while on Mount Damian, encountered the two patriarchs Zhong and Lü. The patriarchs instructed him to cultivate in stillness within a mountain cave. After eighty-one days, he could project his spirit, transform at will, and know past and future, believing he had attained realization. The patriarchs returned and said, ‘This is but a yin-spirit; it cannot endure long. You must obtain the golden fluid—this is the yang elixir.’ Lüzu then revealed to him the secret of the ninefold return. Pingzhong thereafter concealed his traces, cultivated diligently, accumulated merit and practice, and ultimately achieved the great Dao.\"\n\nNote that Pingzhong’s initial projection of the yin-spirit corresponds to what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* describes as \"the mind leaving the body to observe its own face\"—this is not an intent-born body.\n\nWhen the First Patriarch Bodhidharma entered quiescence, he was buried on Mount Xiong’er. Later, during the Wei dynasty, Song Yun, returning from a mission to the Western Regions, encountered the master on the Congling Mountains. He saw him walking alone, carrying a single sandal. Yun asked, \"Where are you going?\" The master replied, \"To the Western Heaven.\" He further told Yun, \"Your lord has already departed the world.\" Yun, bewildered, parted ways with the master and continued eastward. Upon returning to report his mission, he found that Emperor Ming had already passed away. When Emperor Xiaozhuang ascended the throne, Yun reported the matter in full. The emperor ordered the tomb opened, but only an empty coffin was found, with a single leather sandal remaining. (*Biographies of Divine Monks*, fascicle four)\n\nObserve that what Bodhidharma manifested was an intent-born body. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, in its \"Ten Grounds\" chapter, expounds the vast and wondrous realm of the intent-born body—this may be consulted for reference.\n\n---\n\n**The Mechanisms of Killing and Stealing**\nThe upper section of the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* reveals the subtlety of the *killing mechanism*, while the middle section elucidates the principle of the *stealing mechanism*. Both the killing and stealing mechanisms operate through inversion—secret essentials for reversing the flow of life’s momentum and returning to the origin.\n\nThe text states:\n> When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift and constellations alter;\n> When Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land;\n> When humans unleash their killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth overturn;\n> When Heaven and humans jointly unleash it, the myriad transformations are stabilized at their foundation.\n\nThe nature of reality is without birth or extinction, yet what appears as birth and extinction is qi, not nature. Master Qianxu said, \"Nature is originally unborn; it rides the momentum of qi to manifest birth.\" Thus, the key to reversing the flow lies in the interdependence of heart and breath—from having breath, one enters breathlessness; from having thoughts, one enters thoughtlessness. When breath and thought are both dissolved, true emptiness fully manifests. Then, the roots and dust no longer pair, the mind and consciousness are utterly extinguished, and the original nature shines forth, revealing the great function.\n\nThis aligns with what Lüzu called \"having already given birth, then killing life.\" Here, the dependent and the proper revolve and transform, the myriad transformations are stabilized at their foundation, one instantly transcends the leaky, the bonds of the five aggregates are shattered, and the three virtues are perfectly realized—is this not the subtlety of the killing mechanism?\n\nThus, by revolving birth-and-extinction into quiescent extinction, body and mind remain unmoved, embracing Heaven and Earth. The Buddhist school speaks of \"breaking the clouds to turn,\" while the profound school speaks of \"the killing mechanism\"—their meaning is one.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Categorized Explanation of the Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* states:\n> The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says, \"The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.\" That yin precedes and yang follows reflects the principle of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things: without stillness, there is no arising of movement; thus, *Bo* (\"Splitting Apart\") precedes *Fu* (\"Return\"). The *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* in one fascicle is the pivot of yin-yang interpenetration. Here, the divine is extinguished in the divine, and the non-divine is born in the divine. This is where the hidden and manifest of life and emergence reside; the gate through which inversion and return pass; the convergence of the waxing and waning of the sun and moon; the path of the coming and going of the great and small; the root of the control of death and life; the ground where kindness and harm ride upon each other; the realm of the advance and retreat of water and fire.\n\nThe Oral Instructions state: The subtlety of the killing mechanism lies first in recognizing the Mysterious Pass, the single aperture. Begin from the point of movement, revolve the breath to return to the origin, and settle both body and mind. Within and without, all is emptiness—here, the divine is extinguished in the divine, and the non-divine is born in the divine.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Revolve the breath to follow the origin, revolve the method to return to the void. Entering the stream, the locus vanishes; what is heard is exhausted in hearing; what is perceived is emptied in perception; the emptiness of emptiness is extinguished. Once arising and ceasing are extinguished, quiescent extinction manifests.\" All these illustrate the subtlety of the killing mechanism.\n\nChan Master Jiashan said: \"The six gates remain unsealed (as in the sixth month, when rest and return cease), and the four thoroughfares leave no trace.\" Chan Master Sixin said: \"When the six sense gates are empty, the myriad dharmas are without arising or ceasing.\" These, too, reveal the subtlety of the killing mechanism. There is no better way to dissolve adhesions and cast off fetters.\n\nThe *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* further states: \"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—such is the principle of the Dao. Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of humanity; humanity is the thief of the myriad things. When the three thieves are in harmony, the Three Powers are at peace. Thus it is said: Eat in accord with the seasons, and the hundred bones are ordered; move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace.\"\n\nIt also states: \"As for the mechanism of thievery, none under Heaven can see it, none can know it. The noble person who attains it preserves the body; the petty person who attains it squanders life.\"\n\nThe passage from the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* still speaks of the workings of a single qi. This void and nonexistent qi, when attained, gives life; when lost, brings death. Infants can unite heart and breath, so their respiratory mechanism gathers the true yang of Heaven and Earth. Once the passions awaken and desires arise, the breath becomes short and shallow—more is exhaled than inhaled. The primordial qi within the body, through this respiratory mechanism, returns once more to the void. This is what is meant by \"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life\" (in truth, one gives life to oneself and kills oneself).\n\nThe marvel of the immortals' return lies in responding through stillness. Thus, heart and breath depend on each other externally, allowing spirit and breath to settle and body and mind to enter stillness. By uniting the void of one’s body with the void of Heaven and Earth, one naturally reverses the qi mechanism. Then, the primordial yang of Heaven and Earth comes unbidden and arrives unsought. What was once taken from the body is returned to it, and things return to their original master. Though crudely called the \"mechanism of thievery,\" it is in fact the return to the original source, the inheritance of one’s ancestral legacy.\n\nWhen the practitioner’s cultivation reaches the emptiness of the fundamental substance, where roots and dust are both extinguished and self and other are no longer established, the entire dharma realm manifests in purity and fullness throughout the body. How then could one speak of thievery or the stolen? This is what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls \"the unconditioned true suchness, where the nature is pure and luminously revealed.\"\n\nOne must understand that the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* sets humanity and Heaven in opposition, hence the distinction between the thief and the stolen. As long as the view of subject and object remains uneliminated and the attachment to self and other is not dissolved, one has not entered the gate of non-duality or attained the function of oneness. But when the nature merges with true emptiness and the singular true is revealed alone, then mountains, rivers, and the great earth fully manifest as the body of the Dharma King. One realizes that Heaven and Earth share the same root as the self, and the myriad things are one with the self. This is what *Zhuangzi* calls \"the Dao pervading the one.\" Here, the view of subject and object is extinguished, and the attachment to self and other is dissolved.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under Heaven.\" Responding through stillness, heart and environment merge, self and other are no longer separate—this is the discourse of seeing the truth. The \"mechanism of thievery\" in the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* is nothing more than the function of stillness and response. In conventional terms, it provisionally illustrates the principle of theft and seizure, but it is not ultimate. Practitioners must not cling to it.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* describes the young child turning back to recognize the father and thereby inheriting the family legacy. When we cultivate the Dao, quieting the heart and stilling thoughts, emptying body and mind, and dissolving views and attachments, we reach the state of oneness where self and other are not separate and things and self are merged. This, too, is the inheritance of one’s original family legacy, not theft or seizure.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Cultivating the nature returns to virtue; when virtue is perfected, it is one with the beginning. Oneness is emptiness, and emptiness is vastness.\" He also says: \"The great one pervades it.\" Such discourse aligns with the fundamental principles of Daoism and harmonizes with Confucianism and Buddhism, perfectly uniting with the gate of non-duality.\n\n---\n\n**Heavenly Mechanism and Spiritual Mechanism**\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Those whose desires are deep have shallow heavenly mechanisms.\" Chen Cuixu says: \"Seize the marvel of the heavenly mechanism, and at midnight, observe the Dipper’s handle.\" He also says: \"Seizing the true workings of the heavenly mechanism, within the body lies the Jade Pure Heaven.\" And again: \"It is precisely because the heavenly mechanism is simple and wondrous that it is scattered throughout the alchemical texts yet never revealed.\"\n\nChen Baoyi says: \"If one does not intentionally seek lead and mercury, how can one awaken to the heavenly mechanism and congeal the sacred embryo?\" Lü Zu says: \"The heavenly mechanism runs deep, deeper still—mere talk of ten thousand kalpas or a thousand pieces of gold is futile.\" Ge Xianweng says: \"The Jade Liquid irrigates, the Cavern Chamber’s tassels flow. The heavenly mechanism is openly revealed, and the myriad sounds cannot compare.\" These are the teachings on the heavenly mechanism.\n\nThe *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* states: \"There is a wondrous device from which the ten thousand images arise. The Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle conceal the spiritual mechanism like ghosts.\" Chen Momo says: \"The two numinous medicines naturally unite; the subtle spiritual mechanism is sought here.\" Zhang Sanfeng says: \"Use the spiritual mechanism to subtly align with the celestial cycle, guarding body and mind against danger and peril.\" Li Qing’an says: \"That which abides within is spirit; that which issues forth is mechanism. Still and unmoving is spirit; responsive and penetrating is mechanism. Hidden and unfathomable is spirit; adaptable and boundless is mechanism. Encompassed within the body is spirit; extended to the myriad things is mechanism.\" These are the teachings on the spiritual mechanism.\n\nXuanjing says: The heavenly mechanism is the single, supremely numinous qi of the primordial. This is what Confucius called \"the heart of Heaven and Earth,\" and what Master Zhou’s *Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate* called \"the true of the Ultimate of Non-being.\" The spiritual mechanism is the wondrous, natural workings of transformation within the dim and obscure, the alchemical timing.\n\nThe \"wondrous device\" refers to the external Mysterious Pass. Those whose desires run deep lose more primordial qi, their primordial essence flows away, and their primordial yang grows dimmer by the day. Hence, it is said that \"the heavenly mechanism is shallow.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The ancients said the heavenly mechanism must not be leaked. Now you openly reveal the marvels of the Dao—are you not leaking the heavenly mechanism?\" Xuanjing replied: \"You take oral instructions to be the heavenly mechanism, but this is not true knowledge of it. When the practitioner’s effort reaches the extreme of emptiness and the utmost stillness, the primordial chaos is about to separate, and the single numinous yang of the primordial emerges from the void like dew or lightning. This is the heavenly mechanism openly revealed. One must swiftly turn the Mysterious Pass and secretly store this single numinous yang, preventing its further leakage—this is called 'gathering the medicine and returning to the pot.' What must not be leaked is the instruction to send it back to the earthen cauldron and seal it firmly.\"\n\nThe true import of \"the heavenly mechanism must not be leaked\" cannot be conveyed through words or writing. Know that even if words and writing align with the marvels of the Dao, they remain but a painted moon—not the true moon itself.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Then what of the saying that Master Ziyang’s three transmissions to the unworthy brought three heavenly punishments—is this true or not?\"\n\nThe reply: \"Master Niquan has already clarified this. The Perfected Bai’s *Treatise on Dispelling Delusion* states: ‘Those who study immortality in the world are many, yet most fail to meet a true teacher, or having met one, do not practice, or having practiced, do not persevere. By the time they grow old, they resign themselves to death beneath the Nine Springs—how tragic! Now, if I were to carve the master’s oral instructions into wood and transmit them to the world, fearing the leakage of the heavenly mechanism, would I not incur punishment?’ Master Niquan said: ‘I seek to enlighten all immortals under heaven. If I am to be condemned for this, would Heaven itself not be Heaven? The scripture says: *My life is in my own hands, not in Heaven’s*—what punishment could there be?’ Master Yuchan asked: ‘Why then did Ancestor Zhang Pingshu suffer three calamities after three transmissions to the unworthy?’ Master Niquan replied: ‘That was due to his own lack of discernment at the time, and even more, his failure to extend his intention universally.’ Know that Pingshu’s misfortunes arose from his own self-aggrandizement and had nothing to do with Heaven. How then can one doubt Niquan’s words?\"\n\n145. The Mechanism of the Mind and the Mechanism of the Eye.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing*, though not authored by the Yellow Emperor, is an ancient Daoist text. Its *Upper Scroll* states: “Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism.” Its *Lower Scroll* states: “The mechanism lies in the eye.” This principle of the mechanism of the mind and the mechanism of the eye was once expounded by my master, Body-of-Truth Mountain Man, who said:\n\n“The mechanism is the pivot of movement and stillness. The scripture says: ‘Where the eye reaches, the mind reaches also. Yet where the mind reaches, the eye reaches also.’ Another scripture says: ‘If the eye does not move, the mind abides; if the mind does not move, the eye also abides.’ This mechanism, when external, is the eye; when internal, it is the mind. One must know that mind and breath are interdependent—when this interdependence reaches the point where breathing ceases, one attains perfect serenity and great stillness. As Ancestor Lü said: ‘Learn death before you die.’ The interdependence of mind and breath is the method of learning death. To learn death is to make the mind die. Once the mind is dead, the eye too will not move. One must know that when the eyelids do not move, it is because the interdependence of mind and breath has reached its ultimate state. Thus it is said: ‘The mechanism lies in the eye.’”\n\nThis may be called an elucidation of what has never been elucidated through the ages—it is perfect, complete, and beyond further addition.\n\n---\n\n**146. The Mechanism of Return and the Mechanism of Cessation**\n\nFrom delusion to awakening is called *return*; to revert to the root and return to the source is also called *return*. Since the beginningless beginning, I have transmigrated through kalpas, solely because I turned away from awakening and merged with dust, following things as they turned—like a prodigal son wandering to the ends of the earth, forgetting how to return home and recognize his father, to inherit the family estate. Now, suddenly awakening to past errors, I abruptly change course, devote myself to the study of nature and life, and through realizing nature, restore life. This single thought of turning the mind is called *initial awakening*. With the pure mind of initial awakening, one reflects inward into the *qi*-cavern, calming and stilling it to merge with the breath. Over time, spirit congeals and breath abides; effortlessly, one enters samadhi. Over time, one becomes profoundly still, the six senses utterly empty, a single thought of non-doing, cutting off the ten directions—this is called the *mechanism of cessation*. The mechanism of cessation is the forgetting of mechanism. An ancient worthy said: “Forgetting mechanism exalts the Buddha Way.” Little does one know that the immortal’s path also values the forgetting of mechanism—forgetting form, forgetting things, forgetting *qi*, forgetting spirit, forgetting illumination, forgetting knowledge—all returning to primordial chaos. The more one forgets, the more numinous one becomes, until both person and dharma are empty, both mind and realm are quiescent. Quiescence upon quiescence—then the sacred embryo is perfected, and the Dao transcends all images.\n\nAncestor Lü said:\n*“Sitting or lying, forgetting mechanism, the sword’s shadow stands alone—*\n*One point of numinous essence merges with the elixir furnace.”*\nHe also said:\n*“Pine winds intoxicate me, twofold forgetting of mechanism—*\n*Carving cloud-root, barely half a span.”*\nAnd again:\n*“Ceasing thoughts, forgetting mechanism, merging with spontaneity.”*\nAll these are the wondrous principles of the mechanism of cessation.\n\n---\n\n**147. Possessing Conditions and Possessing Virtue**\n\n*Conditions* refer to the circumstances for cultivating the Dao. The Mysterious School holds that the four—method, wealth, companions, and place—must be complete before the Daoist enterprise can be accomplished. The Tiantai School’s *Zhiguan* requires the possession of five conditions. What are these five?\n1. Sufficient clothing and food;\n2. Pure observance of precepts;\n3. Secluded and quiet dwelling;\n4. Cessation of all conditioned affairs;\n5. Proximity to a good spiritual guide.\n\nThe so-called *conditioned affairs* are further divided into four kinds: livelihood affairs, social obligations, skill and learning affairs—all of which should be relinquished. Moreover, *good spiritual guides* are of three types: external protectors, fellow practitioners, and teaching masters. This aligns perfectly with the Mysterious School’s fourfold requirement of method, wealth, companions, and place.\n\nHowever, even if conditions are met but virtue is lacking, various demonic obstacles will arise, hindering the practitioner’s progress, and the Daoist enterprise may still be difficult to accomplish. Thus, possessing virtue is even more urgent than possessing conditions. As *Zhuangzi* said: “Virtue is the cultivation of harmony and completion.” Perfected One Hidden-in-Void said: “In the external elixir’s path, initiation depends on the person, completion on Heaven, knowledge on wisdom, congealment on blessing, transmission on the master, and clarity on the eye—none of which can be borrowed from others even by a hair’s breadth. If one can cultivate virtue in seclusion, secretly unite like-minded companions, move Heaven and Earth with virtue, and move ghosts and spirits with sincerity, then when approaching the furnace, one can be assured of no mishaps. Otherwise, even with correct methods and a clear mind and eye, how can one withstand demonic trials? I have personally tested and verified this; now I dare not conceal it.” Though this refers to the cultivation of the earthly elixir, the human elixir’s method is no exception.\n\nThus, the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n*“The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—*\n*Know that it depends on me and also on Heaven.*\n*If one has not accumulated deeds and bestowed hidden virtue,*\n*At every turn, hordes of demons will create obstructive conditions.”*\n\nPerfected One Hidden-in-Void’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Hidden virtue is what others do not know. Master Upper Yang’s *Record* says: giving without seeking repayment is hidden virtue; accumulating good without others knowing, not pushing others into danger, secretly doing acts of kindness—all are hidden virtue. The scripture says: ‘When misfortune comes to them, I return with blessing; when resentment comes to them, I return with virtue.’ Immortal Master Hao the Ancient said: ‘Manifest virtue subdues people; hidden virtue subdues demons.’”\n\nI say: *Baopuzi* states: “The immortal’s method desires love to extend to the lowly and the wriggling, not harming any breathing being. The immortal’s method desires love to pervade the eight wilds, seeing others as oneself.” It also says: “Someone asked: Should those who cultivate the Dao first establish merit and virtue? Is this correct? *Baopuzi* replied: Yes. According to the *Jade Bell Scripture*: ‘Establishing merit is foremost; eliminating transgressions is secondary.’ For those who cultivate the Dao, saving people from danger, enabling them to avoid calamity, protecting them from illness, preventing them from dying unjustly—these are the highest merits.”\n\nThose who seek immortality must take loyalty, filial piety, harmony, and compliance as their foundation, with benevolence and trustworthiness as their root. If one does not cultivate virtue but merely pursues techniques, one will not attain longevity.” It also states: “I further suspect that those like Master Peng have not accumulated sufficient merit, and thus cannot ascend to heaven.” This precisely reveals the essentials of possessing virtue. Daoist adepts of the Mysterious School who wish to realize the truth in this very body must first transform their minds, constantly harboring thoughts of benefiting others—bestowing great joy with compassion, and relieving suffering with great mercy—practicing expedient means at all times and broadly accumulating good affinities. Then, those who have not yet met a teacher will meet one, and those who have already met a teacher will attain the Dao. Laozi said: “The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality; it always aligns with the good.” This is what it means.\n\n**148. Equanimity and Calming the Breath**\nMaster Sengchan’s *Inscription on Faith in Mind* states: “One kind of equanimity—all distinctions vanish of themselves.” When Chan Master Liaoshan Gaoyao re-visited Master Boshan, Boshan asked: “After years away, what have you gained?” Gaoyao replied: “Only equanimity.” These two words, “equanimity,” are profoundly subtle yet not easily attained. For unless one reaches the state where wisdom and circumstances merge, where self and others become one, one cannot grasp it. Beginners in the Dao, unable to forget circumstances, how can they achieve equanimity? If equanimity is not yet attainable, first calm the breath. Calming the breath means the mind and breath interdepend, refined to purity, even and gentle, continuous and unbroken. When the breath is calm, the mind is also calm! If, in the midst of intense anger, one can instantly turn the light inward and, within three to five breaths, enter the state of profound obscurity, this gradually aligns with the principle of equanimity. *Zhuangzi* says: “Rest in the harmony of Heaven,” illustrating the subtlety of equanimity. Master Huzǐ’s “balancing the qi mechanism” reveals the subtlety of calming the breath. “Harmony” means balance; “balance” also means equilibrium—the state of undifferentiated chaos without inner or outer.\n\n**149. Peaceful Dwelling and Peace of Mind**\n*Mozi* said: “It is not that there is no peaceful dwelling, but no peace of mind; not that there is no sufficient wealth, but no contentment of heart.” Upon reading this, I could not help but exclaim in delight: How closely his words resemble those of the Old Master! Laozi said: “Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no danger.” He also said: “No sin is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is everlasting contentment.” This can mutually elucidate *Mozi*’s words. As for the method of peace of mind, it is universally esteemed by the Three Teachings. Regulating the breath and concentrating the spirit, stilling both body and mind, dwelling in tranquility and emptiness—what *Zhuangzi* calls “letting the mind wander in the origin of things”—is the method of peace of mind in the Mysterious School. The *Book of Changes* says: “The sage uses this to cleanse the mind and retreat into secrecy.” Yangzi said: “Conceal the mind in the abyss to beautify its spiritual root.” This is the Confucian method of peace of mind. The Second Patriarch Huike said to Bodhidharma: “My mind is not at peace; I beg you, Master, to pacify it.” Bodhidharma replied: “Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it.” After a long while, Huike said: “I have searched for the mind but cannot find it.” Bodhidharma said: “I have pacified your mind.” This is the Chan method of peace of mind. Chan is the most transcendent, yet not something beginners can suddenly grasp. Only those who have seen the Buddha as if face-to-face can attain the emptiness of mind. Seeking a method that is simple, accessible, and universally applicable to all roots, none surpasses the Old Master’s method of peace of mind—concentrating the spirit in emptiness and harmonizing it with the breath. When the breath is regulated, the mind becomes still; with prolonged stillness, one naturally enters samadhi. In this samadhi, body and mind become light and at ease, the hundred bones are harmonized, worldly burdens gradually dissolve, and wisdom daily increases. Thus, *Liezi* says: “Nothing surpasses stillness; nothing surpasses emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these are where one abides. Grasping and giving—these are what one loses.” This is the essential principle of the Mysterious School’s Complete Reality, the ultimate key to returning to life.\n\n**150. Perceiving the Unique and Doubting the Unique**\n*Zhuangzi* said: “Only after perceiving the Unique can one transcend past and present; only by transcending past and present can one enter the realm of neither death nor life.” *Liezi* said: “Those who do not arise doubt the Unique; those who do not transform cycle between going and returning. The boundary of going and returning cannot be exhausted; the Dao of doubting the Unique cannot be fathomed.” Explanation: The Dharma-eye of the mind-ground, able to perceive the Dharma-body, is called perceiving the Unique. The Unique is the truth without dependence. The Dharma-nature is non-dual and does not accompany the myriad dharmas, hence it is called Unique. Hanshanzi said: “Precious is the natural thing, standing alone without companions.” *Laozi* said: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change, circulating without end.” All these illustrate the meaning of non-dependence, hence it is called the body of absolute truth. All phenomena of life and death, day and night, light and dark, form and emptiness belong to duality. Perceiving the Unique transcends the two extremes, merging into oneness, thus enabling one to transcend past and present and enter the realm of neither death nor life. The “doubt” in doubting the Unique shares the same meaning as the “doubt” in *Zhuangzi*’s “doubting the beginning.” It means using true nature to encompass all dharmas, uniting root and branches in the source, yet the source itself is not established. Thus, neither the Unique nor the non-Unique need be clung to. This means that even the perception of the Unique is cast off, not lingering on the Dharma-body. Profound indeed!\n\n**151. Seeing Simplicity and Embodying Simplicity**\n*Laozi* said: “See simplicity and embrace the uncarved block.” *Zhuangzi* said: “Simplicity means having nothing mixed with it.”\n\n\"Purity\" means its spirit remains unblemished; \"to embody purity and simplicity\" is called the *zhenren* (True Person).\" Nan Yue Huai Chan Master said: \"Cultivation and realization are not absent, yet defilement cannot reach it.\" The Sixth Patriarch affirmed this, saying: \"This very non-defilement is what all buddhas cherish and protect. Since you are thus, so too am I.\"\n\nCommentary: Simplicity is the original scenery of the fundamental ground, the inherent nature of the source. The Daoist sages' \"seeing simplicity\" means penetrating to the inherent nature of the source. *Zhuangzi*'s \"embodying purity and simplicity\" likewise clarifies this undefiled, pure nature-body. Both the Mysterious School and Chan School take the attainment of this original scenery as their ultimate goal, as can be verified. As for \"embracing the uncarved block,\" this corresponds to what the Chan tradition calls \"preserving and maintaining.\" \"Seeing simplicity and embracing the uncarved block\" is the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye of the Daoist lineage. The cultivation of the Mysterious School may be said to correspond most closely with the supreme vehicle of the Buddha’s teaching. Thus, Great Pearl Chan Master said: \"Those of great capacity use it and find it the same; those of small capacity cling to it and find it different.\" Differences in capacity and insight give rise to the Three Teachings, but delusion and awakening lie with the person, not with the differences or similarities of the teachings.\n\n**152. Inheriting Constancy and Inheriting Illumination**\n*Laozi* said: \"Use its light and return to illumination; leave no misfortune for the self—this is called inheriting constancy.\" He also said: \"Good conduct leaves no tracks; good speech bears no flaws; good calculation requires no counting rods; good closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened; good binding uses no cords yet cannot be untied. Thus the sage always excels at saving people, so none are abandoned; always excels at saving things, so none are discarded—this is called inheriting illumination.\"\n\nThe Daoist sages expounded the principles of inheriting constancy and inheriting illumination to guide people in realizing the Dharma-body of constancy. This Dharma-body of constancy is the wondrously luminous, inherently awakened nature of all beings. Whether called \"constancy\" or \"illumination,\" their meaning is not two. \"Inheriting\" means to continue, that is, to inwardly merge with the original mind and silently accord with the Dao of true constancy. Though this is not something ordinary people can comprehend, it is also not separate from their daily activities. If one can turn inward and seek it, one may suddenly awaken to the mind-source and open the eye of sagely wisdom. The danger lies in beings using their light yet failing to return to illumination in their daily lives.\n\nWhat does it mean to \"use one's light\"? Changqing An said: \"Each of you possesses a great treasure. From the eye-gate, light radiates to illuminate mountains, rivers, and the great earth; from the ear-gate, light radiates to encompass all sounds. Thus, the six gates ceaselessly emit light day and night—this is called the *Samādhi of Radiant Light*, yet one fails to recognize it.\" The Daoist sages return to illumination precisely to guide people back to the mind-source. Just as recognizing the lamp’s light leads to the lamp itself, illumination then continues without end.\n\nThe five lines beginning with *\"Virtuous action leaves no trace\"* reveal the wondrous functioning of inherent nature, free from contrivance. The four lines beginning with *\"Ever skillfully saving others\"* reveal the vow of great compassion, one with all beings. For those who perfectly realize the One Mind, self and other are not separate, and self and things are without barrier. Thus, their response to suffering is as if their own—seeing others drowning as if they themselves were drowning, they cannot help but skillfully save and deliver.\n\n---\n\n**Great Compliance and Great Tranquility**\nThe Daoist sages said: *\"Profound is the mysterious virtue, distant indeed! It moves contrary to things, yet attains Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter states: *\"When nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin. When virtue reaches this, it becomes one with the beginning. This oneness is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Merging with the cries of all things, it harmonizes with heaven and earth. This harmony is subtle, appearing foolish or dull—this is called mysterious virtue, one with Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *\"Lie Yukou\"* chapter further says: *\"The perfected person returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in the realm of nothing-whatsoever. Like water flowing without form, it diffuses into the great purity. Alas! You know the fine but not the great tranquility.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *Great Tranquility* is the realm of effortless stability, the land of the subtle and formless, the boundless expanse of the supreme mystery—free from disaster, harm, entanglement, or sorrow, the utmost auspiciousness. Only when emotions are forgotten and views extinguished, when one suddenly awakens and realizes this, may one be said to correspond to it. In initial practice, if one can sit in stillness for three hours without external breath, this may be called a partial correspondence. In short, before body and mind attain great samādhi, there can be no talk of *Great Tranquility*. Only with samādhi does tranquility arise.\n\n*Great Compliance* is the great naturalness. There is the *Great Compliance of Qi-transformation*—the transformations of fire and seasons, purely spontaneous, wondrously accordant with the primordial, like the butcher’s carving of the ox or the hunchback’s catching of the cicada. There is also the *Great Compliance of Spirit-transformation*—where environment and wisdom merge perfectly, and the mind turns freely without obstruction, as with the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s ten-stage bodhisattvas, who attain mastery over mind and dharma, their thoughts manifesting unfathomable spiritual transformations with boundless subtlety. This is the ultimate *Great Compliance*! Yet without returning to the utmost emptiness and merging with the Dao, one cannot easily reach this realm.\n\n---\n\n**Mysterious Virtue and Mysterious Sameness**\nThe Daoist sages said: *\"The Dao is revered, virtue is noble—nothing commands them, yet they are ever spontaneous. Thus, the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures; it rears, raises, matures, ripens, nourishes, and shelters. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called mysterious virtue.\"*\n\nThey also said: *\"Profound is the mysterious virtue, distant indeed! It moves contrary to things, yet attains Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"When nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin. When virtue reaches this, it becomes one with the beginning. This oneness is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Merging with the cries of all things, it harmonizes with heaven and earth. This harmony is subtle, appearing foolish or dull—this is called mysterious virtue, one with Great Compliance.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Both Laozi and Zhuangzi expound *mysterious virtue*. *Mysterious virtue* is the cultivation of the Dao, another name for the ever-abiding true mind. Only by returning to the beginningless can one realize *mysterious virtue*. When mind and breath interdepend, and true emptiness manifests, this may be called *\"when nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin.\"* The lines *\"acts yet does not rely\"* and so on describe the wondrousness of responding without intention, achieving without dwelling. If there is self, there is a beginning; if there is selfishness, there is no universality. Thus, to realize *mysterious virtue* is to embrace all things without intention, to follow events without attachment—like a mirror reflecting images, the sun shining, the wind moving, responding to things and letting them go without claiming merit.\n\nThe Daoist sages, having expounded *mysterious virtue*, further expound *mysterious sameness*. The scripture says: *\"Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, harmonize the light, merge with the dust—this is called mysterious sameness. Thus, it cannot be approached or estranged; it cannot be benefited or harmed; it cannot be exalted or debased. Therefore, it is honored by all under heaven.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *Mysterious sameness* means turning the myriad streams to merge into the mysterious, dwelling in the wondrous without duality. As in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *\"Entry into the Dharma Realm\"* chapter, the fifty-three spiritual friends each teach distinct Dharma gates, yet all dissolve into self-nature and attain liberation. Liberation is the same, yet the gates differ; equality appears within difference, and difference manifests within equality. Thus, one who masters the function of *mysterious sameness* can manifest differentiated forms within undifferentiated reality, enter undifferentiated samādhi within differentiated forms, reveal differentiated realms within undifferentiated samādhi, and demonstrate undifferentiated wisdom within differentiated realms—wondrously entering the *Avataṃsaka*’s gate of unimpeded liberation.\n\nMaster Jì of Cáoshān established the *Three Kinds of Falling*. The adept of *mysterious sameness* can be at ease anywhere—this is *following the falling*. Moving freely according to kind—this is *kindred falling*. For example, after attaining the Dao, Immortal Chén Cuìxū carried a shoulder-pole to make barrels for others, singing in the marketplace: *\"The leaky teaching, the leakless—how does the water flow through?\"*\n\nOnce the perfect and subtle is realized, \"inner and outer become one true emptiness.\" Is this not akin to the *Avataṃsaka*’s Incense-Selling Elder and the Ferryman Vasu, who guided beings with skillful means?\n\nWhile Yǎngshān was sweeping the ground, Wéishān asked: “Dust cannot be swept away, and emptiness does not arise on its own. What is meant by ‘dust cannot be swept away’?” Yǎngshān swept the ground once. Wéishān then asked: “What is meant by ‘emptiness does not arise on its own’?” Yǎngshān pointed to himself and then to Wéishān. Wéishān said: “If dust cannot be swept away and emptiness does not arise on its own, then apart from this path, what else can be done?” Yǎngshān swept the ground once more, then pointed to himself and again to Wéishān.\n\nWhile Línjì was planting pines, Huángbò asked: “Why plant so many pines deep in the mountains?” Línjì replied: “First, to adorn the mountain gate; second, to serve as a signpost for later generations.” Having spoken, he struck the ground three times with his hoe. Huángbò said: “Though you say so, you have already received my thirty blows.” Línjì struck the ground three more times and let out a long *xū*. Huángbò then declared: “Our lineage will flourish greatly through you.”\n\nIn this way, not a single dharma fails to be mysteriously identical with the mundane, the conventional, and the real—revolving through the ten thousand currents, all enter the gate of non-duality, wondrously accordant with the principle of non-arising.\n\nThe wonder of *mysterious sameness* has two aspects:\nFirst, traces may be the same while functions differ.\nSecond, traces may differ while functions remain the same.\n\nFor example, in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s fifty-three visits to good spiritual friends within the realm of reality, some appear as bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, some as kings or householders, some as immortals or non-Buddhist practitioners, and even as boys or girls. Though their circumstances—whether favorable or adverse, provisional or real—vary, their reliance on the abode of Vairocana’s dharma is one. This is what is meant by *traces differing while functions remain the same*.\n\nMaster Qiánxū of the Hidden Void said: “My sameness is sameness with the mysterious, not sameness with traces.” This illustrates the point.\n\nAs for *traces being the same while functions differ*, this embodies the principle of harmony without dissipation. For instance, both the awakened and the unawakened may sleep, sit, see, hear, eat, and drink in the same way, yet their realms are vastly different. Take sleep, for example: the perfected one remains the same whether awake or asleep, while the ordinary person’s spirit and soul are inverted, their dreams chaotic as mountains. Or consider those who have not cultivated practice—their breath roars like thunder in sleep, and their spirit and breath do not guard each other. But those who have long cultivated practice, when they sleep, their mind and breath depend on each other, their nasal breath silent, as if entering samādhi. This is what the sūtras call the “samādhi of lying down.” When ordinary people enter the realm of sounds and forms, they are turned by them, but the sage is not. This is what is meant by *traces being the same while functions differ*.\n\n---\n\n**155. Knowing Glory and Guarding Humility**\nThe ancient sage said: “Know its glory, guard its humility, and become the valley of the world. As the valley of the world, the constant virtue is fulfilled, and one returns to simplicity.”\n\nExplanation: Glory and humility are metaphorical expressions, ultimately pointing to body and mind. The mind’s essence is vast, embracing the ten thousand images—this is the ever-abiding true mind, the inherently pure and luminous substance, unchanging through kalpas, utterly transcendent. This is the image of glory. The four great elements of the physical body are a temporary aggregation, impure and turbid—this is the image of humility.\n\nIf one forgets the body and unites the mind with the breath, empties all that exists, and harmonizes mind and breath, forgetting both glory and humility, gradually attaining great tranquility, then inner and outer both become empty, forming a circle ○. This image is called the “hollow center,” the valley of the world.\n\nWhen body and mind are both forgotten and the roots and dust are extinguished, the primordial true yang qi surges through the passes to the crown, embracing the dharma-body and nurturing the physical form, nourishing both inner and outer. Body and mind become one, guest and host merge, form and emptiness unite, equality without duality, wondrously accordant with thusness. The constant virtue is fulfilled. The six consciousnesses forgotten, the three poisons extinguished, one returns to the primordial chaos, where being and non-being are not established, and neither the realms of sage nor ordinary can contain it. This is the ultimate return to the source.\n\nAlas! What surpasses this in the wonder of returning to simplicity?\n\n---\n\n**156. Spontaneous Arising and Conditioned Arising**\n*Spontaneous arising* depends on the original source of self-nature, arising naturally and effortlessly. The ancient sage said: “Good conduct leaves no tracks, good planning requires no schemes, good closure has no bolts yet cannot be opened, good binding has no cords yet cannot be untied.”\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* said: “Neither this nor that can be deemed odd or even—this is called the pivot of the Dao. Only when the pivot is at the center of the ring can it respond endlessly.” He also said: “The clan of Rǎnxiàng attained the center of the ring and followed its completion, harmonizing with things without beginning or end, without near or far.” And again: “The perfected one’s mind is like a mirror—neither grasping nor rejecting, responding without concealing, thus able to master things without harm.” This is the teaching of spontaneous arising in the traditions of Lǎozǐ and Zhuāngzǐ.\n\nIn Buddhism, only the Chán and Huáyán schools speak of spontaneous arising; all other schools teach *conditioned arising*. The dharmas of conditioned arising are a mixture of truth and delusion, hence distinctions of defilement and purity arise. But self-nature is purely true, without delusion, pure and undefiled, responding to things without attachment, universally compliant without partiality. Though adorned with the ten thousand practices, not a single dust arises—only this is noble.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, there is a bodhisattva named Wondrous Virtue of the Tathāgata’s Spontaneous Arising. Moreover, the adornments of the Flower Treasury World are all the great manifestations of the wondrous virtue of spontaneous arising. In the *Entering the Realm of Reality* chapter, Vasumitrā’s traces appear licentious, yet whether she licks, kisses, embraces, grasps, gazes, or touches, she enables beings to be liberated from emotional bondage and attain great benefit. This reveals the great function of the Tathāgata’s wondrous virtue of spontaneous arising. Since spontaneous arising is effortless, it can transform things.\n\nDependent arising follows things, thus is turned by them.\nTurned by things, one sees things yet does not see the mind.\nThe wondrous action of non-action is ever dynamic, ever quiescent.\n\nMoreover, the spontaneous arising of nature reveals the solitary truth alone;\ndependent arising gives rise to the six senses’ conditioned blaze.\nSpontaneous arising allows events to merge with principle, mind and realm dissolved;\ndependent arising engages subject and object, knowledge and perception proliferating—\nunable to attain purity, tranquility, or unity, as is only natural.\n\nThe Mysterious School’s Dharma-gate of spontaneous arising accords with the *Avataṃsaka*’s teaching of the Tathāgata’s wondrous virtue of spontaneous arising.\nThus the ancient sage said: “The Dao gives them birth; virtue nurtures them.”\nDependent arising mixes purity and defilement; spontaneous arising holds purity without defilement—\nhence the ancient sage said: “Purity is the norm of the world.”\nDependent arising clings to mind, for subject and object have not perished;\nspontaneous arising has no clinging mind, for subject and object do not arise.\nThus the ancient sage said: “It gives birth yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, matures yet does not dominate—this is called mysterious virtue.”\n\nDependent arising establishes measure, inner and outer unmerged;\nspontaneous arising transcends all measure, revealing the inexhaustible.\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: “Embodying the boundless, roaming without trace, without inner or outer, without beginning or end, without limit or time.”\nDependent arising belongs to duality; spontaneous arising belongs to non-duality—\nhence *Zhuangzi* says: “The Dao unites as one.”\nAnd again: “Knowledge unites as one.”\nAnd: “The myriad things neither complete nor destroy, returning to unity.”\nAnd: “After thirty thousand years, they form a single purity.”\nThe ancient sage said: “When united as one, the myriad things are complete.”\nAnd again: “The sage embraces the One, serving as the world’s model.”\n\nThus the Mysterious School’s Dao fuses and pervades, the solitary truth alone revealed—\nspanning past and present, manifesting perfect completion, dissolving self and other into unity.\nWere one not of the highest wisdom, few would not sigh in awe.\n\nThe general outline of the Mysterious School and Chan School’s Dharma-gate of spontaneous arising is as above.\nMay I ask: what is its great function?\nIt is answered: emptiness, quiescence, and spontaneity—purity, tranquility, and unity.\nIts wondrous aspect may be encompassed by the ancient sage’s two phrases:\n“Non-action yet nothing left undone” and “Acting without acting.”\nThe Chan School calls this the “Dao of no effort.”\n\nBy “non-action yet nothing left undone,” it is ever quiescent, ever dynamic;\nby “acting without acting,” it is ever dynamic, ever quiescent.\nEver quiescent yet ever dynamic, thus dwelling in non-being, nothing is not non-being;\never dynamic yet ever quiescent, thus abiding in being, nothing is being.\nDwelling in non-being, nothing is not non-being—hence the great function flourishes, and the myriad virtues manifest.\nAbiding in being, nothing is being—hence sagely wisdom fuses in emptiness, not a single dust arises.\n\nAs the *Treatise of Sengzhao* says: “Responsive transformation is boundless, yet it has never acted; quiescent and unmoving, yet it has never ceased acting.”\nAnd again: “Not exhausting action, not abiding in non-action.”\nThis is truly the wondrous function of spontaneous arising, the profound practice of prajñā.\nChan and the Mysterious interpenetrate; the thousand sages share the same path.\nThough its dust and chaff may seem insignificant, they suffice to mold the likes of Yao and Shun.\n\nIn Buddhism, the Hīnayāna relies on karmic dependent arising;\nthe Yogācāra school relies on the dependent arising of the eight consciousnesses;\nthe Three Treatises school relies on the dependent arising of true suchness;\nthe Esoteric school relies on the dependent arising of the six great elements.\nThe Tiantai school speaks only of nature-possession, not nature-arising—\nnature-possession remains the tathāgatagarbha in bondage, whereas nature-arising reveals the wondrous function of the unobstructed true suchness.\n\nIn Chan, raising a fist or lifting a whisk, carrying water or moving firewood—\nnone are not the supreme truth.\nEven a single staff-strike or shout can instantly open the wise one’s eye of wisdom,\ninstantly realizing the patience of non-arising—all the wondrousness of spontaneous arising.\n*Zhuangzi*’s “acting without one” is likewise of this kind.\n\n---\n\n**Birth-and-death and death-and-birth**\n\nThe *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* says: “All conditioned things are impermanent; this is the Dharma of birth-and-death.”\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “All conditioned things are impermanent; the nature of thought is unborn and undying.”\nAll teachings speak of birth-and-death, yet only the Chan and Mysterious Schools reveal death-and-birth.\n\nAs Chan Master Yuanwu said: “Leap from the precipice, willingly take responsibility; revive after absolute death—no deceiving the sovereign.”\nThe Chan tradition often speaks of “great death, great life”—this is the wondrous principle of death-and-birth.\n\nThe Mysterious School’s *Cantong Qi* says: “When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate and succeed; the embodied dragon revives.”\nAnd: “The number of one and nine ends and begins anew; containing the primordial, empty and perilous, it scatters essence into the child.”\nAnd: “From darkness to dawn, thunder arrives to receive the tally.”\nAnd: “Concealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void; when metal restores its original nature, the cauldron’s radiance blazes.”\nAnd: “When qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest the death of the po and hun; the color shifts to purple, resplendently forming the returned elixir.”\n\nThis too reveals the wondrous principle of death-and-birth.\nBirth then death is the forward course;\ndeath then birth is the reverse turning—the mysterious mechanism of returning to life, the esoteric mystery of the elixir school.\n\nTo grasp the mysterious mechanism of death-and-birth and return to life,\none must first recognize the “empty space beyond the body”—this is where I am born.\nOnly by dying where one is born can one avoid falling into emptiness.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: “Know the white, guard the black—spirit and brightness will come of themselves.”\nIf one does not recognize the birthplace and merely seeks stillness, ceasing thoughts, with mind extinguished and will dissolved,\none falls into withered Chan and barren emptiness—spirit and brightness do not come, not the realm where “the withered tree sings like a dragon.”\n\nThus Confucius said: “Without knowing life, how can one know death?”\n\nDongshan said: “On withered trees, flowers bloom in a spring beyond kalpas; riding backward on a jade elephant, one chases the qilin.” This reveals the wonder of dying-and-living. The *Book of Changes*’ hexagrams *Bo* and *Fu* follow one another, conveying the same meaning. Likewise, the image of the *Ge* hexagram: the *Book of Changes* states, “Water and fire mutually extinguish.” Through mutual extinction, *Ge* is formed—this takes the meaning of extinction giving rise to life. Great death, great life—this is precisely the wonder of dying-and-living. The *Great Learning* says: “Things have roots and branches; affairs have ends and beginnings.” It does not speak of “beginning and end,” but of “end and beginning,” which also accords with the meaning of *Bo* and *Fu* following one another. Thus, the Daoist, Chan, and Confucian traditions—all reverse the current to emerge from the sea of birth and death—all grasp the esoteric principle of dying-and-living.\n\n**The Small Self and the Great Self**\nZhuangzi said: “The perfected person has no self.” He also said: “In great sameness, there is no self.” This “no self” means only the absence of the small self, not the absence of the great self. The small self is the deluded attachment of sentient beings to this seven-foot body as “I.” The great self is the true self, the great Dharma-body. The ancient sages called it the “Great Image”; Zhuangzi called it the “Great One.” Master Donghua said: “The Dharma-body is vast and firm, pervading heaven and earth; the true nature is perfectly luminous, spanning past and present.” Master Heyang said: “I ask myself, who am I? Not knowing the true self, one vainly seeks truth. How could one know that the Great One contains the primordial beginning, penetrating earth and heaven as one body?” All these refer to the great self. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* sets forth the four virtues of permanence, bliss, self, and purity. The “self” here also refers to the great self, the Dharma-body. Thus the sutra says: “Because there is the great self, it is called the great *nirvāṇa*.” Chan Master Shoushan said: “In a silver world, a golden body—sentient and insentient share one truth.” Chan Master Xiaoshou said: “Mountains, rivers, and the great earth fully reveal the Dharma-king’s body.” The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “Only the one solid, dense body manifests in every speck of dust.” The *Great Comprehension Sūtra* says: “Suchness is natural, boundlessly vast.” All these illustrate the meaning of the great self. The small self is like a single bubble in the sea; the great self is the pure, vast ocean. Once the attachment to the body is shattered, the seventh consciousness transforms, the small self dissolves, and the great self manifests—mind and realm become one, self and other are undivided.\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: “The true heart is vast and boundless; infinite immortals emerge from within. Worldly people cling to the small form; the single pearl of mystery, people do not recognize.” The “small form” refers to the physical body, the small self. The “true heart vast and boundless” refers to the great self, the Dharma-body. The *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: “All sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been variously inverted, mistakenly recognizing the four great elements as the form of their own bodies, and the shadows of the six sense-fields as the form of their own minds.” The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “It is like abandoning a hundred thousand clear seas and recognizing only a single bubble as the whole tide, exhausting the vast ocean—you are the awakened among the deluded.” This rebukes the inversion of clinging to the physical body as the small self. The Confucian practice of “overcoming the self” is precisely overcoming this small self. When “all under heaven returns to benevolence,” the original face of *Qian* appears, and the great self, the great Dharma-body, is revealed.\n\nThe Ming Confucian Zhao Dazhou’s *Admonition on Overcoming the Self* says: “I have a great self, which looks down upon the myriad things and observes heaven and earth. If the great self is not pervaded, the small self stands alone. Once the small self is overcome, the great self flows freely. The ancients who were good at overcoming the self saw the formless and heard the soundless. Their movements left no tracks; their words were not mere quotations. The four functions returned to the one; the one truth flowed freely. Without form or direction, ritual was refined and flourished. If one has even a slight intention, stubbornness, or attachment to the self, the wondrous function becomes stagnant, leading to paralysis—this is not benevolence, but clinging to the small self. Thus, ‘no self’ is overcoming; the ‘true self’ is great. The greatest is benevolence, embodying no duality. Without seeing great and small, how can one know inner and outer? Realizing this is called sagehood; next is worthiness. The foolish cling and grasp.”\n\nI note that the sages of the Three Teachings all teach people to empty the small self and realize the great self. In the Daoist tradition, the practice lies in the interdependence of the heart and breath beyond the body. Through extreme dependence, one transforms and enters great samādhi, merging with true emptiness—this is precisely abandoning the small to pursue the great, dissolving the boundaries of inner and outer, revealing the whole of the one truth. As Master Sanfeng said: “The heart is as vast as the sun and moon; I and heaven-and-earth are inside and out.” And again: “The yang spirit’s wondrous body is one with the great void; a single grain of millet contains heaven and earth.” Master Ziyang said: “Send off the child riding a crane; when empty space shatters, the whole body is seen.” All these reveal the wonder of realizing the great self.\n\nZhuangzi’s “Seven Greats” says: “The Great One unites it; the Great Yin dissolves it; the Great Eye sees it; the Great Balance connects it; the Great Square embodies it; the Great Faith verifies it; the Great Samādhi holds it.” All these are images of the great self. Thus, the ancient worthies of the Chan school said: “The Dharma-realm is I; I am the Dharma-realm.” Those who merely take this seven-foot illusory body as “I,” not knowing to take the Dharma-realm as their body—how could they know the wonder of the great self?\n\n**Nurturing Life and Preserving Life**\nZhuangzi was skilled in discussing nurturing life; Laozi was skilled in discussing preserving life. Zhuangzi said: “The true person of old did not dream in sleep, had no worries when awake, did not relish food, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reached the heels; ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat.”\n\nHe also said: “Following the central channel as one’s guiding principle, one can preserve the body, perfect life, nurture one’s kin, and fulfill one’s years.” This is the essential purport of nurturing life: the primordial harmony circulates within, qi flourishes and spirit is whole.\n\nLaozi said: “Attain utmost emptiness, abide in profound stillness; the myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life; recovering life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity.” He also said: “Return to simplicity, return to infancy, return to nothingness, return to the boundless.” Thus, returning to simplicity means the six dusts do not defile—this is the sublime truth of preserving life.\n\n“Nurturing” means to cultivate and foster; “preserving” means to revolve and return. Revolving through arising and ceasing to enter cessation, proceeding from life after life to accord with non-arising, one returns to the true boundlessness, the image before the Lord of Creation.\n\nLaozi said: “Coming forth into life, entering into death: of those who follow life, ten or three; of those who follow death, ten or three; of those whose lives move them toward the realm of death, also ten or three. Why is this so? Because of their excessive clinging to life.”\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully preserve life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being struck by weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and the weapon nowhere to lodge its blade. Why is this so? Because they dwell in no place of death.\n\nThis is what it means to skillfully preserve life: one realizes the true emptiness and no-self, so that neither inner nor outer things can cause harm. Emptiness thus entails no birth, and no birth entails no death. When arising and ceasing are extinguished, quiescent extinction appears—this is the meaning of preserving life, which those who merely nurture life cannot endure. Why? Because those who nurture life have not yet emptied their perception of life, and the attachment to self still remains. Where there is a view of self, there arises a view of others; where there is a view of self, there arises a view of things. Self and things perpetually stand in opposition, and thus the mind cannot remain unmoved. When the self’s mind moves, things’ minds also move (for example, when I intend to catch a fly, the fly immediately takes defensive action. Before my hand reaches the fly, it has already flown away). Thus, the rhinoceros finds a place to thrust its horn, and the tiger finds a place to set its claws.\n\nThose who preserve life maintain an unmoving body and mind, a body and mind in quiescent extinction. Those who nurture life value a broad mind and a relaxed body, with supreme harmony filling their being and the root of life eternally secure. If one comprehends and unifies these approaches, one sees that though preserving and nurturing life differ, their effects are not distinct. The practice is nothing other than the interdependence of mind and breath. When great samādhi is attained, the true yang of heaven and earth arrives unbidden. The body and mind remain unmoving, responsive yet ever quiescent, quiescent yet ever responsive. With this, one may nurture life, and with this, one may also preserve life.\n\n**160. Precelestial and Postcelestial Nurturing of Life**\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao has essence and sincerity, yet is non-actional and formless.”\nGuangchengzi said: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will naturally become upright.”\nKangcangzi said: “My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind harmonizes with my qi, my qi harmonizes with my spirit, and my spirit harmonizes with nothingness.”\nGuanyinzi said: “Unify your nature, nurture your qi, contain your virtue, and engage with things as they are created.”\n\nAll the above discourses take spirit and qi as primary, emptiness and stillness as their function—this is the study of precelestial nurturing of life.\n\nWesterners who pursue hygiene know only six principles: light, heat, water, air, diet, and exercise. They say that light must be sufficient, air must circulate, drinking water must be clean, food must be rich in nourishment, and the body must move often. They also emphasize deep breathing. When they discover microorganisms in water, they use disinfection. When they learn that the human body requires vitamins, they analyze foods containing vitamins A, B, C, and so on, extract their essence, and use it to supplement the diet. All such methods remain postcelestial. They do not know how to extend one’s spirit and qi into the outer emptiness for cultivation, or how to return from the postcelestial to the precelestial.\n\nTrue qi steams and scorches—no heat is more intense than this.\nWisdom-light inwardly radiates, the empty chamber brightens—no light is more brilliant than this.\nHarmony circulates within, the Three Fields are moistened—no qi surges more powerfully than this.\nChan bliss serves as food—no food is more precious than this.\nAmṛta fills the drink—no drink is purer than this.\nThe unmoving movement—movement that never departs from stillness, penetrating the subtle without obstruction—no movement is more wondrous than this.\n\nFalse Dao nurtures the form; true Dao nurtures the spirit.\nThe *Liezi·Huangdi Pian* and *Zhuangzi·Dasheng Pian* both record Guan Yinzi’s teachings on concealing the spirit and guarding qi.\nThis is the profound school’s method of heart and breath interdependent, the spirit submerged in emptiness, merging with the breath to reverse and emerge as wondrous fetal breathing.\nConcentrating qi to attain softness, embracing the One without separation—when spirit is whole and qi is full, the form naturally aligns.\n“To nurture the form, one must first have things, yet there are cases where things are in excess and the form is not nurtured.\nTo have life, one must first not depart from form, yet there are cases where form is not departed from and life is forgotten.\nLife’s coming cannot be refused, death’s going cannot be halted—how lamentable!\nThe world’s people believe that nurturing the form suffices to preserve life, yet if nurturing the form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what is the world worth?”\n\nThose who devote themselves to precelestial nurturing of life:\nTo comprehend the nature of life, one must be empty, still, tranquil, and desireless.\nTo comprehend the nature of destiny, one must conceal the spirit, guard qi, embrace the One, abide in harmony, and attain great samādhi to merge with true emptiness.\nFrom having life, one returns to the original non-life—thus transcending beyond form and image.\nNon-life yet nothing not alive—this is the ultimate in nurturing life.\n\n---\n\n**Precelestial and Postcelestial Investigation of Things**\nWestern science studies the atoms of matter and their dynamics for utilitarian purposes—this is postcelestial investigation of things.\nWhat it employs is the deluded mind.\nDeluded thoughts favor movement, hence all Western inventions—machinery, steamships, trains, automobiles, airplanes, submarines—operate through movement and manifest dynamic states.\n\nOur cultivation of the Dao is precelestial investigation of things.\nWhat it employs is the true mind.\nThe true mind is fundamentally unmoving, taking non-movement as its homecoming.\nThe *Yijing* states: “Still and unmoving.”\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: “Thusness, unmoving.”\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: “Wondrously pure, perfectly contained, the unmoving honored one.”\nThe *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: “Thus, even to the extent of empty space, encompassing the three times, all is equal, pure, and unmoving.” It further states: “Since empty space is thus equal and unmoving, know that the nature of awareness is equal and unmoving. Because the four movements are unmoving, know that the nature of awareness is equal and unmoving. Thus, even to the eighty-four thousand *dhāraṇīs*, all are equal and unmoving—know that the nature of awareness is equal and unmoving.” And again: “Since the nature of awareness pervades and fills, pure and unmoving, boundlessly round, know that the six sense faculties pervade the dharmadhātu.”\nThe *Renwang Huguo Bore Jing* states: “Entering the immovable dharma-stream, forever without segmentation, transcending all existence.”\nZiyang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “Lead and mercury return to true earth; body and mind are still and unmoving.”\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: “The Great One penetrates it; great samādhi sustains it,” and “Without beginning or end, without nearness or time”—all revealing the principle of the nature’s immovability.\n\nBecause it is unmoving, it is perpetually stable; when stability reaches its peak, clarity arises; when clarity reaches its peak, awareness is full. Inwardly, true knowing emerges; outwardly, the dusty realm merges. Mind and realm are thus, boundlessly vast, roundly luminous, and silently illuminating—this is called the Golden Elixir, also known as Perfect Enlightenment.\nThis is the verification of the precelestial investigation of things.\n\nNow, movement is the cause of flux, the gateway of arising and ceasing.\nNon-movement is the cause of quiescence, the gateway of suchness.\nThis is the distinction between Daoist learning and science.\n\nPostcelestial investigation of things establishes knowledge through knowing.\nPrecelestial investigation of things has no seeing in its knowing.\nPostcelestial investigation of things does not transcend the six dusts.\nPrecelestial investigation of things transcends the six dusts.\nPostcelestial investigation of things pits thing against self.\nPrecelestial investigation of things unites thing and self.\nPostcelestial investigation of things is the conditioned-arising dharma-gate.\nPrecelestial investigation of things is the nature-arising dharma-gate.\nPostcelestial investigation of things gives rise to mind with attachment.\nPrecelestial investigation of things gives rise to mind without attachment.\nPostcelestial investigation of things does not transcend the present measure.\nPrecelestial investigation of things transcends the present measure.\n\nThus, all buddhas and sages, through the utmost power of cultivation and realization, all penetrate the one mind, dissolve the myriad existences, exit the abode of the five aggregates, and transcend beyond the ten thousand images—truly, they may be called the dharma-kings, self-mastered in the dharma.\n\n---\n\n**Inner Joy and Outer Joy**\nIn the profound school’s practice, when heart and breath wondrously merge, inner and outer harmonize. Upon reaching the state of indistinct obscurity, breathing becomes faint, and the eighty-four thousand pores all open.\nPrecelestial true yang responds to the summons, enters the body, and irrigates it above and below. The entire body becomes supple, blissful, and delightful—like the harmonious warmth of spring, intoxicating and indescribable.\nThis is called pure and wondrous joy, also known as inner joy.\nThe *Yijing* states: “Stopping and rejoicing—thus it is smooth.” It also states: “Yellow at the center, penetrating the principle, rightly positioned in the body—beauty resides within and flows through the four limbs.” This describes this scene.\nThe Buddhist tradition calls it *chan* bliss, also known as the joy of sacred quiescence, or the bliss of self-awakened sagely wisdom.\nThe *Huayan Song* states: “Of all the joys in the world, the joy of sacred quiescence is supreme.”\nAs for quiescence, only when body and mind are still and settled does inner joy arise—joy within samādhi.\n\nAs for the joys pursued by worldly people—sounds and sights, wealth and profit—these stir the inner heart, inevitably unsettling one’s essence. Lost in their allure, one forgets to return; essence scatters and spirit races, joy turning to sorrow at its peak, and the great life-force follows in its wake. This is called external joy, arising from outer circumstances rather than welling forth from within as inner joy does. Inner joy suffices to nourish life, while external joy suffices to shorten it. Inner joy arises from nature; external joy arises from emotion. Inner joy is the stairway to sagehood; external joy is the cause of downfall. In inner joy, stillness and delight unite—though delighted, the heart remains ever quiescent. In external joy, movement and delight unite; when sights, sounds, flavors, and fragrances appear before one, there has never been a case where the heart does not stir and the spirit race. Thus it depletes and exhausts the spirit, shortening the lifespan.\n\nMoreover, external joy is the joy of following the current, while inner joy is the joy of reversing the current. Inner joy responds with quiescence; external joy responds with emotion. The heavier the emotion, the deeper the downfall—hence those on the Dao keep their distance and guard against it. Master Sanfeng said: “One should seek inner joy, not outer joy.” Confucius’s “joy lies within” refers to inner joy. If one merely attends to externals, one seeks joy only to generate affliction instead. How profound these words are!\n\n**163. Worldly Dharma and Daoist Dharma**\nWorldly dharma and Daoist dharma, when viewed through the lens of perfect interpenetration, are not two. When viewed through the lens of sequential unfolding, their tendencies differ. To say they are not two means that for those who see the truth, one rectification makes all things true. Whether coughing or waving one’s arms, nothing is not the Dao’s intent; whether carrying water or moving firewood, all becomes wondrous function. Thus the ancient sage said: “Non-doing yet nothing left undone.” To depart from all forms is to be one with all dharmas—this is the wondrous function of non-abiding for those who see the truth, something vulgar learning cannot endure.\n\nNext, when viewed through sequential unfolding, their differences are as follows: worldly dharma values firmness, Daoist dharma values softness; worldly dharma values solidity, Daoist dharma values emptiness; worldly dharma values knowledge, Daoist dharma values not-knowing and not-recognizing; worldly dharma values sharp clarity, Daoist dharma values muddled simplicity; worldly dharma values scheming, Daoist dharma values stilling the mind’s machinations; worldly dharma clings to forms at every step, while cultivating the Dao departs from forms at every step; worldly dharma values recollection, cultivating the Dao values forgetting; worldly dharma esteems movement, cultivating the Dao esteems non-movement; worldly dharma takes the self as master, cultivating the Dao takes the self as guest; worldly dharma follows the current, cultivating the Dao reverses it; in worldly dharma, heart and realm stand opposed, while in Daoist dharma, heart and realm are one; worldly dharma establishes subject and object, Daoist dharma empties subject and object; worldly dharma operates through the human heart, Daoist dharma operates through the celestial heart; worldly dharma responds with emotion, Daoist dharma responds with quiescence; worldly dharma is defiled, Daoist dharma is pure; worldly dharma is a dharma of arising and ceasing, Daoist dharma belongs to the dharma of ceasing and arising; worldly dharma is bounded, Daoist dharma transcends bounds; worldly dharma has leakage, Daoist dharma has no leakage; worldly dharma is conditioned arising, Daoist dharma is nature-arising; in worldly dharma, roots and dusts intertwine, while in Daoist dharma, roots and dusts are utterly free; worldly dharma is impermanent, Daoist dharma is truly constant; worldly dharma chases after shadows while deluded about the head, Daoist dharma observes shadows while abiding at the head; worldly dharma belongs to the non-duality of duality, Daoist dharma belongs to the non-duality of absolute non-duality; worldly dharma strengthens habitual tendencies, Daoist dharma purifies habitual tendencies; worldly dharma multiplies afflictions, Daoist dharma empties afflictions; worldly dharma leads to downfall, Daoist dharma leads to transcendence. These are all their points of difference.\n\nThus the *Cantong Qi* states: “Reversal is the function of the Dao.” The ancient sage said: “Alone I am dull,” “Alone I am dim,” “I seem to be lost,” “Alone I drift, as though without sign,” “Alone I am stubborn and coarse, differing from others in valuing the nourishment of the Mother”—are these not proofs of reversing the current?\n\n**164. Spiritual Transformation and Material Transformation**\nEast Asian culture emphasizes virtue and morality, cultivating the spirit...\n\nWestern European culture emphasizes utility and profit, cultivating materiality. This metaphysical spiritual transformation through virtue and this physical material transformation through utility—these are the points of divergence between Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nSince antiquity, the sages of our Hua land have guided the world and instructed the people, establishing their teachings with clarity of purpose, none but taking the cultivation of body and mind as their foundation. Thus, Yao and Shun transmitted the teaching: *\"Refining essence to enter the numinous is for practical application. Utilizing things to secure the body is for exalting virtue. Exhausting the numinous and knowing transformation—this is the flourishing of virtue.\"* It is also said: *\"The sage employs the numinous Dao to establish teaching, and all under heaven submits.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* states: *\"Thus, when the sage has no choice but to govern the world, nothing compares to non-action. Through non-action, the natural conditions of life and destiny are secured. Therefore, if the noble person can refrain from loosening the five viscera, refrain from overtaxing their hearing and sight, dwell in stillness yet manifest like a dragon, remain profound and silent yet resound like thunder, move spiritually and heaven follows—then, at ease in non-action, the myriad things are steamed and piled up. What leisure do I have to govern the world!\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The person of royal virtue moves plainly yet disdains entanglement in affairs, standing firm in the root and origin, knowing communion with the numinous. Thus their virtue is vast, and when their heart issues forth, it is met by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, and life does not become luminous without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue? Vast and boundless, suddenly emerging, vigorously moving, with the myriad things following—this is the person of royal virtue. Gazing into the obscure, listening to the soundless, within the obscure they alone perceive the dawn; within the soundless, they alone hear harmony. Thus, profound beyond profundity, they can embody things; numinous beyond the numinous, they can attain essence. Therefore, in their interaction with the myriad things, they meet all demands with utmost emptiness, galloping in time to bind their abode.\"*\n\nFrom this, we know that the ancient sages’ teachings all valued inner cultivation, returning to simplicity and restoring purity, penetrating the root and illuminating nature, attaining the harmony of the center—neither resisting nor anticipating. Only then can the spiritual function be boundless, responding to opportunities without obstruction, engaging with things without being ensnared by them. This is the esteem of spiritual transformation.\n\nMaterial culture, by contrast, must seek after things, preparing objects to nourish form, indulging in extravagance and gratifying desires. The spiritual source daily dries up, and one grows ever more distant from the Dao. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Chasing the myriad things without return, exhausting echoes for sound, form racing with shadow.\"*\n\nIf spiritual transformation through inner cultivation is pursued, then one finds sufficiency within oneself. The heart and breath are harmoniously balanced, form is preserved and the Dao is complete, containing light and inwardly illuminating, penetrating the three origins of virtue. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Above, they wander with the Creator; below, they befriend those beyond life and death, without beginning or end.\"* Gains and losses support one another—truly, this cannot be measured by conventional standards.\n\n*Zhuangzi* also states: *\"Those who cultivate the inner act without seeking fame; those who cultivate the outer aspire to expenditure. Acting without seeking fame, only the commonplace has luster; aspiring to expenditure—this is the merchant. Thus, the distinction between the merchant and the Daoist is the difference between Western material culture and East Asian spiritual culture.\"*\n\nMaterial transformation takes form-dharmas as its focus, using form-dharmas to nourish form and mind, satisfying the demands of the environment. Western civilization often boasts of this, unaware that as the environment constantly changes, needs become endless. Human desires grow daily, the original nature darkens, the six thieves attack in concert, and the source of life dries up. Thus, the more material civilization advances, the shorter human lifespans become; the more intense competition grows, the more bitter life becomes.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"To nourish form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are cases where things are abundant but form is not nourished. Life necessarily does not depart from form, yet there are cases where form does not depart but life perishes. Life’s coming cannot be refused, its going cannot be halted. Alas! The world believes that nourishing form suffices to preserve life, yet if nourishing form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what is the world worth?\"*\n\nWang Dashen states: *\"All sentient beings rely entirely on form and mind for sustenance. The five aggregates are at peace, the six senses enjoy their use, the six dusts serve as attendants—self-satisfied, they pass their days in pleasure, unaware that their original, luminous nature is trapped within form and mind. The five aggregates bury it, the six senses entangle it, the six dusts seal it off, so that this luminous nature is defiled for a thousand lives, wandering for ten thousand kalpas, without the slightest chance of liberation.\"*\n\nLiu Chenggan writes: *\"By today, with foreign lands interconnected, people are increasingly astonished by material inventions, mistaking them for principle—as if heaven created humanity, endowing them with a hundred bones and four limbs, solely to enjoy this world’s material things. Exhausting their thoughts and talents, they sink into greed, anger, delusion, and arrogance, striving to fulfill their desires. If this continues, will they not be reduced to beasts—or worse, devour one another? Morals grow filthy, human nature treacherous—what could be more terrifying, more lamentable!\"*\n\nI say: The greatest harm of material transformation lies in following the self and chasing things. Once one chases things, conflict and struggle inevitably arise. Today’s new weapons, used to bombard cities and harm living beings—are these not gifts of material transformation?\n\nThe greatest benefit of spiritual transformation lies in preserving the Great Harmony, maintaining serenity of body and mind, being without contention in the world, without competition among people. Like Emperor Yao’s tranquility, King Wen’s harmony, Confucius’s ease, Zhuang Zhou’s stillness—thus one may roam freely in the sea of nature, dissolving self and other in the Great Unity.\n\n**165. Steam Baths and True Qi Baths**\n\nIn recent times, Westerners have pursued hygiene with great precision. Beyond cold-water bathing, they have devised what they call \"steam baths,\" using pipes to channel water vapor and wash the entire body. When the limbs and bones undergo such a steam infusion, it can harmonize the blood and bring comfort to the whole body.\n\nYet this is but acquired *qi*, capable only of external fumigation, not internal permeation—it can cleanse the body but not the mind. It does not compare to the Daoist teachings of *mao-you* purification, which entirely relies on the primordial *True Yi’s* *qi* to scour both inner and outer, saturating the *ying* and *wei*, replenishing *qi* and blood, and strengthening both body and mind.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* depicts the *True Qi* bath in most wondrous terms:\n\n> *\"Cultivate it without cease,\n> And the *qi* moves like clouds and rain.\n> Drizzling like spring’s gentle soak,\n> Flowing like ice’s slow release.\n> From head it streams to feet,\n> Then ascends once more in full.\n> It courses through the boundless void,\n> Pervading all within the frame.\n> Reversion marks the Dao’s proof,\n> Weakness holds virtue’s key.\n> It weeds out old impurities,\n> Refining even the minute.\n> The turbid finds the path to clarity,\n> Prolonged dimness yields to light.\"*\n\nMaster Zhongli Quan said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation knows no cold or heat—this is the loftiest Daoist sage.\"*\n\nMaster Cui Xu said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation knows no cold or heat, pure Yang flows without birth or death.\"*\n\nMaster Lü (Dongbin) said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation strengthens the limbs.\"*\n\nCao Wenyi said: *\"It melts the meridians, transforming sinew and bone.\"*\n\nMaster Ge (Hong) said: *\"Jade nectar irrigates, the Grotto Chamber streams with tassels, the celestial mechanism is revealed—no myriad sounds can compare.\"*\n\nZhuo Hu said: *\"It arises like oil, ascends like mist, steams like billows, congeals like haze. The skin knits inch by inch, white *qi* pierces the sky.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said: *\"Harmonious *qi* fills and suffuses the whole body, coursing up and down, harmonizing the hundred vessels. It flows through the four limbs, pervades the frame, filling the heart with spring’s warmth—its state like mild intoxication.\"*\n\nZhang Ziyang said: *\"At first, it is like the moon filling a thousand mountains; then, like the moon cradled in ten thousand waters. The pores feel as if freshly bathed, the bones and meridians as if deeply asleep. The spirit is like lovers’ joyous union, the soul and body like mother and child’s tender clinging. A single intent of harmonious *qi*—the skin becomes refreshingly permeable.\"*\n\nZhang Sanfeng said: *\"Wait for that single point to return and submit, and the body transforms into the four seasons’ spring. A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance, each rain’s passing brings renewal. All day, it lingers like a drunkard’s haze, serene in guarding the Grotto’s spring. When all yin essence is stripped away, it becomes a lump of pure Yang gold.\"*\n\nThese are the inner visions of the Daoist *True Qi* bath, the wondrous path of cleansing body and mind. How could mere scientists ever speak of such things?\n\n---\n\n**166. Longevity and Non-Birth (Part I)**\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Buddhism proclaims non-birth, Daoism proclaims longevity. Are non-birth and longevity opposed in their aims?\"*\n\nI answer: *\"Non-birth\" employs apophatic discourse, while \"longevity\" employs cataphatic discourse—the difference lies in negating delusion versus manifesting virtue. The sages’ methods for liberating the world fall into two gates: breaking and embracing.*\n\n*\"Non-birth\" emphasizes the breaking gate, while \"longevity\" emphasizes the embracing gate. Master Mazu first established \"mind is Buddha,\" then later swept away traces to say \"neither mind nor Buddha\"—this is a shift from the embracing gate to the breaking gate.*\n\n*Non-nature and non-birth* are Buddhism’s breaking gate, yet it does not ignore the embracing gate. The *Lotus Sutra’s* \"Lifespan\" chapter states: *\"Thus have I attained Buddhahood for an immeasurable, boundless asamkhya of kalpas, my lifespan eternal, ever-abiding, never perishing.\"* Its verse says: *\"My wisdom-power is thus, my radiance illumines the boundless. My lifespan spans countless kalpas, gained through long-cultivated karma.\"*\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra’s* \"Longevity\" chapter recounts Kāśyapa Bodhisattva asking in verse:\n\n> *\"How does one attain long life,\n> A vajra body unbreakable?\n> By what cause and condition\n> Does one gain great firmness?\n> Among all dharmas,\n> All arise from blissful nature.\n> I pray, Great Sage,\n> Explain this to me in detail.\"*\n\nObserve: Kāśyapa is a Chan patriarch, yet he addresses the Buddha as \"Great Sage\" and earnestly inquires about the method of longevity—how could there not be profound meaning in this?\n\nThe Tathāgata then expounded the Dharma gate of birth, death, and long life. Kāśyapa further asked: *\"If bodhisattvas cultivate equanimity toward all beings, should they not attain long life, know past lives, abide in the world without change? Yet now, World-Honored One, by what cause and condition is your lifespan so short, like that of ordinary humans? Does the Tathāgata not hold enmity toward beings? What past evil karma did you commit, how many beings did you harm, to receive this short lifespan of less than a hundred years?\"*\n\nThe Buddha told Kāśyapa: *\"Good son, why do you speak such coarse words before the Tathāgata? The Tathāgata’s long life is supreme among all lifespans, the foremost. The eternal Dharma he attains is the highest among all eternal things.\"*\n\nKāśyapa Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha: *\"World-Honored One, how can you say the Tathāgata has attained immeasurable life?\"*\n\nThe Buddha told Kāśyapa: *\"Good son, just as the eight great rivers—first the Gaṅgā, second the Yamunā, third the Sarasvatī, fourth the Airavata, fifth the Mahā, sixth the Sindhu, seventh the Vakṣu, eighth the Sītā—along with all smaller rivers, all flow into the great ocean...\"*\n\nKāśyapa, just as all the lifespans of humans, gods, earth, and empty space—along with the great rivers—all flow into the ocean of the Tathāgata’s lifespan, so too does the Tathāgata’s lifespan become immeasurable.\n\nFurthermore, Kāśyapa, it is like Lake Anavatapta and the four great rivers. The Tathāgata is likewise the source of all life.\n\nKāśyapa, just as among all eternal things, empty space is foremost, so too is the Tathāgata foremost among all eternal things.\n\nKāśyapa, just as among all medicines, ghee is supreme, so too is the Tathāgata’s lifespan foremost among all beings.”\n\nKāśyapa Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha: “World-Honored One, if the Tathāgata’s lifespan is thus, should he not abide for an eon, or pass away after an eon, constantly revealing the wondrous Dharma like a ceaseless downpour?”\n\n“Kāśyapa, you should not conceive of the Tathāgata’s realm in terms of arising and ceasing. Kāśyapa, if there are bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, or even non-Buddhist *ṛddhi*-attaining immortals who gain mastery—whether abiding for an eon or passing after an eon, walking through empty space, sitting and lying at ease, emitting fire from their left side and water from their right, their bodies wreathed in smoke and flame like a blazing pyre—if they wish to extend their lifespan, they can do so at will, freely determining its length. Even such *ṛddhi*-attaining beings possess such wondrous powers. How much more so the Tathāgata, who has attained mastery over all dharmas, and could not fail to abide for half an eon, a full eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, or countless eons? For this reason, you should know that the Tathāgata is the eternal Dharma, the unchanging Dharma. This body of the Tathāgata is a transformed body, not born of sustenance. To liberate beings, he manifests like a poison tree, and thus relinquishes his body to enter *nirvāṇa*.”\n\nHere, the Tathāgata demonstrates that the Buddha’s lifespan is immeasurable, and though his manifested body enters *nirvāṇa*, it is not true extinction, for his Dharma-body and reward-body abide eternally. The manifested body is like the moon reflected in water—sometimes appearing, sometimes not—while the true moon in the sky remains constant and unceasing. The Tathāgata’s Dharma-body and reward-body are likewise eternal and imperishable.\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, in the “Four Marks” chapter, states: “It is like a potter who, having made a vessel, then breaks it. Liberation is not like this. True liberation is true birth without extinction. Therefore, liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is likewise—neither born nor extinguished, neither aging nor dying, neither broken nor destroyed, not a conditioned dharma. For this reason, he is called the Tathāgata. Entering great *nirvāṇa*, he is neither aging nor dying—what meaning could this have? Aging is called transmutation: white hair and wrinkled face. Dying is the breaking of the body and the end of life. Such things do not exist in liberation. Because they are absent, it is called liberation. The Tathāgata has no white hair or wrinkled face, no conditioned dharmas—thus, the Tathāgata is without aging. Without aging, there is no death. Furthermore, liberation is called freedom from illness. What is illness? The four hundred and four diseases, and other external harms that assail the body. Where these are absent, it is called liberation. Freedom from illness is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is without illness, and thus his Dharma-body is also without illness. Such freedom from illness is the Tathāgata. Death is called the breaking of the body and the end of life. Where death is absent, it is *amṛta*. This *amṛta* is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata possesses such merits. How then could one say the Tathāgata is impermanent? To say he is impermanent is without basis. How could this vajra-body be impermanent? Therefore, the Tathāgata is not called one who meets his end.”\n\nHere, the Tathāgata demonstrates that he is neither born nor extinguished, neither aging nor dying, neither broken nor destroyed, without white hair, wrinkled face, or other blemishes, and without illness—this is called true liberation. It is no different from the immortality of the immortals. One might say that immortals and Buddhas share the same essence, like water and milk perfectly blended.\n\nFurthermore, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, in the “Departure from the Worldly” chapter, speaks of ten kinds of mastery. The first is mastery over lifespan, for he abides for incalculable eons. The Buddha, in the *Sūtra of Immeasurable Life*, extensively reveals the long and distant lifespan of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life, saying: “The lifespan of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life is so long and vast that it cannot be reckoned or measured. Can you comprehend it? Suppose all the beings in the ten directions, having attained human form, were to become *śrāvakas* and *pratyekabuddhas* and gather together. With single-minded meditation and the full extent of their wisdom, they were to calculate and estimate his lifespan over hundreds of thousands of myriads of eons—still, they could not exhaust it or know its limit. The lifespans of *śrāvakas*, bodhisattvas, gods, and humans are likewise beyond the reach of calculation or analogy.” Taking “Immeasurable Life” as the Buddha’s name reveals the ultimate fruit of immortality. Thus, the Buddhist teachings do not fail to proclaim longevity.\n\nMoreover, *Liezi* says: “The doubt of the unborn is unique.” *Zhuangzi* says: “Only after transcending past and present can one enter the state of neither death nor birth.” *Laozi* says: “Only one who does not take life as something to be prized is better than one who values life.” Li Daochun says: “In quiescent realization, there is no birth.” Thus, the Daoist tradition does not fail to proclaim the unborn. Some speak of the unborn, others of long life—both employ the two gates of severing and embracing, guiding beings according to their capacities, using expedient and ultimate teachings, alternating between affirmation and negation, all fundamentally the same principle. One should not cling to one and criticize the other, giving rise to disputes over superiority and inferiority.\n\n**167. Longevity and the Unborn (II)**\n\n*Laozi* says: “That by which Heaven and Earth endure long and last long is their not living for themselves—therefore they attain long life.” Thus, to attain longevity, one must not dwell in the appearance of life; one must relinquish the form of the long-lived, forget the body and abandon form, living yet without life—unlike the ten kinds of immortals in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, who fix their thoughts to preserve form and cling to the vital principle as ultimate. Yongjia Xuanjue, the Chan Master, says in his *Song of Realizing the Dao*: “Who is without thought? Who is without birth? Truly, in the absence of birth, nothing is not born.” This means that if one truly accords with the unborn nature, there is also no extinction. Therefore, the longevity of the Daoist school does not fall into the view of eternalism, nor does the unborn of the Buddhist school fall into the view of annihilation. Because it does not fall into eternalism, though living, it does not dwell in the appearance of life; because it does not fall into annihilation, though unborn, it naturally lacks nothing in birth. The unborn who are born are Buddhas; the living who are unborn are immortals. How can one lump them into two separate categories, rank them as superior or inferior, and reject longevity in favor of the unborn?\n\n**168. The Perfected and the True Person**\n\nWithin the *Nanhua Jing*, the virtues and attributes of the Perfected and the True Person appear repeatedly. I have gathered and compiled them here to spare the reader the trouble of searching and to glimpse the essential meaning of the ancients’ teachings.\n\nThe “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter says: “The Perfected is without self.”\nThe “Equalizing Things” chapter says: “The Perfected is spirit-like: great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be heated; the Yellow River and the Milky Way may freeze, yet they cannot be chilled; swift thunder may split mountains, yet they cannot be harmed; violent winds may shake the seas, yet they cannot be startled. Such beings ride the clouds and qi, mount the sun and moon, and wander beyond the four seas. Life and death bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of profit and harm?”\nThe “Revolutions of Heaven” chapter says: “The Perfected of old borrowed the Way of benevolence, lodged in the abode of righteousness, and roamed the wilds of freedom. They ate from fields of simplicity, stood in gardens of non-transaction. Freedom is non-action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this ‘gathering the true in wandering.’”\nThe “Attaining Life” chapter says: “Have you alone not heard of the Perfected’s self-conduct? They forget their liver and gall, abandon their ears and eyes, wander in vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam freely in the work of non-action—this is called acting without reliance, growing without control.”\nThe “Responding to Emperors and Kings” chapter says: “The mind of the Perfected is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds without storing, and thus can master things without harm.”\nThe “Mastering Life” chapter says: “Life has that from which it sprouts; death has that to which it returns. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know where they exhaust. If not this, then what is their source? To attain this is the utmost beauty and joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is called the Perfected.” It also says: “As water in a ditch flows without effort and its talent is natural, so the Perfected’s virtue: without cultivation, things cannot depart from it. Like Heaven’s natural height, Earth’s natural dignity, the sun and moon’s natural brightness—what cultivation is needed?”\nIt further says: “The Perfected: above, they peer into the azure sky; below, they plunge into the Yellow Springs. They brandish and cast off the eight directions, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged.”\nThe “Knowledge Wanders North” chapter says: “The Perfected do nothing; the great sages do not act—this is called observing Heaven and Earth.”\nThe “Gengsang Chu” chapter says: “The Perfected share food upon the earth and share joy in Heaven. They do not entangle themselves with the profit and harm of others, do not conspire in strangeness, do not scheme together, do not act in concert. They come and go with ease and openness—this is called the warp of preserving life.”\nThe “Lie Yukou” chapter says: “Those Perfected return their spirit to the beginningless and delight in the realm of nothing-whatsoever. Like water flowing without form, they issue forth into the Great Purity.”\nThe “Under Heaven” chapter says: “Not departing from the true is called the Perfected.”\nThe “Way of Heaven” chapter says: “The Perfected have a world—is this not vast? Yet it is not enough to burden them. The world may wield power, yet they do not join it; they discern the absence of falsity and do not shift with profit. They exhaust the true in things and can guard their root. Thus, they leave Heaven and Earth behind, abandon the myriad things, and their spirit is never troubled. Penetrating the Dao, uniting with virtue, they withdraw from benevolence and righteousness, make guests of ritual and music—the mind of the Perfected is settled.”\n\nSurveying the above passages, the phrase “the Perfected is without self” is most pivotal. “Without self” means transforming the seventh consciousness into the wisdom of equality. When the attachment to self is emptied, one can roam freely in the sea of non-action’s nature and attain the joy of true purity. The passage stating that “great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be heated; the Yellow River and the Milky Way may freeze, yet they cannot be chilled” describes the state after the seventh consciousness is transformed. With the discriminating attachment of emotions already gone, cold and heat cannot invade—even life and death bring no change, for the bond of shared-life mechanism has been shattered.\n\nGenerally, those who study the Dao must first empty the attachment to self, then empty the attachment to dharmas. The seventh *manas* consciousness is the root of self-attachment; this consciousness takes the seeing aspect of the eighth *ālayavijñāna* as the inner self and clings to the perceived aspect of the sixth consciousness as self-awareness. If this consciousness is transformed, the attachment to self is emptied, and attainment of the Dao is certain. Thus, the *Verses on Consciousness-Only* say: “The second transformation is the consciousness called *manas*.”\n\nWith its dependence on that transformed condition as its object, *manas* takes deliberation as its nature and characteristic. It is constantly accompanied by four afflictions: delusion of self, view of self, arrogance of self, and craving of self, along with other associated factors such as contact. It is classified as obscured and indeterminate.\n\nThe *Guhyagarbha Sūtra* states in verse:\n“*Manas* clings to the *ālayavijñāna*,\nAs a magnet draws iron.\nLike a serpent with two heads,\nEach performs its own function—\nSo too the defiled mind,\nGrasping and seizing the *ālayavijñāna*,\nEngages in the activities of self,\nAugmenting the domain of ‘mine.’\nTogether with the *manovijñāna*,\nIt acts as a cause, transforming and declining.\nWithin the body, it generates warmth and touch,\nMovement and all activities.”\n\nMoreover, the First Patriarch Bodhidharma’s *Dharma Gate of Pacifying the Mind* states:\n“Question: Why do worldly people study and inquire yet fail to attain the Dao?\nAnswer: Because they perceive a self, they do not attain the Dao.”\n\nThis “self” is the “I.” The perfected person encounters suffering without sorrow, meets joy without delight—because they do not perceive a self, they remain unaware of suffering or joy. By forgetting the self, they attain utter emptiness. If even the self is extinguished, what thing remains that is not extinguished? Thus, when the attachment to self is emptied, the Dao is surely attained. The sage is without self; the perfected person is without “I.” Therein, the marvelous emptiness of objective conditions and wisdom arises, the roots and dust are wholly transformed—this is what all profound Chan and mystery together realize, the common destination of all sages, the secret key of Dao cultivation.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Great Master” chapter says:\n“What is a true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few, did not presume upon success, did not scheme over affairs. Such were they: if they erred, they did not regret; if they succeeded, they did not take pride. Such were they: they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao like this.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry; their food was not savory, their breath was deep. The true person’s breath comes from the heels; the common person’s breath comes from the throat. Those who are subdued, their words choke as if retching. Those whose desires run deep, their heavenly mechanism is shallow.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life, did not detest death. Emerging, they did not rejoice; entering, they did not resist. Swiftly they came, swiftly they went—no more. They did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end. Receiving, they rejoiced in it; forgetting, they returned to it. This is called not using the mind to harm the Dao, not using human effort to assist heaven—this is the true person.\n\nSuch were they: their minds were at ease, their countenances serene, their foreheads broad. Cold as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flowed with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet no one knew their limit.”\n\nIt further states:\n“The true persons of old upheld righteousness yet did not boast; appeared insufficient yet did not yield. They were angular but not rigid, expansive in emptiness yet not ostentatious.”\n\nAmidst their bearing—was it joy they seemed to wear?\nLofty, as though compelled by fate?\nTheir presence advanced my countenance,\ntheir stillness stilled my virtue.\nStern, as though they mirrored the world;\ntowering, as though beyond all restraint.\nLinked, as though fond of seclusion;\nbewildered, as though forgetting their own words.\n*(Here describing the virtue and conduct of the true person.)*\n\nThey took punishment as their foundation,\nritual as their wings,\nwisdom as their timing,\nand virtue as their guide.\nTaking punishment as their foundation—they were vast in their capacity to let go;\ntaking ritual as their wings—they moved through the world thereby;\ntaking wisdom as their timing—they acted only when unavoidable;\ntaking virtue as their guide—they spoke of reaching the hills with those who had feet,\nyet others truly believed them to be diligent in conduct.\nThus, what they favored was one,\nwhat they did not favor was one.\nTheir oneness was one,\ntheir non-oneness was one.\nTheir oneness joined them to heaven’s company,\ntheir non-oneness to humanity’s.\nHeaven and humanity do not overcome one another—\nthis is called the true person.\n*(Here describing the true person’s way of benefiting things and governing, even to the point of dissolving love and hate, unifying heaven and humanity, and equalizing the myriad outcomes.)*\n\nThe *Ke Yi* chapter states:\n“The Way of purity and simplicity guards only the spirit,\nholding fast without loss, merging with the spirit as one.\nThe perfection of this oneness penetrates,\naligning with the heavenly order.\nA rustic saying goes:\n‘The multitude values profit,\nthe incorruptible value reputation,\nthe worthy esteem aspiration,\nthe sage treasures essence.’\nThus, ‘simplicity’ means nothing is mixed with it;\n‘purity’ means its spirit suffers no deficiency.\nOne who embodies simplicity and purity is called a true person.”\n\nThe *Tian Zi Fang* chapter states:\n“The true persons of old—\nknaves could not sway them with flattery,\nbeauties could not seduce them,\nthieves could not plunder them,\nFuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them.\nLife and death are great indeed,\nyet nothing altered their own state—\nhow much less rank and emolument!\nSuch were they:\ntheir spirit threaded through great mountains without obstruction,\nentered deep springs without getting wet,\ndwelt in lowliness and minutiae without weariness.\nFilling heaven and earth,\nhaving given all to others,\nthey themselves possessed even more.”\n\nThe *Xu Wu Gui* chapter states:\n“Thus, they had nothing excessively dear,\nnothing excessively distant,\nembracing virtue and warming harmony\nto follow the world—\nthis is called the true person.\nToward ants, they abandoned cunning;\ntoward fish, they found the right measure;\ntoward sheep, they abandoned intent.\nWith eyes, they saw eyes;\nwith ears, they heard ears;\nwith the heart, they returned to the heart.\nSuch were they:\ntheir equilibrium was as straight as a marking-line,\ntheir transformations followed the natural course.\nThe true persons of old\nwaited upon heaven with heaven,\ndid not force humanity into heaven.\nThe true persons of old—\ngaining it, they lived;\nlosing it, they died.\nGaining it, they died;\nlosing it, they lived.”\n\nThe *Lie Yu Kou* chapter states:\n“External punishments are metal and wood;\ninternal punishments are movement and transgression.\nWhen petty men incur external punishments,\nmetal and wood interrogate them;\nwhen they incur internal punishments,\nyin and yang consume them.\nOnly the true person can escape both external and internal punishments.”\n\nThe *Tian Xia* chapter states:\n“Guan Yin and Lao Dan—\nah, the vast and true persons of old!”\n\nI observe: *Zhuangzi*’s depictions of the true person’s virtue, appearance, deeds, and efficacy may be called exhaustive. The true person is one who illuminates the essence of the one true dharma-realm and saves both self and others. The perfected person is one who inwardly realizes virtue and reaches the ultimate extreme. All alike clarify the supreme Dao, accord with true constancy, transcend beyond the ten thousand existents, roam in the realm of the Great One, and revel in the garden of quiescent extinction. That Lao Dan and Guan Yin are held as exemplars of the true person carries profound meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Virtuous Persons and Spirit Persons**\nThe *Tian Di* chapter of *Zhuangzi* states:\n“I wish to hear of the virtuous person.”\nIt was said: “The virtuous person dwells without thought,\nacts without deliberation,\nharbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness.\nWithin the four seas, sharing benefit is called joy,\nsharing provision is called peace.\nYearning, like an infant who has lost its mother;\naimless, like a traveler who has lost the way.\nWealth and resources are abundant, yet they know not whence they come;\nfood and drink suffice, yet they know not from where.\nThis is called the bearing of the virtuous person.\nI wish to hear of the spirit person.”\nIt was said: “The supreme spirit rides the light,\nvanishing with form—\nthis is called illuminating the vast.\nFulfilling destiny and exhausting passion,\nheaven and earth rejoice and the ten thousand affairs dissolve;\nthe ten thousand things return to their essence—\nthis is called merging into obscurity.”\n\nThe *Xiao Yao You* chapter states:\n“The spirit person has no merit.”\n\nThe *Tian Xia* chapter states:\n“Not departing from essence—this is called the spirit person.”\n\nI observe: *Mencius* says, “What is sagely yet unfathomable is called spirit.”\nThe *Book of Changes* says, “What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called spirit.”\nThus, the spirit person attains meaning and gives rise to form,\npossessing spiritual penetrations and freedom—\nbeyond the measure of ordinary sentiments.\nThe virtuous person embraces virtue yet has not yet entered the realm of transformation.\nLu Fanghu says: “The virtuous person is one of complete virtue.\nDwelling without thought, acting without deliberation—\nwords, movements, stillness, all are without intent.\nHarboring no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—\nthis is what is meant by ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil.’\nMoreover, they share benefit with the world as joy,\nshare provision as peace,\nentrusting their bodies to heaven without awareness of this body.\nOnly by not knowing the body do they transcend the infant who has lost its mother—\nhow much more the drifting, unaware of what they depend upon,\nwandering as though having lost the way,\nriding without knowing whither they go.\nWealth, resources, food, and drink are abundant and sufficient,\nyet they know not whence they come—\nfree from intent in seeking,\nothers do not see their lack,\nand they ever seem utterly content.\nSuch is the bearing of one of complete virtue.”\n\nThe supreme spirit ascends, and the light of sun and moon turns to shine from below. For the spirit, riding the clouds and qi, embracing sun and moon, roams in unfathomable radiance—thus it achieves this. If it were burdened by the bodily husk, how could it invert the light to gaze downward, empty and luminous, vast and boundless? Hence it is said: “With the perishing of form, this is called illuminating vastness.” The Daoist notion of passing through metal and stone without obstruction, treading sun and moon without shadow—this is the meaning.\n\nDestiny is what heaven bestows; emotion is what nature emits. When one fulfills destiny and exhausts emotion, the center is attained and harmony is also attained. Thus, above and below flow as one with heaven and earth, and the burdens of things vanish entirely. Hence it is said: “Heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve.”\n\nAs the *Zhuangzi*’s “Free and Easy Wandering” states: “On Mount Miaogu there dwells a spirit-person, whose skin is like ice and snow, whose grace is like that of a maiden. They eat no grain, but inhale the wind and drink the dew, riding clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, and roaming beyond the four seas. Their spirit congeals, causing things to be free from blight and the harvest to ripen.” Such is the virtue and appearance of the spirit-person. The virtuous person’s station is one rank below that of the spirit-person.\n\nIn the cultivation of the Mysterious Origin, after attaining the Great Return Elixir, the gate of essence is sealed, the roots of lustful mind and desire are instantly eradicated, body and mind become pure, and one embraces virtue and warms harmony, like an infant—this may be called a virtuous person. When the ten-month gestation is complete and the Dharma-body manifests, spirit transforms freely, wondrous functions arise without limit, riding wind and qi to roam beyond the six directions—this may be called a spirit-person. When one reaches the ultimate of returning to emptiness, and even emptiness crumbles to dust—this may be called a perfected person.\n\n---\n\nHong Meng Instructs on the Dao\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s “In the World of Men”:\nCloud General said, “Then what should I do?”\nHong Meng said, “Alas! How poisonous! Drift away, drift away, and return.”\nCloud General said, “I have encountered great difficulty from heaven and wish to hear a single word.”\nHong Meng said, “Alas! Nurture the heart. Simply abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your bodily form, expel your brilliance, forget human relations and things. Merge into the great primordial, release the heart and liberate the spirit, silent and without soul. The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root, each returning to its root without knowing it—confused and chaotic, never departing for a lifetime. If one knows it, this is to depart from it. Do not ask its name, do not peer into its nature—things arise of themselves.”\nCloud General said, “Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. I sought it with my own body, and now I have attained it.” He bowed twice, touched his head to the ground, rose, and departed.\n\nThis passage reveals the principle and essential technique of returning to truth. Hong Meng, or Chaos, refers to the state where thoughts and stillness are both extinguished, illumination and quiescence both forgotten, neither knowing nor recognizing, neither self nor other—what the ancient sage called “returning to the limitless.” “Expel your bodily form” means to forget the body. “Diminish your brilliance” means to forget the heart. When body and heart are both forgotten, human relations and the myriad things all vanish without trace. Thus one returns to the Great Beginning, merging with the primordial, dissolving attachments and bonds, silent and without soul. “Each returning to its root” means reverting to simplicity and returning to purity, recovering one’s original true nature. The teaching is to forget both self and others, return to chaos, leave behind the mind’s intentions, emotions, and views, abandon grasping and rejecting, transform through non-action, and restore primordial purity—only then can one drift away and return.\n\n---\n\nNie Que Asks About the Dao\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s “Knowledge Wanders North”:\nNie Que asked about the Dao from Clothed-in-Rags. Clothed-in-Rags said, “Straighten your body, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Collect your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, and the Dao will reside within you. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the past!”\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Clothed-in-Rags was greatly pleased, sang as he walked away, and said:\n“Form like a withered corpse,\nheart like dead ashes,\ntruly knowing the real,\nnot clinging to the past.\nVague and obscure,\nwithout mind, one cannot scheme with them.\nWhat sort of person is this!”\n\nThis passage of question and answer also illustrates the foundational work of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath. Here, its meaning is further expounded:\n\n\"Straighten your body\" means the body remains unmoving so the spirit naturally settles. \"Unify your gaze\" means containing the light within and inwardly illuminating, silently lowering the inner screen to observe carefully. When this is so, \"the harmony of heaven will arrive\"—this refers to the coming of primordial true yang, when the whole body becomes warm and harmonious as if intoxicated.\n\n\"Collect your knowledge\" means the spirit relies on the breath, knowing only the breath’s ingress and egress without generating other thoughts. \"Unify your measures\" means the breath’s ingress and egress harmonize with the spirit, empty and natural, as if aligned with a marking line. For before the breath is regulated, its coming and going lack measure; but when heart and breath depend on each other and regulation becomes thoroughly familiar, purely natural, then the breath is continuous and subtle, the spirit does not leave the breath, the breath does not leave the spirit—they unite as one, and opening and closing proceed with measure.\n\nThe phrase \"spirit will come to dwell\" is most profound. All previous interpreters of the *Zhuangzi* have failed to connect it with the actual work of breath regulation, so their words miss the mark and lack grounding. \"Spirit will come to dwell\" means the original spirit appears while the heart’s discriminating consciousness vanishes. Nie Que, practicing the work in the moment, listened and suddenly awakened—then fell asleep. Clothed-in-Rags was greatly pleased, for he rejoiced in Nie Que’s ability to \"unite practice and understanding, regulating the breath only briefly before falling asleep.\"\n\nHe then departed singing, his song teaching others to keep body and mind unmoving, in a state of dim obscurity, merging into undifferentiated chaos to nurture one’s nature. Caoshan said: \"Those who study the Dao are like cats or white oxen—when hungry, they eat grass; when thirsty, they drink water, never worrying that the Dao will not be attained.\" This aligns perfectly with the meaning of \"eyes bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the past.\" Thus, to cultivate the Dao, one should emulate the undifferentiated state, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile—only then can one return to authenticity and recover simplicity.\n\n---\n\n172   Guan Yin Discusses the Dao (Part One)\nFrom the *Liezi*’s “The Yellow Emperor”:\nLiezi asked Guan Yin, “The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads on fire without burning, moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?”\n\nGuan Yin replied, “This is the preservation of pure qi—it does not belong to the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness.”\n\nChild! The fish speaks to you. All that possesses form, appearance, sound, or color belongs to the realm of things. How can things distance themselves from one another? What suffices to reach the primordial? It is merely form. Thus, things arise from the formless and rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how could they be led astray? They dwell in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things. They unify their nature, nurture their qi, and embrace their virtue, thereby penetrating to the source of all things. Those who do so preserve their Heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without flaw—how could external things intrude?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He rides unaware, falls unaware; neither life nor death, neither terror nor dread, enters his breast. Thus, he encounters things without fear. If one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more so one preserved by Heaven? The sage conceals himself in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\n\nThis wondrous passage, also recorded in the *Zhuangzi*, belongs to the Daoist art of preserving life. \"Preservation of pure qi\" and \"unifying one’s nature, nurturing one’s qi\" describe the practice of heart and breath interdependent, gathering the treasures of Heaven. \"Concealing oneself in traceless order\" points to the technique of transcending the body into emptiness, concentrating the spirit in the void while emptying body and mind. \"Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things\" means returning to true emptiness, merging with the primordial before form.\n\nAll \"form, appearance, sound, and color\" pertain to the postnatal bodily form. If one clings to the bodily form in seeking the Dao, how can one transcend form and reach the primordial, where Heaven does not oppose? Only by concentrating the spirit in the emptiness beyond the body and regulating the breath can one return to the primordial state and merge with the Great Unity.\n\nBelow, the text further expounds the essence of preserving the spirit: when the spirit is whole, the body is whole; cold and heat cannot invade, nor can life and death, sorrow and peril, enter. This is why nurturing the spirit is the key to nurturing life. \"The sage conceals himself in Heaven\" means that one’s small Heaven-and-Earth (heart and breath) hibernates within the great Heaven-and-Earth (the emptiness beyond the body). In such a state, one merges with Heaven-and-Earth as one, blending into the formless. Thus, one shares the same body with emptiness and the same function with Heaven-and-Earth; bodily form and Dharma-body are nondual, movement and stillness, opening and closing, all proceeding with the great transformation. As the *Zhuangzi* says, \"The Dao flows through as one.\" Hence it is said: \"Only the enlightened know that all is one.\" To be \"through\" is to attain; to attain is to approach the subtle.\n\nShi Jianwu said: \"Heaven and man share the same qi; they respond and commune. Yang comes from emptiness, embracing me, the master.\" Zhang Ziqiong said: \"Heaven and man share the same qi from the beginning; only the bodily form obstructs their communion. When refinement reaches the point where form and spirit merge, one knows that form is none other than true emptiness.\" Man conceals himself in Heaven, and so Heaven and man act in unison, establishing the foundation of the myriad transformations—this is called \"Heavenly roaming.\"\n\nAs for the practice, it is simply concentrating the spirit in emptiness, interweaving heart and breath, and attaining great stillness. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"The true person dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass.\" And: \"The origin is hidden in brightness; the bodily form is concealed within.\" Confucian Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* likewise states: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss; beauty lies in returning to the root.\" Both draw from this teaching, revealing the secret of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath beneath the pillar.\n\n---\n\n173   Guan Yin Discusses the Dao (Part Two)\nFrom the *Liezi*’s “Confucius”:\nGuan Yin said: “Within oneself, take no abode; let things manifest their forms. Still as a mirror, responsive as an echo—thus the Dao resembles things. Things depart from the Dao; the Dao does not depart from things. Those who are good at the Dao neither use the ears, nor the eyes, nor strength, nor the heart. To seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. It may appear before you, then suddenly behind; employed, it fills the six directions; discarded, none know its whereabouts. Neither those with intent nor those without can grasp it—far or near. Only those who silently attain it and let their nature perfect it can obtain it.\n\nTo know and forget emotion, to be capable yet not act—this is true knowledge, true ability. How can one have emotion if one emanates non-knowing? How can one act if one emanates non-ability? A clod of earth, a pile of dust—though they do nothing, they are not without principle.”\n\nThis wondrous discourse by Guan Yin perfectly embodies the Dao, circling within its center, illuminating past and future. It is the supreme teaching of the Mysterious School, the subtle Dao of the pillar’s simplicity and constancy. \"Within oneself, take no abode\" deeply accords with the *Diamond Sutra*’s \"abide nowhere while giving rise to the heart.\" \"Let things manifest their forms\" means clarity shines in every instance, revelation appears in every thing—what the Perfected Purple Yang called \"not a single thing is not my heart.\"\n\n\"Still as a mirror\" describes stillness that illuminates, ever illuminating without cease. As the *Zhuangzi* says: \"The mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds without storing, and thus masters things without harm.\" The mirror’s function is to reflect things without emotion: it responds to what comes and does not retain what goes. Thus, it illustrates the marvel of the perfected person’s mindless response to things.\n\n\"Their movement is like water\"—universally nourishing yet without intent. Though water moves, its moist nature remains unchanged, revealing the secret of the perfected person’s unchanging response to conditions.\n\nTheir response is like an echo—revealing how each knock elicits an immediate answer: a great sound yields a great response, a small sound a small response, and equal sounds equal responses. Without fail, it answers every strike, illustrating the marvel of universal response without intent.\n\n\"That their Dao is like things\" shows how it accords with each capacity, neither lacking nor exceeding—whether in principle or in practice, nothing is not perfectly fulfilled.\n\n\"Silently one attains it\" expresses the wonder of mind-to-mind transmission, as when one drinks water and knows its warmth or coolness for oneself.\n\n\"Those whose nature is perfected attain it\" means that the inherent perfection of heart-nature is realized through direct realization, not through contrivance.\n\n\"Emerging without knowledge\" aligns with the *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra*’s teaching of \"non-knowledge.\"\n\n\"Knowing yet forgetting emotion\" perfectly captures the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s sublime principle of \"knowing without seeing.\"\n\nNirvāṇa’s untainted true purity—Guan Yin must have personally realized it.\n\nViewed alongside the preceding section’s teachings on nurturing qi and concealing spirit, the heart-transmission of the Master of the Pillars and the profound mysteries of the Daoist tradition are fully revealed.\n\n---\n\n174. Kàng Cāng’s Proof of the Dao\nFrom the \"Zhongni\" chapter of the *Liezi*:\n\nA minister from Chen paid a state visit to Lu and privately met with the Shusun clan. Shusun said, \"There is a sage in our state.\"\n\nThe minister asked, \"Is it not Kong Qiu?\"\n\nShusun replied, \"It is. How do you know he is a sage?\"\n\nShusun said, \"I once heard Yan Hui say: ‘Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body.’\"\n\nThe minister from Chen said, \"There is also a sage in our state—have you not heard of him?\"\n\nShusun asked, \"Who is this sage?\"\n\nThe minister replied, \"Among Lao Dan’s disciples is one named Kàng Cāng, who has attained Lao Dan’s Dao. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to summon him. Kàng Cāng accepted the invitation and arrived.\n\nThe Lord of Lu, speaking humbly, inquired of him. Kàng Cāng said, \"Those who transmitted this were mistaken. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse the functions of ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu said, \"This is even more extraordinary! What is the nature of this Dao? I earnestly wish to hear it.\"\n\nKàng Cāng said, \"My body unites with the heart-mind, the heart-mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, and spirit unites with the Nothingness. When there is a presence with firm resolve or a sound with pure resonance—whether distant at the eight wilds’ edge or near within the space between brows and lashes—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this is perceived by my seven apertures and four limbs, or known by the heart, belly, and five viscera. It is simply self-knowing.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu was greatly pleased. Another day, he told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer. (The two sages both resonated in that smile—subtle! Subtle!)\n\nThis chapter penetrates above and below, concise in words yet comprehensive in meaning, leaving nothing unencompassed, and strikes the mark with divine subtlety. The Song dynasty Chan master Yongming composed the *Zongjing lu*, which also cites this passage. In his explication of \"self-knowing,\" he states that it is the wondrous accord of the One Heart, transmitted from sage to sage—only this Dao.\n\nXuánjìng remarked: The lines \"the heart-mind unites with qi\" and so forth point to the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, forgetting the form to cultivate qi, forgetting qi to cultivate spirit, and forgetting spirit to cultivate emptiness. These three barriers of practice encompass all without omission. Truly, this is the height of simplicity and subtlety. As for \"seeing and hearing without using ears and eyes,\" it is evidence of the six senses returning to stillness and the merging of disparate natures into unity. The ancients said, \"Seeing without eyes, hearing without ears\"—this is the true realm of the Daoist adept. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"If you refrain from following the twelve conditioned states—movement and stillness, union and separation, tranquility and change, obstruction and passage, arising and ceasing, brightness and darkness—and uproot even one sense faculty, freeing it from entanglement and turning it inward to return to the original true, the radiance of its nature will shine forth. Once this luminosity is revealed, the remaining five senses will likewise be uprooted and fully liberated. Do you not know that in this assembly, Aniruddha sees without eyes; the dragon Bhadanta hears without ears; the goddess Gaṅgā perceives fragrance without a nose; the brahmin Gavāṃpati knows taste with a different tongue; the spirit Śunyatā senses touch without a body; and the śrāvaka attains quiescence. Here too, Mahākāśyapa, having long extinguished the root of thought, abides in perfect clarity, knowing without reliance on mental activity.\"\n\nThis confirms that in the cultivation of immortals and buddhas, the six senses are liberated, the dust of defilements dissolves, and awakening is perfected—there is no second Dao.\n\nAlas! Had Laozi not taken the *Yi*’s imagery as his foundation but instead followed Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Lao Dan, Guan Yin, Kàng Cāng, Zhuangzi, and Liezi to compose the *Cantong qi*, it would surely have been even more remarkable.\n\n---\n\n175. The Old Fisherman’s Angling\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"Tian Zifang\" chapter:\n\nKing Wen observed at Zāng and saw an old man angling. Yet his angling was no angling—though he held a fishing rod, he did not angle as others do, for his was the angling of constancy. King Wen wished to raise him to office and entrust him with governance, but feared his great ministers and elders would not accept it. He wished to leave the matter and let it go, yet could not bear the thought of the people being without a ruler.\n\nAt dawn, King Wen summoned his ministers and said: “Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark-complexioned and bearded. He rode a dappled horse with one red hoof and declared: ‘Entrust your governance to the Old Fisherman of Zāng; perhaps then the people may find relief.’” The ministers, startled, exclaimed: “This was our late lord, the former king!” King Wen said: “Then let us divine his will.” The ministers replied: “The command of the former king admits no alternative—what need is there for divination?” Thereupon they welcomed the Old Fisherman of Zāng and entrusted him with governance. No statutes were altered, no decrees were issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found: the ranks of scholars had disbanded, their factions dissolved; officials no longer cultivated virtue; measuring vessels dared not cross the four borders; and the feudal lords harbored no disloyalty. Thereupon King Wen appointed him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and inquired: “Can such governance extend to all under Heaven?” The Old Fisherman, silent and unmoved, declined with vague words. By nightfall, he had fled, vanishing without trace.\n\nXuanjing observes: The Old Fisherman of Zāng was none other than Grand Duke Wang, a man of the Dao. He feigned angling as a guise: one hand held the rod, the other watched the floating bob, his spirit gathered in emptiness, heart and breath interdependent. In a trance of indistinct reverie, he angled for something beyond the hook. Thus, though his hand grasped the rod, the rod never stirred. Angling yet not angling, not angling yet angling—how sublime! The ancients cultivated their work in every moment and place. As the Boat Monk said: *“A thousand feet of line cast deep—intent lies in the abyss. But tell me, what was the outcome?”* I cite the Boat Monk’s verse in witness:\n\n*A thousand feet of silk line hangs straight down,\nA single ripple stirs ten thousand more.\nIn still night’s chill, the fish do not bite—\nThe moonlit boat returns empty.*\n\nWhen King Wen raised the Old Fisherman to governance, the man embodied the inner sageliness and outer kingliness of the Dao. Without action, the people transformed themselves; without rewards, they strove; without words, they trusted. His governance was resplendent, surpassing even King Wen’s reach. For he moved hearts purely through the Dao, without recourse to laws or decrees. Thus, when King Wen sought to appoint him Grand Preceptor, the old man drifted away like a wild goose into the boundless sky—what archer could aspire to such heights? Truly, he came and went without trace, a divine dragon whose head appears but tail remains unseen.\n\n---\n\n176. The Casting of Bells in the Northern Palace\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"Mountains and Rivers\" chapter:\n\nFor Duke Ling of Wei, Beigong She levied funds to cast bells. He erected an altar beyond the outer gate, and within three months, the upper and lower chimes were completed (all eight instruments assembled in suspension—so swift was their completion). Prince Qingji saw this and asked: “What method did you employ?” She replied: “In the space between (embracing unity alone), I dared not impose any method. I have heard: ‘Once carved and polished, return to simplicity.’ Unknowing and unassuming, drifting in doubt, I gathered in boundless vagueness. I sent off the departing and welcomed the arriving—arrivals were not barred, departures were not hindered.”\n\nFrom their strength and vigor, following their curves and contours, yielding to their natural exhaustion—these three phrases describe the marvel of spontaneity. Thus, though levies were gathered morning and evening, not a hair was harmed; how much more so for those who tread the great thoroughfare!\n\nThe *Secret Explication* states: The *Zhuangzi* is nine-tenths parable, and this too is a parable. \"Casting bells\" is a metaphor for forming the embryo. \"Levying funds\" refers to gathering the primordial qi. \"Completed in three months\" signifies the hundred-day foundation of base-building. \"Erecting an altar beyond the outer gate\" clarifies that the empty space outside the body is the alchemical altar, the crucible and vessel positioned therein. From \"in the space between\" onward, it purely demonstrates the work. What is meant by \"in the space between\"? It is the principle of guarding the center and embracing unity, the practice of concentrating spirit and regulating breath. When heart and breath harmonize, the two realms converge, merging into one—this alone is the task. \"Return to simplicity\" means that, through prolonged stabilization of spirit and qi, thoughts and breath are both forgotten, returning to chaos. \"Unknowing and unassuming, drifting in doubt, gathering in boundless vagueness\" describes a state of utter oblivion, profound stillness. \"Sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving\" means the heart follows the breath: one breath departs, one breath arrives, heart and breath cling to each other. \"Following, yielding, relying\"—these three words exhaust the subtleties of breath regulation. Since ancient times, no one discussing breath regulation has surpassed this three-word secret. In a single phrase: simply follow nature. Gathering in the morning and levying in the evening, primordial yang accumulates daily, yet my body and heart remain unmoved, profoundly settled. Through stillness, one responds without sensing toil, so not a hair is harmed. The concluding lines are even more marvelous: \"the great thoroughfare\" refers to the divine continent of the Red Region, the empty space outside the body. Dwelling in the world’s great thoroughfare, treading the Dao with ease—what affair could remain unresolved? Mencius said: \"Dwell in the world’s broadest abode, stand in the world’s correct position, walk the world’s great Way.\" This truly aligns with the marvelous principle of the great thoroughfare. Sima Ziwei said: \"The empty void, a single aperture called the Mysterious Pass, lies between heaven and earth in the human body. Vastly encompassing the Dharma Realm without trace, subtly entering dust motes unseen.\" Luo Gongyuan said: \"A single aperture of emptiness amid heaven and earth, entwined and secret, impervious to wind.\" All reveal the secret of \"the great thoroughfare.\"\n\n---\n\n177. Confucius’ Admirable Retreat\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"Mountain Trees\" chapter:\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren came to offer condolences, saying: \"Were you nearly dead?\" Confucius replied: \"Yes.\" \"Do you detest death?\" \"Yes.\" Ren said: \"Let me speak of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called the *yidai*. As a bird, it is leisurely and unhurried, appearing incapable. It flies only when aided and roosts only when pressed. Advancing, it dares not take the lead; retreating, it dares not lag behind. In eating, it dares not taste first but must take the remnants. Thus, it is never expelled from the flock, and outsiders never harm it, so it avoids disaster. The straightest trees are felled first; the sweetest wells are drained first. You, in your intent, adorn knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose impurity, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride—how could you escape harm? Long ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast achieve no merit; those who complete merit fall; those who achieve fame suffer loss.' Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the multitude? The Dao flows but does not dwell in brightness; virtue acts but does not reside in renown. Pure and constant, one resembles the mad. Erasing traces, relinquishing power, one does not pursue merit or fame. Thus, one bears no blame from others, and others bear none from them. The perfected person remains unknown—why do you delight in this?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent!\" He parted from his associates, left his disciples, and fled to the great marshes. Clad in furs and coarse cloth, eating acorns and chestnuts, he entered the beasts’ midst without disrupting their herds, entered the birds’ midst without disturbing their flocks. Birds and beasts did not detest him—how much less would humans!\n\nThe *Explication* states: This passage uses Confucius to expound a lesson, urging those who cultivate the Dao to relinquish thoughts of merit and profit, blend with the world, avoid standing out to alarm others, and refrain from seeking fame to exalt themselves. Serene and detached, indifferent and remote—only thus can one preserve the body and avoid harm. Yang Yinxiou said: \"Zhuangzi’s 'pure and constant' is Laozi’s 'simple and dull'—Zhuangzi inherited Laozi’s teachings, forming a distinct school.\" Gui Zhenchuan said: \"Riding the Dao to wander through the world, appearing wise or foolish, one must shed burdens and empty oneself, embrace simplicity and adaptability, relinquish merit and fame, abandon social circles, accept poverty and follow one’s lot, neither chasing things nor priding oneself—this is the way to preserve the body and avoid harm.\" Lu Fanghu said: \"The Dao flows without dwelling in brightness—from ancient times to the present, day and night pass like this, silently operating without ever declaring itself as Dao. This is the Dao’s marvel. Those who embody the Dao, dwelling in attainment without attachment, approach it. 'Attainment' means achieving one’s will. 'Residing in renown' refers to self-display and self-boasting. 'Pure' means singular; 'constant' means ordinary. To unify the heart and make conduct ordinary is to resemble the recklessly mad. Thus, it is said: 'one resembles the mad.' Erasing traces means shutting the door and sweeping away tracks, leaving no wheel ruts behind.\"\n\nTo relinquish power means neither serving kings and lords nor engaging in persuasive speech. Thus, one does not establish merit for the world or fame for all ages, nor does one seek perfection from others—therefore, others cannot demand perfection in virtue from them. Such conduct, seeking neither recognition nor prominence, belongs to those who leave no trace. I observe that practitioners of the Dao are often slandered by the vulgar, half of which stems from self-display. Scholars must therefore discard ornamentation and embrace plainness, merging indistinguishably with the great unity. They should act in hidden subtlety, leaving no trace, seeking only self-knowledge rather than worldly renown—only then can they transcend free of encumbrance. This point is of utmost importance, hence its inclusion here. If one can depart from the dust of the world, retreat into the great marshes or beneath cliffs and ravines, dwelling in thatched huts or stone chambers in tranquil seclusion, utterly cut off from the world, it would be even better.\n\n---\n\n**178. Yanzi’s Sitting-in-Forgetfulness**\nFrom *Zhuangzi·The Great Master*:\nYan Hui said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius asked, “What do you mean?”\nHe replied, “I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.”\nConfucius said, “Good, but not yet sufficient.”\nAnother day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius asked, “What do you mean?”\nHe replied, “I have forgotten ritual and music.”\nConfucius said, “Good, but not yet sufficient.”\nAnother day, they met again, and Yan Hui said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius asked, “What do you mean?”\nHe replied, “I sit in forgetfulness.”\nConfucius started in surprise and asked, “What is sitting-in-forgetfulness?”\nYan Hui said, “I discard my limbs and body, dismiss my hearing and sight, leave behind form and knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called sitting-in-forgetfulness.”\nConfucius said, “To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. You are indeed worthy! I would follow after you.”\nHere, I shall briefly elucidate its meaning.\n\nYan Hui’s sitting-in-forgetfulness is an effortless entry into samādhi. When samādhi endures, inner and outer become utterly forgotten—this is the most wondrous and profound state. \"Leaving form\" means the body is emptied; \"dismissing knowledge\" means the mind is emptied. When body and mind, inner and outer, are all empty, one’s hidden self leaves no trace, and the entire dharma-realm manifests. Thus it concludes with \"merging with the Great Thoroughfare\"—this is precisely the moment of realizing the equality of dharmatā.\n\nLu Pingquan said, “Sitting-in-forgetfulness is the Chan school’s ‘facing the wall.’” Sima Ziwei said, “Sitting-in-forgetfulness is the foundation of long life. Thus, one summons the true to refine the form, and when the form is purified, it unites with qi. One embraces the Dao to refine qi, and when qi is purified, it unites with spirit. When the body and the Dao become one, this is called attaining the Dao. The true is the dwelling place of the Dao. Therefore, one calms the spirit to align with the true.”\n\nZhuangzi said, *“When the universe is at peace and settled, it emits celestial radiance.”* The “universe” is the mind; “celestial radiance” is the illumination of wisdom. When the mind is first settled, wisdom shines forth from within, illuminating the emptiness of all phenomena. The mind then merges with stillness—this is called sitting-in-forgetfulness.\n\nI say that in the profound tradition of sitting-in-forgetfulness, the subtlety lies in the dual settling of mind and breath. From settling, one forgets; spirit and qi return to their root, and the embryo of the Dao takes form. Within this lies boundless celestial mechanism. As Cao Wenyu said, *“Merge into one and then forget the one—thus may one emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.”* If one merely practices withered Chan, it is no different from sitting while distracted—this is not sitting-in-forgetfulness.\n\n**Liezi Riding the Wind**\nIn the *Zhuangzi*’s “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter, it says, *“Liezi rode the wind and traveled, soaring lightly and gracefully. After fifteen days, he returned. Among those who attain good fortune, he was not one to strive anxiously.”* The *Liezi*’s “Yellow Emperor” chapter also states, *“Liezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Having transmitted the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned.”*\n\nXuanjing said: In my view, this is merely figurative speech.\n\nThe in-and-out breath of us humans is none other than the *wind element*; with spirit guiding qi, heart and breath interpenetrate—proceeding thus to the state of *great samādhi* is the true practice of \"riding the wind.\" Liezi further states: *\"When the heart congeals and form dissolves, bones and flesh wholly fuse. One no longer senses where the body leans or where the feet tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or husk, utterly unaware whether the wind bears me or I ride the wind!\"* This is the merging of heart and breath into oneness, where one no longer knows whether spirit depends on breath or breath on spirit. As spirit and breath fuse, they enter together into the realm of *huanghu* and *yaoming*, the state of *xiyi* and *great samādhi*—this is the esoteric purport of Zhuangzi’s *Free and Easy Wandering* and the true essence of Liezi’s \"riding the wind.\" The \"fifteen days\" symbolize the first half-month up to the full moon as the phase for *advancing the fire*, requiring the *xun* wind to stir it. After fifteen days, the yang tide naturally recedes, so one must *retreat the talisman* to correspond with it. Master Cuixu said: *\"When spirit and qi merge in darkness and qi returns, bones and flesh fuse in harmony—one knows it not.\"* Hence, \"bones and flesh wholly fuse.\"\n\nThe perfected adept, possessing the *spiritual power of swiftness*, roams the ten directions—wherever the mind wills, there they arrive. What need have they for wind? Thus, the wind Liezi rides is none other than the *breath-wind*, the essential technique of guiding qi with spirit and the profound purport of the harmonious fusion of heart and breath.\n\n**Changfang’s Earth-Shrinking**\nThe *Biographies of Divine Immortals* records that Fei Changfang possessed divine arts and could contract the earth’s veins, bringing a thousand *li* into immediate view as if before one’s eyes, then restoring them to their original expanse. This *earth-shrinking* method, if considered in light of the unobstructed spiritual powers of immortals and buddhas, allows one to compress thousands of *li* into a foot’s span or eons into a single instant—time and spatial measure may be extended or contracted at will, without hindrance. Such principles are entirely credible. As the heart is free, so too is the Dharma.\n\nDelving into its esoteric meaning, it is truly the purport of heart and breath depending on each other, spirit and breath merging in secrecy. Through this mutual dependence, the in-and-out breath shortens from long, then from long to short, until it vanishes—is this not the image of *earth-shrinking*? Some may ask: If so, then is the earth’s vein equated with the in-and-out breath? What proof is there? The answer: Heart and breath are the yin and yang of the human person, the heaven and earth of the body. In the *Book of Changes*, they are *Qian* and *Kun*; in the human, they are body and mind. The heart is spirit; the body is qi. Thus, the image of *earth-shrinking* is the image of *revolving the breath to return to the origin*, the dissolution of breath into emptiness. When the heart unites with the breath, the breath’s extension and contraction also become free, expanding and contracting in perfect measure—this is the alternating use of *civil fire* and *martial fire*.\n\nZhou Jichang’s *Daoist Songs* states: *\"Who knows the wondrous art of mending heaven? Who understands the marvel of shrinking earth?\"* Master Yuchan’s *Breath-Regulation Formula* says: *\"In regulating the breath’s fire-timing, there is the *gathering breath*. The heart must be able to empty and humble itself, then essence can enter the crucible—this is called the *earth-shrinking* method.\"* This may mutually verify the present explanation.\n\n**Nüwa Mends Heaven**\n\n*The Huainanzi* and *Records of the Grand Historian* both record that Nüwa smelted the Five-Colored Stones to mend the heavens’ breach. Nüwa was the younger sister of Fuxi and an ancient sovereign. Though the smelting of stones to mend the heavens never occurred in fact, the image remains. It embodies the alchemical secret of *drawing from Kan to fill Li*.\n\nHeaven is the body of *Qian*, the pure Yang substance. Its sudden collapse and breach symbolize the middle line of *Qian* sinking into *Kan* and transforming into *Li*. The stone is the single Yang within *Kan*. When refined and used to mend *Li*, it restores the *Qian* hexagram. Thus, when *Qian* and *Kun* invert to become *Kan* and *Li*, metal sinks and wood floats. When *Kan* and *Li* invert to become *Qian* and *Kun*, the sunken metal rises, and the floating wood descends. The reverse application of the Five Phases hinges solely on this central inversion.\n\nThe alchemical method of *drawing from Kan to fill Li* originated with Nüwa. Without doubt, Nüwa’s elixir method was taught to her by her brother Fuxi. In activity, it is Fuxi; in stillness, it is Nüwa—are they not the primal ancestors of the Mysterious Tradition? The origins of Daoist learning are profoundly ancient, as this may attest.\n\nNüwa’s smelting of stones to mend the heavens and Zhuangzi’s *roc bird soaring southward* both embody the image of *drawing from Kan to fill Li* to restore the *Qian* body. In terms of practice, it does not extend beyond the mutual dependence of heart and breath.\n\n---\n\n**Shu Ao Regulates the Breath**\nIn *Zhuangzi·Tian Zifang*, Jian Wu asked Sunshu Ao: “You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils breathing freely—how do you cultivate your heart-mind?”\n\nSunshu Ao replied: “How do I surpass others? I accept what comes without refusal and do not cling to what departs. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so remain free of sorrow. How do I surpass others?”\n\nSunshu Ao had mastered the gateway to regulating the breath, concentrating the spirit, and abiding in joy—attaining the samādhi of self-enjoyment. Thus, the rise and fall of office left no trace in his heart; truly, he was free and untrammeled. The phrase *xuxu* describes the breath as fine and subtle, drifting leisurely like a butterfly circling among flowers—its movement so delicate. The description is most apt. At first, Jian Wu could not fathom how Sunshu Ao remained so unmoved by wealth and honor, but upon observing the harmonious tranquility of his nasal breath, he suddenly understood. How remarkable a figure Jian Wu was as well!\n\n**Hugong Conceals His Body**\nBoth *The Biographies of Divine Transcendents* and *The Book of Later Han·Biographies of Masters of Esoteric Arts* record that Hugong sold medicines, hanging a gourd at his stall. After the sun set, he would leap into the gourd, where none could see him—save for the market inspector Fei Changfang, who witnessed this from an upper story and rejoiced. Fei then went to pay homage, personally sweeping the ground before Hugong’s seat and preparing food and offerings. Hugong accepted these without refusal.\n\nThus, over time, Changfang remained unwavering in his devotion, never daring to make any requests (beholding the sincerity of ancients in seeking a master, truly worthy of emulation). Hugong, recognizing Changfang’s steadfast faith, said to him, “Come again at dusk when no one is about.” Changfang followed his instruction and returned, whereupon they leapt together into the gourd. Once inside, he no longer perceived it as a mere gourd but beheld instead a world of immortals’ palaces—towers and layered gates, covered walkways and halls, fine wine and delicacies filling the space. They drank together, then emerged.\n\nLater, when Hugong prepared to depart, Changfang followed him into the mountains to study the Dao. This episode is most wondrous, revealing its meaning both openly and subtly. The gourd symbolizes the mysterious aperture of the *xuanguan*, the very essence of “guarding the center”—a realm of emptiness beyond the body. Leaping into it with one’s form is to concentrate the spirit in the void. Retreating and concealing oneself within the gourd, spirit and breath intermingle, gradually harmonizing, gradually settling, until the physical form dissolves, and the primordial *yuan-yang* true *qi* of pre-heaven permeates and nourishes the body, suffusing it with a soft, blissful ease, as if intoxicated by the warmth of spring—an ineffable delight. This is the profound significance of the gourd containing another heaven.\n\n*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states:\n*“The pre-heavenly qi, the post-heavenly breath—*\n*Those who attain it ever seem drunk.”*\nThis is the meaning of their shared intoxication and satiety.\n\nThus, Master Sanfeng said:\n*“Who knows the vastness of heaven and earth in stillness?*\n*I love the long days and months within the gourd.”*\nAnd again:\n*“Knowing only the realm of heaven and earth within the gourd,*\n*Who recalls the passing years of the human world?”*\nAnd:\n*“A single night of diligent refinement below—*\n*Within the gourd, a thousand years of days and months.”*\n\nLü Zu said:\n*“Wind and clouds of the grotto return to my grasp,*\n*The days and months of the gourd rest in my breast.”*\nAnd:\n*“The world’s cycles of sixty years cannot bind,*\n*Within the gourd, heaven and earth are free.”*\nAnd:\n*“Beyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are my companions;*\n*Within the gourd, sun and moon are ever fair.”*\nAnd:\n*“Qi returns, the elixir forms of itself,*\n*Within the gourd, Kan and Li unite.”*\n\nLongmei Zi said:\n*“Endless transformations of life and creation—*\n*All manifest as a grotto-heaven within the gourd.”*\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*“Within, there is a true gourd-heaven,*\n*Where wind and light are bright, the moon pure.”*\nAnd:\n*“Though the seas may turn to mulberry fields,*\n*Within my Dao, not a year has passed in the gourd.”*\n\nBai Yuchan said:\n*“The heart enters emptiness, practicing the fire times;*\n*Inner and outer scenes—heaven within the gourd.”*\nAnd:\n*“Beyond the body, seek within the body;*\n*Harmonious, vital qi—a spring within the gourd.”*\nAnd:\n*“A carefree, idle man,*\n*His hut holds a gourd of spring.”*\n\nTang Guangzhen said:\n*“When the day comes that the elixir is formed,*\n*Drunk within the gourd, no need for support.”*\n\nCangming Zi said:\n*“Within the gourd, every scene is present,*\n*Yin and yang rise and fall by their own measure.”*\n\nAll these describe the inner vision of withdrawing into the gourd, harmonizing the breath, merging spirit and *qi*, the true *qi* flowing like clouds, wearing flowers and drinking wine—carefree and at ease. The profound principle of the gourd-heaven is most wondrous. To resolve the question of human existence and transcend the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, nothing but this gourd-heaven will suffice. Qiu Zu’s Daoist name, Changchun (“Ever-Spring”), deeply grasped the secret of the gourd-heaven.\n\nMaster Gui’an of Yu’an said:\n*“Entering through the gate, one finds not the family treasure;*\n*Beyond, there is the gourd’s heaven and earth of spring.”*\nEven Chan Buddhism praises the gourd-heaven. Yet in recent times, Chan monasteries cling to withered Chan, cold ashes and dead wood, utterly devoid of vitality—clearly not the true intent of the Western Patriarch.\n\n**184. The Queen Mother Cultivates Peaches**\n*The Comprehensive Mirror of Divine Transcendents* details the grandeur of the Peach Assembly. Immortals raise their cups, reveling amidst seas and mountains—how the heart yearns for such a scene! The *pantao* peaches are cultivated by the Queen Mother of the West, ripening but once every three thousand years. Yet Dongfang Shuo is said to have stolen them. In Zhang Sanfeng’s *Lyrics of the Rootless Tree*, he writes:\n*“Entering the immortal court, bold of spirit,*\n*I stole the peaches of the Queen Mother of Yao Pond.”*\nThough couched in allegory, this holds a profound secret. The Queen Mother embodies *Kun*, the image of Laozi’s “attaining emptiness and guarding stillness.” The peach symbolizes the primordial *qi*. The ancestral *qi* of pre-heaven must rely on *Kun*-earth to take form. As *Awakening to Reality* says, “Depending on the position of *Kun*, the body is formed.” *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states:\n*“Born in Kun, planted in Qian.”*\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*“The eldest son inherits the father’s body,*\n*By the mother, the foundation is laid.”*\nThe *Book of Changes*’ *Kun* hexagram reads:\n*“In the southwest, one finds companions.”*\nAll these describe the same image.\n\nThe peach ripens once every three thousand years—three being the generative number of wood—thus the peach embodies the image of *Zhen*. The Queen Mother represents the image of *Kun*; when she plants the peach and reaps the peach, above *Kun* and below *Zhen* form the hexagram *Fu*, the image of *\"Thunder quakes beneath the earth, and the yellow sprout emerges from the soil.\"* This is also what is meant by *\"From emptiness and stillness, white snow is born; from silence, the yellow sprout arises.\"*\n\nDongfang Shuo entered the Queen Mother’s peach garden and stole the peaches, which is to say, within the moving lines of the *Fu* hexagram, he gathered the primordial ancestral *qi* and returned it to the earthen crucible. As *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"Recognizing the call, he brings it home to nourish.\"*\n\nDongfang Shuo and the Queen Mother naturally stand opposite as east and west. First, he enters from the east into the west, then returns from the west back to the east. *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The Metal Duke is originally the son of the eastern household, sent to the western neighbor to lodge and take form.\"* In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong is born in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body, travels to the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift to study the Dao, and later returns to Flower-Fruit Mountain. His battle with Erlang Shen (paired with the Maiden of Cinnabar in spiritual affinity), his capture by Lord Laozi, and his confinement in the Eight-Trigram Furnace (returned to the earthen crucible and sealed fast) all share the same meaning.\n\nOtherwise, why must the Queen Mother be the one to cultivate the peaches? Why must the act of stealing them be attributed to Dongfang Shuo and no other? When the peaches ripen, the immortals gather to raise their cups in celebration, yet those who cultivate the profound mystery, once their practice reaches fruition, find their entire body softened, the true *qi* of original yang coursing and steaming through them, circulating throughout, like clouds drifting and rain descending, all things flourishing and harmonious. At all times, they may pluck the peach of immortality and drink the wine of the immortals—why wait for the Queen Mother to spread her feast before raising a cup?\n\nMaster Lü says: *\"I drink the wine of long life in solitude—who knows my carefree joy?\"* Master Zhang Sanfeng declares: *\"When hunger comes, I drink the wine of long life, daily growing drunk as mud.\"* These words may be pondered.\n\nOne, eight, five—primal harmony in a single hue.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* states: *\"When qi harmonizes with supreme harmony, attaining the One, the Dao is wholly at peace. Harmony itself is no single harmony—its profound principle merges with the boundless.\"* The *Scripture of the Heart Seal* says: *\"Supreme harmony overflows, bones scattering like cold jade.\"*\n\nIn the cultivation and realization of the profound mystery, heart and breath merge in wondrous union, water and fire blend as one, inner and outer harmonize alike. With the harmony of the entire body, one resonates with the harmony of heaven and earth, the surging harmony pervading all, vast and inexhaustible. Thus, the *Triple Concordance Canon* declares:\n\n*\"Dripping like vernal rain,\nFlowing like melting ice,\nFrom head to foot it streams,\nThen ascends once more,\nCoursing through the infinite,\nPervading all within.\"*\n\nShi Xinglin says:\n*\"Clouds disperse, revealing the crabapple moon,\nSpring deepens with the willow’s breeze.\nWho knows this meaning?\nI lift my eyes to ask the empty sky.\"*\n\nThis is the wondrous realm of supreme harmony, where phoenix and simurgh sing in unison. Here, the embryo of the Dao may be perfected, mortal form transformed. By bathing body and mind in its purity, desire’s fire is stilled and the five spirits grow serene; by nurturing the root-source, yin qi dissolves and the hundred bones align. Gathered, the five qi ascend to the origin; dispersed, they fill the five viscera. No greater art of nurturing life exists, and within it lies the fullness of longevity.\n\nThe ancient sage said: *\"To know harmony is to know constancy.\"* Liezi declared: *\"The waxing and waning of the one body all communicate with heaven and earth, resonating with the ten thousand kinds. Harmonious at the beginning, harmonious at the end—still the spirit, extinguish thought, and therein lies the Way of life.\"* Such is the subtlety of advancing in the profound mystery.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFrom cinnabar peaks, phoenix and simurgh alight in the jade tower,\nIn the secret hall, the *Xiaoshao* hymn plays its nine movements.\nThe rustic elder knows not the honor of the imperial carriage,\nYet through the six streets still echoes the sound of the silent whip.\n\n**186. Beyond the One Hue**\nIn the practice of the profound mystery, when one reaches the state of utter supreme harmony, a single hue, the work of nine returns and seven reversals is already accomplished. Ascending further, the very void shatters, effortlessly transcending all, abiding neither in the one hue nor in the mysterious wondrous. Freed from the body, without reliance—only then is it called \"transcending the norm.\"\n\nThus, the ancient worthies said: *\"When the one hue dissolves, only then is it called noble. Shifting one’s step in subtlety, the crane escapes the silver cage. Turning within the station, the moon spreads gold upon the earth.\"* Dongshan remarked: *\"White powder cannot conceal traces, Chang’an is no place for long abiding.\"* For though Chang’an is fine, it is not a home for lingering. Turning to the next station, not dwelling in nobility, one naturally cannot be confined.\n\nIf one clings to the edge of the one hue, to the station of purity, one still falls into the rut—how could this accord with the supreme mystery of the Dao?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHaving grasped the principle of emptiness,\nOne follows illumination to forget the nature.\nUnless merit and power are exhausted,\nHow can one avoid awaiting the Empty King?\n\n(*The Heavenly Music Collection* concludes)\n\n**Appendix: Six Texts**\n\n**Appendix I: Responses to Ten Questions from Gentleman Tang Muxuan**\n**By the Hermit of Haiyin Mountain**\n\n**1. On the Stages of Learning the Dao—Please Outline the General Framework.**\n**Answer:** The stages of learning the Dao may be summarized in four steps: faith, understanding, practice, and realization. This is the broad outline.\n\nFaith is the first step, and understanding the second. Faith must be deep, and understanding must be thorough. For example, if one resolves to journey to Wudang Mountain in Hubei to pay homage, one must firmly believe in the existence of the Taihe immortal realm and the possibility of reaching it. Understanding means clearly grasping the route—knowing the land and water paths, as well as the conditions for food and lodging along the way—and preparing sufficient travel funds. Practice entails personally traversing the terrain, advancing according to the predetermined route. Realization is attained upon reaching the destination, where one abides in freedom and enjoys the fullness of the Way. Realization has varying depths, but liberation is the ultimate goal. Until liberation is achieved, one remains in the stage of practice and cannot be said to have entered realization.\n\nBy \"liberation,\" I mean transcending the Five Turbidities, surpassing the Three Realms, and escaping both the segmental and transformative forms of birth and death. For beginners, faith and understanding are urgent tasks. Once practice begins and understanding is transcended, realization becomes the ultimate aim.\n\n**2. On the Stages of Cultivating the Dao—Please Also Outline the General Framework.**\n**Answer:** Tanzi’s *Book of Transformations* states: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi; forget qi to nourish spirit; forget spirit to nourish emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.\"* This is the general framework of the stages.\n\nThus, Master Bai said: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi, and qi transforms into spirit—this is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.\"* Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it has been commonly said: *\"Refine essence into qi, refine qi into spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness.\"* However, this is not as all-encompassing as Master Tan’s teaching.\n\n**3. Today, many study the Dao, but none are heard to have attained it. Where lies the crux of the problem? Can you point it out?**\n**Answer:** \"Studying the Dao\" is a general term. Among those who use it, some are sincere in their pursuit, aiming to transcend birth and death; others seek fame and profit, using it as a pretense; some follow along temporarily but soon abandon it, beginning without perseverance; and others blindly follow false teachers, practicing without guidance. All call themselves Dao-seekers, but most do not align with the Dao.\n\nLet us focus on those who genuinely study the Dao to transcend birth and death: some encounter true teachers, while others do not; some receive complete instructions from true teachers, while others only learn preliminary practices or obtain only half the method. Even among those who are sincere, have met true teachers, and received complete instructions, some face various obstacles that hinder their practice; others procrastinate until their allotted time runs out, leaving no opportunity for cultivation; and some are able to let go of everything, advancing without hindrance—these are those whose virtue is sufficient and whose Dao is complete, thus fulfilling their aspirations.\n\nGenerally, cultivating the Dao must be supported by virtue. Those lacking in virtue often encounter demonic obstacles when attempting to practice. I have witnessed this many times. For example, if you have long resided in an inn, accumulating unpaid debts for room and board, you may continue staying without immediate reckoning. But if you decide to leave for elsewhere, the innkeeper and attendants will demand a full settlement of all accounts before allowing you to depart. This world within the Three Realms is like an inn where we have lodged for kalpas, accruing countless karmic debts from past lives. If you vow to transcend birth and death and leave the Three Realms, all past karmic debts must be settled at once—otherwise, there will be no future opportunity for repayment. This is why, in *Journey to the West*, the moment Tang Monk vows to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven, eighty-one tribulations arise. Few attain the Dao, half due to not meeting true teachers, and half due to their own procrastination or karmic obstructions.\n\n**4. Should those who study immortality eat meat or abstain from it? If one studies Buddhism, the teachings are explicit—this is not an issue. However, alchemical texts contain no precepts mandating vegetarianism for Dao cultivators. Conversely, Master Sanfeng said: *\"Drink wine, eat meat, yet keep a vegetarian’s diet of wine and meat in the belly.\"* He also told Layman Wang: *\"For those who abstain from meat, I say: ‘A kind heart surpasses a kind mouth; it suffices to follow the gentleman’s teaching to stay far from the kitchen.’\"* The *Daoist Ballad* states: *\"Do not abstain from meat or commit lust, for lust forfeits the treasure of long life; wine and meat pass through the intestines, but the Dao resides in the heart.\"* This clearly permits meat-eating.\n\nYet I wonder: why does Buddhism enforce precepts while Daoism relaxes them? Are their teachings so divergent? Do you eat meat or abstain? On this matter, what insights can you offer to guide later learners?**\n**Answer:** In my work *Random Notes on the Treasures of the Dao*, there is a discussion on the meat-eating question. When I have time, I will excerpt and submit it for publication in this journal. This issue pertains to the cultivation of virtue.\n\nWe who practice the Dao are descendants of the ancient sages and must naturally adhere to the ancestral teachings. Among the Three Treasures of the ancient sages, compassion is foremost. It is said: *\"Thus the sage constantly excels in saving beings, and so abandons none.\"* And: *\"Heaven will save them, with compassion as their defense.\"* Because people eat meat, nets are cast in the mountains and forests, and traps are set in the depths of waters. Oxen and sheep, large creatures, and fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs, small ones, are captured and slaughtered without respite.\n\nJust ask yourself: does this accord with the ancient sages’ principle of *\"great compassion as foremost\"* and their teaching of *\"constantly excelling in saving beings\"*? If you admire and emulate the sages’ way of *\"long life and enduring vision\"* yet reject and discard their injunctions to *\"practice great compassion, save all beings, and remain tranquil and free from desire,\"* then you become self-serving and profit-seeking, turning your back on the sages and betraying the Dao. In such a case, your virtue will be insufficient, and you will find it difficult to attain immortality.\n\nIf you truly desire long life, you must also wish for every being to enjoy long life and fulfill its true nature. Only then will you align with the spirit of great compassion. Among those who have eloquently discussed immortality, none surpass *Baopuzi*. In its second scroll, *\"On Immortality,\"* it states: *\"The method of learning immortality requires tranquility, joy, and detachment, cleansing oneself of cravings and desires.\"* It further says: *\"The Dao of immortality demands love extended even to creeping insects, never harming any sentient being.\"* And again: *\"The Dao of immortality requires abstaining from foul and rank foods, fasting to purify the intestines.\"*\n\nIn *\"Subtle Principles,\"* it declares: *\"Those who seek long life must accumulate merit, cultivate compassion toward all beings, extend empathy to others, and show kindness even to insects.\"* All these teachings align perfectly with the *Daodejing*. Yet if one kills beings to nourish oneself, how far does this stray from the precepts of *\"kindness extended to insects, love extended to creeping things, never harming sentient beings\"*? And how far does it depart from the admonition to *\"cleanse oneself of cravings and desires\"*?\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: *\"A kind heart surpasses kind words; embody the noble person’s teaching to distance oneself from the kitchen.\"* He continues: *\"Nurturing qi naturally nourishes the body; one should follow the perfected person’s prohibition against foul odors.\"* This clearly shows that harmonious food suffices to nourish the five viscera, rendering unnecessary the *Inner Canon*’s dictum that *\"those deficient in essence should supplement it with flavors.\"*\n\nThe *\"perfected person’s prohibition against foul odors\"* means abstaining from meat, as the *Analects* states: *\"Food of displeasing color or foul odor is not eaten.\"* Between mouth and heart, a kind heart is naturally superior to kind words. Yet how much more sublime is it to observe the precepts with urgency, cultivating both heart and speech in perfect harmony!\n\nI observe that Master Feng’s words are boundlessly harmonious, yet you cling only to his opening line while neglecting what follows—this becomes a one-sided view. The phrase *\"wine and meat pass through the intestines, but the Dao resides in the heart\"* should be weighed by its final three characters. Today’s people let wine and meat fill their bellies while their hearts remain devoid of the Dao, indulging only in flavors and yielding to the five desires. Their state is worlds apart from Master Sanfeng’s realm, so one cannot seize upon this line to raise objections.\n\nIn essence, both immortals and buddhas prize a pure and tranquil heart. If the mouth craves fish and meat, the eyes will crave the five colors, and the ears will crave the five sounds. Dwelling daily amid the realm of the five desires, one risks losing resonance with the pure heart. Moreover, killing living beings accumulates karmic enmity: if I harm others, they will seek to harm me in turn. Cause and effect circulate without the slightest deviation. We who cultivate the Dao must urgently clear our past debts and lighten our karmic obstructions—how can we incur new ones?\n\nI myself began studying the Dao at nineteen, eating meat as circumstances allowed. Not until twenty-seven did I encounter *The Myriad Goodnesses Resource Collection* by Zhou Anshi of the early Qing—a most excellent book. After reading it repeatedly, a heart of compassion arose spontaneously within me. I realized that killing to sustain one’s own life contradicts the great compassionate principle, harms heavenly harmony, depletes hidden virtue, and violates the benevolent teachings of Confucius and Laozi. It was time to change course.\n\nYet old habits die hard. After a few days of vegetarianism, cravings for meat returned. Adapting to the circumstances, I alternated between meat and vegetarian meals, while ceasing to kill any living beings—no fish, shrimp, or other creatures were purchased. Whenever I had spare money each month, I bought animals to release in acts of liberation. After more than a year of this practice, I finally adopted a pure vegetarian diet, which I have maintained for seventeen or eighteen years now.\n\nBoth immortals and buddhas triumph through a heart of compassion, seeing all beings as oneself. Ancient legends speak of the Compassionate Immortal and the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering. If you take compassion as your guiding principle, then abstaining from meat and refraining from killing will pose no difficulty. How can you doubt this simply because it is absent from the immortals’ scriptures?\n\nConfucius said: *\"Loyalty and forbearance are not far from the Dao. What you do not wish for yourself, do not impose upon others.\"* Zengzi said: *\"The Master’s Dao consists solely of loyalty and forbearance.\"* Setting aside profound theories, the proverb says: *\"Put yourself in another’s place.\"* If you do not wish to be harmed or killed, yet daily wield blades against defenseless creatures, this is a failure of forbearance. The ancient sages taught compassion and protection, yet you turn your back on them, slaughtering lives to fill your belly—this is a failure of loyalty.\n\nAll creatures, however humble, possess sentience. This sentience is no different in essence from that of a sage who has attained the fruit. To destroy sentient beings is to lack benevolence. Thus, this matter bears profoundly on the cultivation of virtue. If you claim that one whose humanity is incomplete can still attain the immortal Dao, I remain skeptical.\n\n**Five:** What distinguishes the cultivation and realization of immortals and buddhas?\n**Answer:** After all, water flows eastward to the sea; in the end, clouds must seek their mountain home.\n\n**Six:** How do the attainments of immortals and buddhas compare in superiority?\n**Answer:** When clouds settle, every home has its moon; when spring arrives, every tree blooms with flowers.\n\n**Seven:** Does studying immortality hinder worldly engagement? Does worldly engagement hinder the study of immortality?\n**Answer:** Dense bamboo does not obstruct flowing water; how can high mountains block the flight of white clouds?\n\n**Eight:** What constitutes the family style of a Daoist?\n**Answer:** Walk with unhurried steps, speak in a low voice, attend to each breath, and distance the heart from thoughts. Only when you cast off all ties and return to the mountains will true freedom and ease manifest.\n\n**Nine:** You must have read many alchemical texts—with which do you most resonate?\n**Answer:** *The Collected Works of Master Bai*.\n\n**Ten:** Regarding *The Seventeen Daoist Books*, are they orthodox or heterodox?\n**Answer:** One who has wandered through the Dragon Canon will naturally discern at a glance. But if one was born in a thatched hut, let them be dazzled by the five colors. The worst is like Zhu Bajie eating the ginseng fruit—swallowing it whole and then asking what it tasted like! Never mind the taste—why must the ginseng fruit grow in the Wuzhuang Temple? What is the Wuzhuang Temple? What is the ginseng fruit?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix II: Five Letters in Reply to a Friend**\n**By Haiyin Mountain Man**\n**First Letter**\n\nWang Menglou of the Qing devoted his life to Buddhist study, then turned to immortality in his eighties, exchanging poems with immortals. Your letter asks, *\"Why descend in old age?\"*—this is a misunderstanding. The study of the Dao aims to resolve the three sufferings of old age, sickness, and death. At eighty, one is already aged: vitality wanes, steps falter, and eating becomes difficult. Hearing and sight lose their acuity; hair turns white, the face wrinkles, and death draws near.\n\nAt such a time, if someone could relieve one’s immediate suffering, the heart would gladly follow. This is the natural inclination of human nature. Menglou had a deep affinity for Chan, yet in his exchanges with immortals, they must have transmitted to him arts for prolonging life and dispelling illness—methods for regulating breath and calming the spirit—so that he might attain true benefit and resolve the vexations of old age and sickness. While the Buddha’s teachings are lofty, many discuss its principles, but few have realized them in practice. To claim that the sufferings of old age and sickness cannot be resolved, yet the suffering of death can; or that one cannot attain sagehood in this life, but can after death—these are nothing but self-deception and deceiving others.\n\nThe Daoist tradition values only the present moment: if one can calm the spirit and harmonize the breath to gain true benefit, the future will reveal itself without inquiry. Thus, the Daoist path is like a merchant acquiring goods—demanding immediate payment, not promissory notes, and disdaining credit. Today’s Buddhists, however, seek future rewards, rebirth after death, all relying on promissory notes. Yet when the note comes due, whether it can be honored remains uncertain. The proverb says, *\"Rejecting cash in hand for credit\"*—this perfectly captures the mindset of most Buddhists today.\n\nHave you not read the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, the earliest Buddhist text translated into Chinese? The Buddha asked how long a person’s life lasts, and none of his disciples’ answers satisfied him. Finally, one replied, *\"It lasts but a single breath.\"* The Buddha praised him, saying he understood the Way. What does this mean? How is breath related to the Dao? Know this: where breath resides, the Dao resides. Since life exists in the space between breaths, why not, before the breath ceases, calm the spirit and regulate the breath to avoid bankruptcy? If one waits until the breath is cut off, the cash is already spent. Even with a promissory note, where can it be redeemed? How can one bear to wait for bankruptcy—is this not delusion?\n\n**Second Letter**\n\nYour letter says that *\"life lasts but a single breath\"* merely illustrates its brevity—*\"the incoming breath does not guarantee the outgoing.\"* My brother, you have grasped only half of it. If the Buddha meant only to speak of brevity, he would have said, *\"Excellent! You understand time,\"* not *\"Excellent! You understand the Way.\"* Clearly, this is not a matter of time.\n\nThe Dao resides in the space between breaths—this is the meaning of *\"regulating breath and calming the spirit.\"* Breath is the wind-like aspect of the heart-mind. When breath is regulated, the heart-mind is settled; when breath is harmonious, the heart-mind is at peace. When one is enraged, the heart-mind rages, and the breath grows coarse. During a race, the heart-mind races, and the breath becomes short. The dead have no breath because the heart-mind has departed; the heart-mind in samadhi has no breath because it is quiescent. Thus, from having breath to regulating it until there is no breath—when external respiration ceases entirely—then the heart-mind has no arising or ceasing. With no arising or ceasing of the heart-mind, no inhalation or exhalation of breath, the state of great samadhi emerges, and the Dao abides there.\n\nHave you not seen the words of Prajñātāra, the twenty-seventh patriarch of Chan, in reply to the King of East India? He said: *\"This poor monk’s exhalation does not follow the myriad conditions; his inhalation does not dwell in the skandhas. Constantly turning the sutra thus for hundreds of thousands of millions of volumes—not merely one or two.\"* Prajñātāra took the regulation of inhalation and exhalation as the turning of the sutra—turning the sutra of one’s own body, not another’s. When spirit and breath are harmoniously blended, continuous yet imperceptible, the inner landscape is pure and still, the outer world empty and merged—is this not what is meant by *\"exhalation does not follow the myriad conditions, inhalation does not dwell in the skandhas\"*? This is the practice Laozi described as *\"focusing qi to attain suppleness, embracing the soul and holding to the One.\"*\n\nTurning another’s sutra brings great merit, but turning the sutra of one’s own true breath brings even greater merit. Turning the sutra of written words brings great merit, but turning the sutra of wordless truth brings even greater merit. Yet people abandon the near to seek the far, crave the lofty but neglect the practical. If one cannot even master a single breath, how can one speak of anything else?\n\nToday, there are millions of Buddhists, yet all disregard the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, dismissing it as too simple. The meaning of *\"life lasts but a single breath\"* eludes them entirely. They vainly hope to attain Buddhahood in this very body, yet possess not a shred of the capital required—like a pauper with not a single coin dreaming of becoming the owner of Yong’an Xianshi, the grandest amusement company before Liberation. How absurd!\n\nThe *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections* is the first step in Buddhist practice. Establishing the Dao within the space between breaths is its very essence. The Daoist *Huangting Jing* says: *\"Behind lies the secret chamber, before the gate of life; sun emerges, moon enters—breath abides.\"* Chen Xubai said: *\"Breath comes and goes without interruption; the sacred embryo is perfected, returning to the primordial.\"* Xu Jinyang said: *\"Internally harmonize true qi with breath; naturally, the transformations restore youthful countenance.\"* Li Daochun said: *\"Opening and closing respond to heaven and earth—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female. From no exit or entry, one alone reigns over the three realms.\"* And again: *\"Carefully observe the books of the sages of the Three Teachings—the character ‘breath’ is simplest. If one works on the practice of breath, becoming a Buddha or an immortal requires no effort.\"* Zheng Heyang said: *\"Where there is a heart-mind, there is breath; heart-mind and breath depend on each other and cannot be separated.\"*\n\n\"Reversing breath harms the heart-mind,\nForcing heart-mind and breath to prey upon each other.\nWhen heart-mind and breath prey upon each other, the six demons attack,\nAnd the celestial soul is driven into the realm of ghosts.\n\nMaster Ju said: *Breath is the root of all virtues in one’s own heart-mind.\nWhen breath flows smoothly, the heart-mind is at peace, and the hundred limbs are at ease—\nThe great treasury of radiant light stands firm as bedrock.\nRound and fluid, not a speck of shadow clings,\nNature and life pure and boundless, matching heaven itself.*\n\nŚākyamuni’s subtle words spoke of nothing else,\nLaozi’s *Dao and Virtue* all concern this.\nYanzi found joy in his bamboo bowl and gourd ladle,\nClearly seeing that breath abides—never daring to slacken.\n\nThough one may expound ten thousand classics and a thousand scriptures,\nAll rest in the realm of settled heart-mind and breath.\"\n\nObserve the final line, and the phrase *\"when breath flows smoothly, the heart-mind is at peace, and the hundred limbs are at ease,\"* and you will grasp the meaning of *The Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*—that the Dao resides in the space between breaths, where in a single inhalation and exhalation, the wondrous practice of establishing the Dao-ground is perfected.\n\n*The Treatise on Consciousness-Only* may be fine,\nBut it cannot cure white hair or stomach ailments—\nNot like the wondrous simplicity of returning wind and blending it,\nWhere breath alone suffices.\n\nIs this so? Reflect carefully upon it!\n\n**Three**\n**Unobstructed**\n\nYour letter suggests setting aside the Lesser Vehicle’s *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections* to discuss the Great Vehicle’s *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*. Very well—let us speak of these two.\n\nHave you not seen that among the *Śūraṅgama*’s twenty-five sages who attained perfect penetration, two achieved the exhaustion of outflows and realized arhatship precisely through regulating the breath? The first was Śroṇa Koṭīkarṇa, who declared: *“When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, as I have realized it, reversing the breath to merge with emptiness—this is foremost.”* The second was Sundarananda, who said: *“When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, I dissolved my thoughts, and through long-continued breath-regulation, illumination arose, outflows were extinguished, and this—this is foremost.”* What is meant by “reversing the breath to merge with emptiness”? It is the cessation of external respiration, the transformation of qi into spirit, and the radiance of spirit-light.\n\nFurthermore, in the *Śūraṅgama*’s ten stages of abiding, the phrase *“body and mind unite and grow daily”* describes the interdependence of heart-mind and breath in forming the sacred embryo. *“Having roamed within the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the lineage of awakening; as the embryo matures, the human marks are complete.”* It also states: *“The ten spiritual marks of the body are simultaneously perfected.”* And again: *“Having taken form and emerged from the embryo, one is personally a Buddha-child—this is called the abiding of the Dharma Prince.”* Here, the Dao-embryo is fully realized, and the true person appears.\n\nPeople know only that the *Śūraṅgama* criticizes the ten kinds of immortals, yet they do not realize these immortals belong to the earthly immortals—mere Lesser Vehicle practitioners of immortality. The lineage transmitted beneath the pillar aligns with the *Śūraṅgama*’s ten stages of abiding. Within this profound mystery, those who receive the true transmission understand it for themselves. Among the Great Vehicle scriptures, none so wondrously accords with the esoteric teaching of *“regulating the breath to form the embryo, nurture the embryo, and emerge from the embryo”* as the *Śūraṅgama*.\n\nThe Tiantai school’s contemplative teachings hold that in a single lifetime, one can only attain the initial stage of perfect abiding. Yet in the esoteric tradition’s cultivation and realization, a single lifetime can indeed attain all ten stages of abiding. Those of superior capacity, having realized the ten stages, leap directly into the two wisdoms of equal and wondrous enlightenment. For once the ten stages of abiding are complete, one has attained the Dharma-body, with boundless lifespan—free to roam and cultivate the Dao. The most difficult part is entering the abiding from the state of an ordinary being. How does one enter the abiding? The abiding is constant abiding; if one dies, one does not understand constant abiding. Constant abiding is longevity—both life and nature are eternally abiding.\n\nSetting aside the *Śūraṅgama* for now, let us turn to the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *Chapter on Leaving the Worldly*, which expounds the ten kinds of freedom. The first is *“freedom of life”*—abiding in lifespan for incalculable eons. Is this not the Buddha’s longevity? Have you not also seen in the *Entering the Dharma Realm* chapter that Sudhana visited the bhikṣu Ocean Banner, who had transcended inhalation and exhalation, without any other thoughts or perceptions, and entered the great quiescent samādhi, remaining in that samādhi for six months and six days before emerging? What is meant by *“transcending inhalation and exhalation, without any other thoughts or perceptions”* is precisely the esoteric tradition’s state of *“dual extinction of breath and thought, dual stabilization of body and mind”*—what Master Huzi called *“the Great Thoroughfare, without trace.”* The Great Thoroughfare is the image of emptiness and quiescence; *“without trace”* means no sign is discernible, like the antelope hanging its horns—no trail can be found. This great samādhi was attained by the bhikṣu Ocean Banner, and it is also attained by the esoteric tradition’s good spiritual friends. If, in samādhi, the heart-mind abides but the breath does not, this is only a semblance of quiescent extinction, not true quiescent extinction. Such a person, if their breath were obstructed during samādhi, would be unable to maintain it. Thus, only samādhi without breath is true samādhi. Samādhi with breath is worthless—still water does not harbor dragons. How could one then perfect the ten spiritual marks of the body simultaneously, emerge from the embryo, and personally become a Buddha-child?\n\nFurthermore, in the *Entering the Dharma Realm* chapter, Sudhana’s fiftieth visit was to the youth Virtue-Born and the maiden Virtue-Girl. Their city was called *Wondrous Intention Flower Gate*, and the Dharma-gate they taught was called *Liberation through Illusory Abiding*—this too conceals the secret meaning of *“heart-mind and breath interdependent, harmonizing in samādhi.”* Observe that all the good spiritual friends Sudhana had previously visited were solitary individuals, but here they appear as a pair—what else could this signify but the representation of one yin and one yang, the symbolic harmony of heart-mind and breath? The youth and maiden lived and traveled together. In terms of cultivation, at the stage of fruition, samādhi and wisdom harmonize as a pair; at the stage of practice, heart-mind and breath harmonize as a pair. The word *“wondrous”* is also symbolic—it is one yin and one yang. *“Wondrous Intention Flower Gate”* is akin to the Laozi’s *“Gate of the Myriad Wonders”* and *“Mysterious Female Gate.”* At the moment when heart-mind and breath harmonize, there arises a subtle mutual awareness. When, in quiescent stabilization, yang is born, the time arrives and spirit knows—like a child recognizing its mother. It is wondrous beyond words—is this not *“wondrous intention”*? Heart-mind and breath follow each other, phoenixes in harmony, a natural union of husband and wife. Yet the man does not loosen his robe, nor the woman untie her sash—they revere each other as divine, cherish each other as their own child. Is this not *“illusory abiding”*? Thus it is called *“liberation through illusory abiding.”* Only when one reaches the great samādhi, the true samādhi—without going or coming, without exiting or entering, forgetting both inner and outer, body and mind both quiescent, emptiness without reliance—is this called *“non-abiding.”* From illusory abiding, one attains non-abiding—here, the work of esoteric cultivation is complete.\n\nThe sūtra further states: *“At that time, the youth and maiden, having expounded their own liberation, used the power of inconceivable roots of goodness to make Sudhana’s body soft and radiant.”* The commentary explains: *“Softness”* refers to the state where, through the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, the entire body becomes supple and pliant. Bai Ziqing said: *“After you practice for two or three days, heaven and earth, sun and moon will become soft as silk.”* This is the true effect.\n\nThe radiance refers to the effervescence of primordial yang’s luminous *qi* upon the skin, manifesting externally. *The Yellow Court Scripture* states: *“The body generates radiant splendor, its qi fragrant as orchids.”* Master Zhongli Quan said: *“Jade-like nectar flows and glistens, giving rise to luminosity.”* Both express the same meaning. This is the sign of the fiftieth visitation, deeply resonant with the esoteric Daoist tradition. Yet all previous commentators on the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* have spoken only of principle, interpreting the youth and maiden as symbols of *samādhi* and *prajñā*. But for those still in the causal stage—ordinary beings without *samādhi* or *prajñā*—how should they begin their practice? The wondrous gateway of the Flower Adornment City exists within every person. Once the masters point out the mysterious pass, one naturally understands. Such profound and subtle manifestations are not easily discussed with outsiders. For this reason, over the past twenty years, I have never revealed this, fearing it might invite slander. Now, for my brother’s sake, I speak of it—perhaps you may glimpse another heaven and earth, the sun and moon within the gourd, the liberation of illusory abiding, and the truly inconceivable spiritual efficacy.\n\n---\n\nYour letter states: *“The immortals value longevity, while Buddhists value non-arising.”* Know that “non-arising” means not clinging to the appearance of arising, not that one becomes like withered wood or cold ashes, utterly devoid of vitality. If one were truly like withered wood or cold ashes, one would fall into the nihilistic heterodoxy, far from the Buddha’s true intent of neither arising nor ceasing. Laozi said: *“That by which heaven and earth endure so long is their non-self-arising; thus they attain long life.”* “Non-self-arising” means not clinging to arising—true arising without arising. *The Song of Enlightenment by Yongjia* says: *“Who is without thought? Who is without arising? Truly, without arising, there is nothing that does not arise.”* This means that if one realizes the principle of non-arising, one is also without death—thus, without arising yet nothing unarisen. In this light, Laozi’s “long life” does not fall into eternalism, nor does the Buddha’s “non-arising” fall into annihilationism. Without arising yet arising—this is the Buddha; arising yet without arising—this is the immortal. How can one rigidly divide them and rank their superiority? Understanding this, one knows there is no immortal who is not a Buddha, no Buddha who is not an immortal. True non-arising is true long life; true long life is wondrous accord with true non-arising. At this point, the barriers between the Daoist and Buddhist traditions may be entirely dismantled.\n\nNowadays, followers of the Buddha, upon hearing of longevity, dismiss it as heterodoxy, contrary to the Buddha’s original intent. They do not realize that the Buddha, for those attached to the vital essence and whose emotional views remain unbroken, teaches non-arising. But if one’s emotional views are already shattered, it is precisely then that one should be taught longevity. The *Lotus Sūtra* reveals the provisional to manifest the real; the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* exhausts all emotional measures—both reveal the secret of the freely commanded life. In the final teaching of *Nirvāṇa*, entering great *nirvāṇa* means neither aging nor dying, perfectly in harmony with the Yellow and Lao of the East. How can one rigidly adhere to one side, assigning non-arising to Buddhism and longevity to Daoism, exalting non-arising while disparaging longevity? Know that non-arising and longevity are merely different approaches to cultivation and subjugation.\n\n---\n\nWhile the *Śūraṅgama* and *Avataṃsaka* sūtras already interweave the paths of immortals and Buddhas, the most wondrous of all is the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*. Mahākāśyapa asked the Buddha: *“How does one attain long life, an indestructible vajra-body, and through what causes and conditions does one gain great, unshakable power?”*—this is openly inquiring about longevity. The *Four Marks Chapter* states: *“It is like a potter who, having made a vessel, eventually breaks it. Liberation is not like this. True liberation is neither arising nor ceasing; therefore, liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is also thus: neither arising nor ceasing, neither aging nor dying, neither breaking nor decaying, not a conditioned dharma. For this reason, it is called the Tathāgata. Entering great *nirvāṇa*, neither aging nor dying—what does this mean? Aging is called change: hair turning white, skin wrinkling, body decaying, life ending. Such things do not exist in liberation; because they are absent, it is called liberation. The Tathāgata also has no conditioned dharmas like white hair or wrinkled skin; therefore, the Tathāgata is without aging. Without aging, there is no death. Furthermore, liberation is called freedom from illness. What is illness? The four hundred and four diseases, along with other external harms that injure the body—these do not exist in liberation; thus, it is called liberation. Without illness, this is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is without illness; therefore, the Dharma-body is also without illness. Such freedom from illness is the Tathāgata. Death is called the decay of the body and the end of life; where there is no death, this is ambrosia. Ambrosia is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata possesses such merits—how can one say the Tathāgata is impermanent? If one claims impermanence, this is impossible. How can the vajra-body be impermanent? Therefore, the Tathāgata is not said to have a life’s end.”*\n\nIn this passage, the Tathāgata extensively demonstrates that those who attain true liberation are neither arising nor ceasing, neither breaking nor decaying, neither aging nor dying, and are free from the unsightly marks of white hair and wrinkled skin. Free from illness, this is no different from the immortals’ long life—one might say the immortal and the Buddha are of one breath, like water and milk perfectly blended. Yet how is it that today’s Buddhists, puffed up with self-importance, look down upon the immortal tradition as heterodoxy, dismissing it as one of the seven destinies? They themselves cannot escape illness, nor can they avoid the changes of white hair and wrinkled skin—no different from ordinary people. What, then, is the meaning of great *nirvāṇa*? What is true liberation? The wonder of ambrosia need not even be mentioned.\n\nOne must know that after the World-Honored One’s passing, those who grasped the profound purport of *mahāparinirvāṇa*—of neither aging nor dying—were found in the Mystery Tradition. Thus Wang Wenzhi, after broadly studying the Buddha’s teachings, at over eighty years of age suddenly turned to the Dao and followed immortals in their wanderings.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix III: An Entry from the Diary of Elder Li Tingguang**\n\nMaster Songyao said: “Mr. Wang Dongting propagated the Dao in Shanghai for decades yet could not attain the Way himself, his years having already declined into old age. When Master Hanxu arrived, he taught him the method of *tou-tai duo-she* (rebirth through seizing a womb). At the time of Mr. Dongting’s passing, he instructed him (referring to Xu Songyao) to seek him out at a certain time and place (referring to Wang Dongting). However, as war was imminent, he (Xu Songyao) was unable to go. I believe that as long as one does not forget their ‘original true nature,’ *tou-tai duo-she* remains possible.”\n\n*(This diary entry was provided by Mr. Lin Feng of Shanghai. Mr. Li Tingguang once studied under Xu Songyao, also known as Haiyinzi. In the mid-20th century, Li Tingguang and six others—Jiang Weiqiao, Hu Meicheng, Lu Zidong, Chu Xiangjiang, Gu Boshu, and Lu Huaidao—formed the ‘Seven Gentlemen’s Tea Gathering for Nurturing Life,’ exploring Daoist scholarship. It is said that Li Hanxu, the founding patriarch of the Western Lineage, personally came to Shanghai to transmit the *tou-tai duo-she* method to Ti Zhen Shanren Wang Dongting. According to *A Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu* by Li Daoshan of the Qing, Li Hanxu ascended in the year *bingchen* of the Xianfeng era (1856). Yet he manifested again in the world no later than the mid-20th century to transmit the teaching to Wang Dongting, more than sixty or seventy years after his passing. Mr. Lin Feng commented on this passage: ‘Upon first reading this, I was truly startled.’ How could I not feel the same! This also demonstrates the extraordinary efficacy of the ancient transmission of inner alchemy, and the truth of self-mastery and rebirth of life is not false. Daoist scholar Chen Yingning (1880–1969) once remarked: ‘Whether *tou-tai* is truly reliable—rather than being troubled by the inability to verify it with facts, one can only believe it to be extraordinary.’ This case is no different. Whether it is true or not, I do not know. It is merely appended here as documentary material, left for scientific researchers to investigate and verify! Furthermore, the method of *tou-tai duo-she* comprises four types: *tou-tai* (rebirth), *duo-she* (seizing a body), *jie-shi* (borrowing a corpse), and *zhuan-shi* (transmigration)—collectively known as the ‘Four Fruits.’”)*\n\n*—Gan Keqi’s note*\n\n---\n\n**Appendix IV: Excerpt from Mr. Hu Meicheng’s *Postscript to the Exegesis of Southern Lineage Alchemical Secrets***\n\n“In the early 20th century, I made three journeys to Suzhou and personally visited Xu Songyao, the renowned Daoist scholar of Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, known as Master Xuanjing. A graduate of Tsinghua University, Master Xu devoted his life to Daoist studies. In his later years, his disciples numbered in the thousands, and his *Collected Writings on Heavenly Joy* circulated widely. However, he avoided discussing the teachings of the Yin-Yang Lineage.”\n\n“The inner alchemical practice of Daoism, whether in solitary or dual cultivation, hinges upon the critical stage of *huo-zi yang-sheng* (the living child’s arousal) and the gathering of the medicine. Yet many Daoist texts do not speak of this openly—it remains an untransmitted secret. The *huo-zi* moment has three types: the true *zi* hour, the proper *zi* hour, and the false *zi* hour. When the living child’s yang arises, one ignites the fire and gathers the medicine. The medicine itself varies in maturity, distinguished as one yang, two yangs, or three yangs. The medicine is called the ‘true seed,’ hence Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* verse: ‘If the cauldron lacks the true seed, do not waste the furnace’s fire on an empty pot.’ Without receiving the true transmission, many find it difficult to recognize the authentic phenomenon of *huo-zi yang-sheng* when gathering the medicine. For instance, Daoist scholar Xu Songyao’s *Collected Writings on Heavenly Joy* states that when the pure yang *qi* stirs during quiet cultivation, the body may experience numbness, tingling, or twitching, and with each twitch, one circulates a minor celestial orbit, gradually gathering and accumulating. Alas! Numbness, lightness, heaviness, and the like are common ‘eight sensations’ in cultivation. To mistake these eight sensations for the *huo-zi yang-sheng* and the gathering of medicine is entirely mistaken. …If one cultivates quiet practice and mistakes the eight sensations for the arousal of yang, then rousing the yang becomes harmful, allowing the original *qi* to leak away and all prior efforts to be wasted—truly a pity.”\n\n*(This postscript by Mr. Hu Meicheng was provided by Mr. Lin Feng of Shanghai. Mr. Hu made three journeys to Suzhou to personally visit Xu Songyao and inquire about the teachings of the Yin-Yang Lineage, only to be told that Songyao ‘avoided discussing it.’ This avoidance was not due to ignorance of the Yin-Yang Lineage’s teachings but rather an unwillingness to speak of them, likely owing to unspoken difficulties. Consider Haiyin’s reply in *Answers to Ten Questions from Mr. Tang Muxuan*: when asked whether the *Seventeen Daoist Texts* were orthodox or heterodox, he said, ‘Having roamed the Dragon Treasury, one naturally distinguishes at a glance.’ Among the *Seventeen Daoist Texts* are included *The Heart Seal of the Mysterious Subtlety* and *The Alchemical Secrets of the Three Peaks*, both renowned works of the Yin-Yang Lineage. Since he claimed to ‘distinguish at a glance’ after perusing the Dragon Treasury, improper transmission would cause grave harm—hence his reticence.)*\n\nMoreover, it is commonly held that the Western Lineage is a dual-cultivation school of Yin and Yang. According to my understanding, the Western Lineage divides into two major transmission systems: one advocates solitary cultivation, the other dual cultivation. Yet the solitary-cultivation school is not without profound mastery of Yin-Yang studies, while the dual-cultivation school must also grasp the essence of solitary practice. Given the differences in time, place, and external conditions, each follows its own path to realization, though all ultimately converge. Those lacking the necessary external conditions keep their insights deeply concealed, remaining reticent to avoid unnecessary interference. As the *Classic of Purity* states: “If one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth all return.” If the essence of Heaven and Earth can be drawn in, how could the human element not be gathered as well?\n\nIn *The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Female Ancestor of the Mud-Pill Lineage*, compiled by Min Yide of the Qing in *Hidden Books of the Ancient Book Concealment Tower*, it is written: “Solitary cultivation is not the supreme Dao; of like kind, each naturally requires the other. Those who attain a body beyond the body can, through forgetfulness of form, accomplish all things.” It further states: “The human element pervades the great thousand worlds; the Three Elements are mastered by one heart. It is nothing beyond a heart serene and empty, nothing beyond a body free of obstruction. In movement and stillness, one harmonizes with the true constant; the self, without origin, naturally merges.” This teaching opens the eye of wisdom.\n\nThe Three Elements—Heaven, Earth, and Human—are such that “the human element pervades the great thousand worlds,” not confined to the crucible of the other household. The function of the Three Elements is entirely governed by the mastery of one heart. In essence, the method lies in “a heart serene and empty” and “a body free of obstruction,” which is to say, “forgetting both body and heart, entering the great samadhi of true emptiness”—this is none other than the principle that “if one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth all return.” If one can “forget form” and attain the state of “a body beyond the body,” then “all things can be accomplished.” Solitary is not merely solitary, dual not merely dual; “of like kind, each naturally requires the other.” As the *Cantong Qi* says: “Like a lodestone drawing iron, though separated by barriers, they communicate in secret.”\n\nThus, within solitary cultivation there is no absence of the principle of dual cultivation, and within dual cultivation there is also the work of purity. True cultivators may well integrate this pure method into dual practice, cultivating together with another, “roaming together in the boundless wilds,” and both will surely benefit, achieving the feat of husband and wife ascending as immortals! Though the dual-cultivation school possesses additional techniques such as “forging the sword” and “regulating the crucible,” with their own subtle methods, these are not as stable and free of pitfalls as the aforementioned approach, which anyone can verify without the need for additional precepts or constraints. Is this not what is meant by “its meaning most profound yet its traces most evident”?\n\nMr. Hu Meicheng further criticized the error of mistaking “tingling, numbness, and throbbing” for the arising of Yang and the production of medicine. The secret meaning of “tingling, numbness, and throbbing” may be found in detail in the *Collection of Celestial Joy*. Discerning scholars will surely understand what is indicated; I need not elaborate further.\n\nWei Yao, a fellow disciple of Haiyin, states in *The True Transmission of the Great Dao*: “Since ancient times, those who write books and establish teachings have all addressed the ills of their time.” The critiques of Haiyin and Meicheng are likewise corrective words aimed at contemporary errors. Take, for example, *The Immortal Lineage of Wu-Liu*, which emphasizes the stirring of the external kidneys as a sign of Yang arising. Those who do not comprehend the wondrous workings of nature cling to appearances and forms, failing to reach the state of “attaining emptiness” before vainly seeking the arising of Yang, even falling into attachment to sensual forms—how then can they speak of “abiding in constant purity”?\n\nThus, Haiyin wrote his books to correct the ills of his time, merely designating “softness, numbness, and tingling” as signs of Yang arising, so as not to lead beginners into attachment to form. If, within “attaining utmost emptiness and maintaining profound stillness,” one experiences “softness, numbness, and tingling,” progressing to “softness and bliss,” then the arising of Yang and the production of medicine occur naturally, and the source of medicine is as clear as pure water. What Mr. Meicheng criticized was indeed the error of mistaking the “eight sensations” for the arising of Yang and the failure to recognize the true signs of Yang arising.\n\nThe eight sensations are merely phenomena of the initial stage of entering stillness, signs of the first circulation of qi and blood and the initial quieting of the mind—far from reaching the level of “Yang arising and medicine producing.” With Mr. Meicheng’s vast knowledge, he naturally understood Haiyin’s intentions. Therefore, while Mr. Hu Meicheng’s critique is valid, the teachings of Haiyin also contain profound principles.\n\n—Noted by Sheng Keqi\n\n**Appendix V: Master Tian Chengyang’s Annotations on \"Benefits of Daoist Practice\" from *Secrets of Immortal Learning* Compiled by Haiyinzi**\n\nHaiyinzi was a master of the Western School. His practice focused on external cultivation, fundamentally distinct from the Wu-Liu School’s method of guarding the lower dantian. What, then, is this \"external cultivation\"?\n\nZhang Yishang, in his annotations to *Casual Discourses on Immortal Dao*, provides a detailed account, which we excerpt below:\n\n*\"The Western School transmits an exceptional Heavenly Origin Elixir Method, wherein the spirit is stabilized and the breath regulated at the point one *cun* outside the nose, where the two bodies intersect. When breath is present, the spirit rests in the void beyond the nose; when breath ceases, the spirit enters samādhi in that same void. This practice begins with this method and culminates in it.\"*\n\n*(Note: This annotation was provided by Mr. Zhang Tao of Tianmen, Hubei. Mr. Zhang Yishang, a native of Zhong County, Sichuan, possessed profound scholarship in both Buddhist and Daoist traditions.)*\n\nFrom the annotations in *Casual Discourses on Immortal Dao*, it is evident that Master Zhang possessed considerable knowledge of the Western School’s elixir methods, striking at the very essence of the practice in a single phrase—truly a work that \"paints the dragon and dots the eyes.\" Moreover, his designation of this method as the \"exceptional Heavenly Origin Elixir Method\" reveals his profound admiration. However, classifying it as a \"separate transmission of the Western School\" may not be entirely appropriate.\n\nThe Western School’s elixir studies are generally categorized under the yin-yang methods of the Human Origin Elixir tradition. Thus, the elder master, proceeding from this premise, labeled the Western School’s pure cultivation as a \"separate transmission.\" Whether the Western School’s elixir system belongs to the yin-yang tradition or the pure cultivation tradition—and which branch may be considered the orthodox transmission—was briefly addressed in my annotations to the excerpt from Master Hu Meicheng’s *Postscript to the Exegesis of Southern School Elixir Formulas*, and I shall not elaborate further here.\n\n*—Inscribed by Sheng Keqi*\n\n**Appendix VI: The Origins of Printing *The Celestial Music Collection***\n\nWorks on the esoteric arts abound like cattle filling a barn—many have I perused. Yet most conceal the mother in the child, veil the image in metaphor, and though readable, remain hard to grasp. Inevitably, one gropes like a blind man touching an elephant, misguessing and misconstruing, left only with a sense of gazing at the ocean and sighing in awe.\n\nLast autumn, in the year *guichou*, I sought the Way from the Elder of Hidden Valley. He graciously revealed the wondrous discourse on esoteric practice, imparting the essential subtleties of harmonizing heart and breath, and lent me *The Celestial Music Collection*. A cursory reading of but a few chapters sufficed to open my eyes and illumine my mind. Only then did I realize that the elixir formulas transmitted by the sages of old indeed had worthy successors.\n\n*The Celestial Music Collection* was composed by Master Xuanjing (Haiyin). Its contents are vast—reportedly spanning over one hundred scrolls in eight volumes. The copy I obtained comprises but a tenth of the whole. Yet even this partial glimpse reveals the culmination of the elixir formulas of all past sages. It dissects what earlier alchemical texts left unexamined, stripping away the skin to reveal the flesh, with every word guiding one toward sagehood. The arcane purports of the *Can Tong Qi*, *Wu Zhen Pian*, *Yin Fu Jing*, and *Dao De Jing* are laid bare without reservation. Every elixir formula and experiential insight is expounded in exhaustive detail—truly the great compendium of Daoist learning, the compass of elixir classics, and the key to the esoteric arts.\n\nMy fellow cultivator, Xueyangzi—though my senior in the lineage—is also my guide across the ford. The harmony of heart and breath, had he not first illuminated the path, how could I have grasped it so profoundly or embraced it so steadfastly? Bound by the fellowship of immortals, we resonate in voice and seek in kindred *qi*. All that we attain, we refine through mutual exchange, mutually enlightening one another as we advance together.\n\nI lament that fine books are hard to obtain yet easily lost, while lesser scholars cling to the false and stray from the real. *The Celestial Music Collection* resounds like celestial music in the void, suffusing the spirit and nurturing nature. Yet how many lovers of the Way will ever have the chance to read it?\n\nMindful of the deep bonds with my immortal brethren—Yunzhongzi, Qiqiaoxing, and others—and unwilling to hoard such treasures alone, I resolved to commission the printing of several copies to share with kindred spirits, that we might ascend the cloud-path together. Yet, burdened by worldly affairs and myriad obstructions, I had already pledged to oversee the *Immortal Dao Monthly*—now this vow to print *The Celestial Music* weighs upon me as well. Torn between the two, I can but sigh in helplessness.\n\nI consulted Xueyang, who, through the intercession of Tiyang, readily agreed without hesitation. Undaunted by the labor, he undertook to begin anew, and we settled on printing twenty copies. Such a noble-minded seeker of the Way, so generous in aiding the Dao, fills me with profound admiration and boundless gratitude.\n\nThus, I have prefaced this edition with a table of contents for ease of reference and briefly recounted its origins.\n\n**Tianlezi’s Inscribed Poems:**\n\n**I**\n\n**I**\nWho knows the move within the boundless void?\nA child of tiger’s den explores the dark and still.\nThe true midst Heaven and Earth—how vast, how wide!\nYin and yang’s limits: but a mote of dust.\nHeart and breath entwined birth the mystic aperture;\nFrom murky cosmos, cull the jade-like *zhi*.\nThe *Celestial Music* reveals its subtlest wonders,\nStark and bare, the truth laid bare as *tathatā*.\n\n**II**\nAs if immortal strains resound across the sky,\nOne drifts amid a blaze of heavenly blossoms.\nEach verse marks the marrow of the mystic spine;\nEach chapter mirrors the Buddha’s voice and face.\nOur homeland lies in the realm of *wuheyou*;\nOur visage belongs to the Lord of Vague Forms.\nFrom fine dust to the coarse Three Realms,\nWho but I dares laugh in the spring breeze?\n\n**III**\nA body beyond bodies, a grandfather beyond grandsons,\nThe ear bears the colossal staff that pierces heaven.\nHave you seen the *Sea-Print*’s wink, O Lord?\nI dare exhaust the craftsman’s artifice of heaven.\nThus I entrust the *Golden Lad* to carve anew,\nAnd bid the *Jade Maiden* hasten its completion.\nThe silk thread never slips—fit for angling;\nOnce the golden toad is hooked, I’ll seek the *Jade Palace*.\n\n**IV**\n*Qiangu* borrowed *The Celestial Music* to transcribe;\nThe Innocent One then entrusted it to *Tiyang*.\nEight-tenths of the work remained unfinished,\nYet one corner reflected the whole, all was complete.\nHenceforth, read by starlight and moonlight,\nEver revering each breath, pursuing with the heart.\nThe elixir that extends life and preserves the true—\nMay all the world partake of it together.\n\n**V**\nThe book remains, its author gone—deep regret!\nHow could I receive the *Voice of the Tide* in person?\nAfter *Dongting*, the former master’s line continues;\nSince *Xiyue*, I have taken up the mantle.\nI still recall *Qiangu* with longing,\nAnd ever remember the *Little Innocent One*.\nThe world’s affairs shift, human hearts are treacherous—\nOne must tread with care, as on thin ice.\n\n*Haiyin Shanren* Xu Songyao\n*The Celestial Music*",

      "translated_text": "**Editorial Notes on the Collation of *The Celestial Music Collection*\nSupplementary Collation Notes on *The Celestial Music Collection*\nSix Appendices**\n\n**I. Daoist Lineages**\nThe learning of the Daoist school, also called the Mysterious Learning, is the most ancient in China. Formerly, Duke Ai asked Zixia: “Did the Five Emperors have teachers?” Zixia replied: “Your servant has heard that the Yellow Emperor studied under Da Fen, Zhuanxu under Lu Tu, Ku under Chi Chengzi, Yao under Wu Chengzi, Shun under Yin Shou, Yu under the Queen Mother of the West, Tang under Cheng Bozi, King Wen under Xi Chouzi, King Wu under the Grand Duke, the Duke of Zhou under Guo Shu, and Confucius under Lao Dan. Without encountering these teachers, these eleven sages could not have established their achievements in the world or transmitted their names to later generations.”\n\nI note: Most of the eleven sages mentioned were ancient immortals. Ancient immortals manifesting in the world were too numerous to count. Among those who wrote books and established doctrines, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are foremost; today, Laozi is universally honored as the founding ancestor of the Dao. This is because Laozi composed the *Daodejing*, which expounded the profound mysteries of the Daoist school and became the model for later generations.\n\nLaozi transmitted his teachings to Chen Xiyi (Chen Tuan), Xiyi to the True Man of Fire Dragon, Fire Dragon to Zhang Sanfeng, and Sanfeng to Shen Wansan, Qiu Yuanjing, Master Li, and Wang Yuantong, among many other disciples. This lineage is known as the Wenshi (Literary Beginnings) School, also called the Hidden Immortals School.\n\n**II.**\nSecond, Laozi transmitted his teachings to Wang Xuanyu, styled Donghua, also called Shaoyang. Shaoyang transmitted to Zhongli Quan, known as Zhengyang. Zhengyang transmitted to Lü Yan, known as Chunyang. From Master Lü’s disciples emerged four branches:\n\n1. Lüzu transmitted to Yan Xiang Liu Haichan, and Haichan to Zhang Ziyang. Ziyang founded the Southern School.\n2. Lüzu transmitted to Wang Chongyang of the Southern Song, who established the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) Teaching and founded the Northern School.\n3. During the Jiajing reign of the Ming, Lüzu transmitted to Lu Xixing of Huaihai, styled Qianxu, founding the Eastern School.\n4. During the Daoguang reign of the Qing, Lüzu transmitted to Li Xiyue of Jiading, Sichuan, styled Hanxu, founding the Great River Western School.\n\nThis lineage is known as the Donghua School, also called the Shaoyang School.\n\nIn the Southern School, Ziyang transmitted to Shi Xinglin, Xinglin to Xue Zixian, Xue to Chen Niuwan, and Chen to Bai Ziqing. From Zhang to Bai, there were five transmissions, collectively known as the “Five Southern Patriarchs.” Ziqing transmitted to Peng Helin, Peng to Xiao Zixu, and thereafter the lamp of transmission was passed to many, all direct lineages of the Southern School.\n\nChongyang, a native of Xianyang, was of the Northern School. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song, he wandered to Mount Zhongnan, where he encountered the two patriarchs Zhong and Lü and cultivated the Dao in seclusion. Emerging from the pass, he established the Quanzhen Teaching and initiated Ma Danyang, Sun Bu’er, Qiu Chuji, Liu Chuxuan, Tan Chuduan, Wang Chuyi, and Hao Datong, who attained the Dao in succession. These seven are known as the “Seven Northern Perfected.”\n\nAmong the Seven Northern Perfected, the most far-reaching in their transmission of the teachings were Patriarch Ma and Patriarch Qiu. Those such as Song Piyun, Li Qizhen, Zhang Ziqiong, Zhao Yuandu, Chen Zhixu, and Zhang Tianyu were all descendants of Danyang’s lineage. Those such as the True Man Zhang of Tiger Skin Seat, Li Xu’an, Cao Huanyang, and Wu Chongxu were all descendants of Chuji’s lineage.\n\nThe Quanzhen Teaching flourished in the north. Reading Jin Xueshi Yuan’s *Record of the Purple Tenuity Abbey* (*Yishan Collection: Record of the Purple Tenuity Abbey*) provides an overview: “Since the Zhenyuan and Zhenglong eras, there has been the teaching of the Quanzhen School. Wang Zhongfu (i.e., Chongyang) of Xianyang initiated it, and Tan, Ma, Qiu, Liu, and others followed. It was based on the teachings of profound tranquility, without the absurdities of yellow-capped priests’ exorcisms, and incorporated the teachings of Chan meditation without the hardships of ascetic bondage. They tilled fields and dug wells, sustaining themselves, and extended their surplus to others. Compared to the tumult of the world, they seemed to live with ease. Thus, the indolent and indigent flocked to them. From the Huai River in the south to the deserts in the north, from Qin in the west to the sea in the east, mountain forests, cities, and dwellings stood in sight of one another, with groups of ten or a hundred. After the chaos of the Zhenyou and Xiang eras, when all standards of order and culture had collapsed, the restless people had nowhere to turn. The only teaching available was this one school. From this, one can see the flourishing of the Quanzhen Teaching and the immense benefit it brought to sentient beings—far beyond those who cultivate in seclusion in deep mountains, merely perfecting themselves.”\n\nThe lineage of the Eastern School has no surviving texts for reference. As for the Western School, Patriarch Li transmitted to Wu Tianzhi of Shaanxi, and Grand Preceptor Wu transmitted to Ke Baozhen of Hubei and my teacher, Master Wang Tizhen. From the founding ancestor to my teacher, six transmissions have spanned over two thousand years—a truly long span. This is the general succession of the Donghua and Wenshi lineages.\n\nFurther examination of *Marvelous Encounters in Mountains and Seas* reveals that Lüzu and Liu Haichan once transmitted the elixir formulas to Chen Xiyi, and the True Man Zhang Sanfeng also transmitted elixir formulas to Li Hanxu.

Xixing was born in Huaihai, and Xiyue in southern Sichuan, thereby becoming the founding ancestors of the Eastern and Western Schools respectively.\n\nMaster Wang observed: \"The Southern and Northern Schools both originated from the transmission of the two patriarchs, Zhongli and Lü. If one distinguishes them by geography, it is acceptable; but if one divides them by the Great Dao, such reasoning is unsound.\" This may be called an immutable truth.\n\nII. The Origins of the Dao\n\nFu Xi drew the trigrams, revealing the secrets of creation; Nüwa mended the heavens, disclosing the marvel of \"taking from Kan to fill Li,\" yet these were but images without written records. As for the teachings of self-cultivation, those set down in writing began with the words of Guangcheng to the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Renyou\" chapter states: \"When the Yellow Emperor had been on the throne for nineteen years, his decrees were implemented throughout the world. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelt on Mount Kongtong, he went to visit him, saying, 'I have heard that you, Master, have attained the Perfect Dao. May I venture to ask about the essence of the Perfect Dao? I wish to draw upon the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to ensure the flourishing of all living things. How may this be done?'\n\n\"Guangchengzi replied, 'What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to regulate is the dregs of things. Ever since you began governing the world, clouds have rained before gathering, plants and trees have withered before turning yellow, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. With the sly and flattering heart you possess, how could you be fit to speak of the Perfect Dao?'\n\n\"The Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white couch grass, and dwelt in seclusion for three months before returning to seek an audience. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from the lower side, crawling on his knees, bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and asked, 'I have heard that you, Master, have attained the Perfect Dao. May I venture to ask how to cultivate the body so as to attain longevity?'\n\n\"Guangchengzi rose abruptly and said, 'Excellent question! Come, and I will tell you the Perfect Dao. The essence of the Perfect Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, hold fast to the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary the body, do not agitate the essence—then you may attain long life. Let the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the mind know nothing, and the spirit will guard the body, and the body will attain long life. Guard your inner self, close off your outer senses; much knowledge brings ruin. I will lead you to the great brightness above, to the source of utmost yang; I will guide you into the gate of profound obscurity, to the source of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang have their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated myself for one thousand two hundred years, and my body has never declined.'\n\n\"The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, and said, 'Guangchengzi is truly heaven itself!'\n\n\"Guangchengzi said, 'Come, and I will tell you.

      "translated_text": "\"Those who attain my Dao shall ascend as emperors and descend as kings; those who lose my Dao shall rise as mere light and sink into dust. Now, all the myriad beings are born from earth and return to earth—thus I shall leave you, enter the Gate of the Boundless, and wander the Wilds of the Infinite.\n\nI share radiance with the sun and moon, I endure with heaven and earth—am I near? Am I far? All men shall perish, yet shall I alone endure?\"\n\nThis is the essential principle of Daoist life-nurturing, the mysterious pivot of longevity and enduring vision. The most crucial passage lies in the four characters *\"guard the One and abide in harmony\"*—the practice of mind and breath interdependent.\n\nThe study of the Golden Elixir traces its origins here. When the adept unites mind and breath, spirit and qi merge, yin and yang harmonize; in stillness, one enters profound obscurity—this is the *Kun* storehouse, the utmost yin. Yet once I return to pure *Kun*, the pure *Qian* within the void must respond and come, meeting in a fleeting encounter where timing and spirit converge. As the alchemical texts say: *\"After lead arises in gui, a single yang returns\"*—this is the utmost yang, the Great Brightness.\n\n*\"Yin and yang have their storehouses\"* refers to concealing mind and breath within the Mysterious Orifice. *\"Embrace spirit in stillness\"* means that as spirit and breath interdepend, one gradually enters quiescent concentration. *\"Dim and silent\"* describes the state of prolonged dependence entering into emptiness, the realm of primordial chaos.\n\n*\"Guard the One\"* means preserving this true primordial qi to congeal the Dao-embryo. *\"Abide in harmony\"* describes the equilibrium of water and fire, the perfect harmony of true qi, where the entire body becomes supple, blissful, and intoxicated.\n\nIn elixir practice, as I become empty and still, I attract the true qi of yang from *Qian*; through daily and monthly accumulation, it coagulates into the Elixir. Ultimately, the boundless primordial qi of heaven and earth nurtures both my physical and dharmic bodies. Over time, qi transforms, and the form becomes immortal.\n\nIn this state, there is no labor, no movement, no seeing, no hearing, no knowing—all are essential principles for nurturing spirit and settling breath. Only when spirit is settled does qi return; only when qi returns does the Elixir form. Thus, nurturing spirit is the first step in mysterious cultivation, the precursor to reversion.\n\nIf spirit is unsettled, the Dao cannot bear it. The terms *\"enter,\"* *\"lead,\"* *\"conceal,\"* and *\"guard\"* all reveal the subtleties of the firing process, which ultimately converge in *\"abiding in harmony.\"*\n\n*\"Enter the Gate of the Boundless\"* and *\"wander the Wilds of the Infinite\"*—uniting with the constant virtue of heaven and earth—depicts the image of Great Quiescence and True Emptiness. *\"Things will naturally flourish,\"* *\"that which is boundless,\"* and *\"that which is unfathomable\"* all point to the profound subtleties of the medicinal substances.\n\nThese three instances of *\"thing\"* refer to the *\"One\"* in *\"guard the One\"*—namely, the primordial true *yi* qi. Preserve it in stillness, gather it in movement; through long accumulation, body and mind both transform, form and spirit both become wondrous, and the Dao gathers within me. All men perish, yet I alone endure.\n\nThough brief, this wondrous passage encompasses the medicinal substances, firing process, true earth, gathering, and warming nurturance—all the principles of longevity and enduring vision. As Lu Xixing of the Ming Dynasty wrote in *The Nanhua Secondary Ink*: *\"Reading a thousand volumes of alchemical texts is not as good as studying a single passage from 'In the Realm of Yu.'\"* Truly, he was a connoisseur of the Dao.\n\nSome say Guangchengzi was an emanation of the Dao Ancestor. Yet this interpretation remains superficial. When the Yellow Emperor ascended Kongtong and met Guangcheng, it was the Yellow Emperor himself who had attained Great Quiescence and True Emptiness, thereby perceiving his own dharmic body. The dharmic nature is vast and boundless; the three realms of existence (the realm of proper vessels, the realm of sentient beings, and the realm of correct awakening) are established upon it—hence the name *Guangcheng* (Vast Completion).\n\nThis original self-nature is inherent in all, yet due to deluded thoughts, attachments, and defilements of discriminative views, one cannot realize it. If one attains emptiness of dharmas and exhausts the defilements of consciousness, the true suchness of dharmic nature will naturally manifest—luminous and all-pervading, like the sun emerging from behind clouds.\n\nThis is the esoteric meaning behind the Yellow Emperor’s ascent of Kongtong to meet Guangcheng. As *The Song of Realizing the Dao* by Yongjia says:\n*\"The mind-mirror shines, reflecting without obstruction,\nVast and clear, it illumines the ten directions.\nThe myriad forms and shadows appear within,\nA single orb of radiance, neither inside nor out.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang said: *\"The wondrous awakened radiance shines through inner and outer,\nEnveloping the six directions, without near or far.\"*\nMaster Miaozheng said: *\"Mind and Buddha are equal to emptiness,\nThe wonders within emptiness are unfathomable.\nThe azure sea’s light holds myriad rays,\nThe green mountains’ hues stand tall with a thousand peaks.\nCease groping, do not exert effort,\nFormless and imageless, all traces vanish.\nThe true suchness of wondrous form is originally formless,\nThe six penetrations and wisdom are not true penetrations.\nWhere dust arises, things manifest,\nWhere realms recede, minds become empty.\nRecognize the single pearl of mani,\nAnd the light of the Ganges’ sands shines eternally.\"*\n\nIs this not the dharmic image of Guangcheng?\n\nThus, the Daoist Guangchengzi is the Tathāgatagarbha of Buddhism, the true mark without marks and the wondrous mind of Nirvana in Chan, the One True Dharmadhātu of the Huayan school. Those who perceive it not only ascend as immortals and attain longevity (as the *Nirvana Sutra* calls *\"eternal abiding\"*), but as the Yellow Emperor, who met Guangcheng, naturally attained the Dao and became a perfected being.\n\nThe teachings of the Dao—caution within, closure without, guarding the One and abiding in harmony, preserving essence and nurturing spirit, merging form with the Dao—are the Yellow Emperor’s embodiment of the teaching, inaugurating the lineage of China’s mysterious tradition.\n\n*The Book of Liezi* records four passages of the Yellow Emperor’s teachings on the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The first passage states: *\"When form moves, it does not move—yet from it arises shadow. When sound moves, it does not move—yet from it arises echo. Without movement, nothing is born; from nothingness, being arises. Form must perish—do heaven and earth also perish? They perish with me.\"* The essential meaning here lies in the cycle of arising and ceasing, all rooted in movement. To reverse the flow of birth and death, one must attain non-movement. For movement departs from the root, while stillness returns to it. The phrase *\"Without movement, nothing is born\"* strikes to the very core. If a Dao practitioner reaches the state of a mind without movement, they transform arising-and-ceasing into quiescent extinction, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death is assured.\n\nThe second passage states: *\"The Valley Spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtly it endures, its use never exhausted.\"* This chapter secretly reveals the *\"outer Mysterious Pass.\"* The principle of mind and breath interdependent, neither forgotten nor forced, is the sole path of ascent in the Mystery School, the guiding principle for returning the breath to the origin. Master Hanxu said: *\"The Valley Spirit is the original nature. The valley symbolizes emptiness; the spirit, numinosity. When the nature-body is empty and numinous, it is not obscured. Not obscured means it does not die. Yet why is the Valley Spirit also called the Mysterious Female? The Mysterious is heaven; the Female, earth. When heaven and earth unite, the Mysterious Female is formed—within it, emptiness and vastness.\"* The sage in cultivating the body borrows this empty and vast Mysterious Female to nurture the empty and numinous Valley Spirit, hence naming the Mysterious Female after the Valley Spirit—this is the meaning of naming by function. Yin and yang course within it; Kan and Li unite within it. The harmony of heaven and earth is nothing beyond this. Thus it is also called the root of heaven and earth, meaning the root wherein heaven and earth mutually reside. The root of heaven and earth is the place of returning to the origin and reverting to the primordial, the realm of refining qi and transmuting spirit. *\"Subtly it endures\"* refers to nurturing the Valley Spirit, naturally attaining fetal breathing. *\"Its use never exhausted\"* refers to the external furnace’s waxing and waning, naturally aligning with the fire. *\"Never exhausted\"* means without labor. The formula states: *\"Concentrate the spirit in emptiness, follow the breath’s natural flow, abide in spontaneity, subtly it endures.\"* This is the marvel of *\"never exhausted.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Float and wander, guarding the center of the compass\"*—this is the same formula.\n\nThe third passage states: *\"When spirit and essence enter its gate, the bones and frame return to their root—what then remains of me?\"* This chapter reveals the dual stabilization of spirit and breath, the merging of being into non-being, the return to the fundamental root, the dissolution of both root and realm, and the attainment of the marvel of self-emptiness. As the *Lankavatara Sutra* says: *\"When the notion of a personal self is absent, one approaches this.\"* Yang Renshan said: *\"Ultimately, it reveals my true self.\"* The gate is the gateway of the Mysterious Female. The root is the root of heaven and earth. Like bubbles dissolving into the sea, if one seeks the form of the self, it is utterly unattainable. The culmination of this chapter lies in the phrase *\"what then remains of me?\"* Those who oppose the Dao are harmed by the grasping of self. The formula states: *\"Mind and breath interdependent, until external breath is entirely cut off, one abides in great serenity. With prolonged stabilization, one enters quiescence, forgets form and image, wondrously merges with true emptiness. Even if yang arises, it is as if unnoticed—this may be called 'what then remains of me?'\"*\"Enter\"* and *\"return\"* both reveal the marvel of reversing the flow to transcend birth and death. This *\"gateway of the Mysterious Female\"* was called by the ancients the *\"Gate of Life and Door of Death.\"* If spirit and essence exit its gate, one follows the flow and dies; if they enter its gate, one reverses the flow and lives. Exiting leads to dispersion, entering to gathering; exiting to annihilation, entering to preservation. Thus it is said: *\"The Door of Death and Gate of Life take this aperture as their foundation.\"* This chapter of the Yellow Emperor reveals the principle of *\"revolving the primordial and returning to the origin\"*—what the Old Master called *\"returning to the root and recovering the mandate.\"* The previous chapter revealed *\"regulating the breath and nurturing the spirit,\"* while this chapter reveals *\"form and spirit returning to emptiness\"* and entering the realm of the Great Void. The latter is deeper than the former, yet the practice is originally one continuous progression. If one can put these two chapters into practice, the path of return is already open.\n\nThe fourth passage concerns the Yellow Emperor’s spirit-journey to Huaxu. The *Liezi·Huangdi* states: *\"Thereupon, he set aside the myriad affairs, left his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells and chimes, reduced his meals, and retired to dwell in leisure in the Hall of the Great Court. Purifying his mind and disciplining his form, for three months he did not attend to government matters. One day, he lay down and dreamed of traveling to the land of Huaxu. The land of the Huaxu clan lay west of Yanzhou and north of Taizhou, countless thousands of miles beyond this state of Qi. It was a place beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot—accessible only by spirit-journey. In that land, there were no rulers or leaders—all was spontaneous.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Its people knew no cravings or desires—all was spontaneous. Unaware of delight in life, unaware of aversion to death, thus they knew no premature demise. Unaware of closeness to self, unaware of distance from things, thus they knew no love or hatred. Unaware of opposition, unaware of compliance, thus they knew no profit or harm. Entirely without attachment, entirely without fear or taboo, they entered water yet did not drown, entered fire yet felt no heat, endured blows without pain, suffered scratches without itch. Treading the void as though it were solid ground, resting in emptiness as though upon a bed, clouds and mist did not obstruct their sight, thunder and lightning did not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness did not unsettle their minds, mountains and valleys did not trip their steps—all was spirit-travel alone.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor awoke, he was joyful and content. Summoning Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan, he reported to them: “For three months I dwelt in leisure, purifying my mind and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao of nurturing the body and ordering things. Yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know: the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have attained it, yet cannot convey it to you.”\n\nThis passage, too, is allegory. The land of the Huaxu clan is the realm of the formless and soundless, the realm of great stillness. By relinquishing the myriad entanglements, forgetting both body and mind, stilling both emotion and perception, the Yellow Emperor suddenly awakened to the Dao of true constancy. This effortless operation is the most transcendent and free.\n\nThe saying “the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion” is an unchanging truth for all ages. Master Zao Bochang observed: “In the present, one is mortal; when emotion is forgotten, one becomes immortal.” Thus, forgetting emotion and stilling perception is the essential task in learning the Dao.\n\nAfter the Yellow Emperor, those who wrote books to elucidate Daoist teachings must first honor the Old Sage. The *Daodejing* begins with the two characters “being” and “non-being.” As it states: *“Abide in constant non-desire to observe its mysteries; abide in constant desire to observe its manifestations.”* These two lines, in terms of practice, describe the interdependence of mind and breath. What is called “the gate of all mysteries” is the Mysterious Pass. Where it says: *“Vague and indistinct, yet within it are images, within it are things, within it are essences, within it is sincerity,”* this refers to the gathering of primordial qi. Where it says: *“Can you embrace the One and not depart from it? Can you concentrate your qi and attain suppleness like a newborn babe? Can you open and close the Gate of Heaven without partiality?”* all point to the principles of regulating the breath. Where it says: *“Empty your mind, fill your belly,”* this is refining the self and laying the foundation. Where it speaks of “nourishing the Mother” and “guarding the Mother,” this refers to gathering and nurturing. Where it says: *“Guard the center and embrace the One,”* this is the long nurturing of the sacred embryo. Where it says: *“Attain emptiness and guard stillness, return to the root and recover life,”* this describes refining the form with jade liquid, the practice of self-cultivation that encompasses all. Where it says: *“A great state flows downstream”* or *“descend and take,”* this reveals the secret of the alchemical reversal of yin and yang, the union of heaven and earth. Where it says: *“Disregard the body,”* *“place the body last,”* this is the essential principle of guarding against danger. Where it says: *“Block the openings,”* *“shut the doors,”* this is the subtle truth of nurturing. Where it says: *“The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible; the empty qi brings harmony,”* this describes the circulation of qi through the celestial orbit. Where it says: *“Good conduct leaves no tracks,”* this describes the circulation of spirit through the celestial orbit. Where it says: *“Return to a state of no-thing,”* *“return to the limitless,”* this is the return to emptiness and union with the Dao.\n\nAlas! The profound meanings of the alchemical classics are fully revealed here.\n\nWhen Laozi was about to enter the Western Regions, Yin Xi encountered him at the pass and asked about the Dao. Laozi said: “Emptiness and indistinctness are the root of the Dao. It gives birth to me from the void, it leads me to non-being. Thus, what gives birth to me is spirit; what brings death to me is the heart. Therefore, the body is the chariot, the dwelling, the master. When the body is tranquil, spirit resides within it; when the body is restless, spirit departs from it. Thus, if one disregards the body and preserves spirit, essence and radiance remain. When virtue and Dao unite, one communicates with the Dao. The good person does not contend with the myriad things, is humble and without desire. Thus, desire is the root of misfortune and harm. Non-being is the origin of heaven and earth. The sage eliminates desire and enters non-being to assist the body. Therefore, when I look, I see nothing of desire; when I listen, I hear nothing of desire; when I speak, I say nothing of desire; when I eat, I taste nothing of desire. Serene and tranquil, thus I am clear and still, non-active, and qi naturally returns to its pre-birth state.\n\nI see that those who love others do not love as much as those who love their own bodies; those who love their own bodies do not love as much as those who love their spirit. Those who love their spirit do not love as much as those who relinquish their spirit; those who relinquish their spirit do not love as much as those who guard their bodies. Those who guard their bodies—this is constancy! Spirit gives birth to form; form completes spirit. Thus, if form does not obtain its spirit, it cannot live of itself; if spirit does not obtain its form, it cannot be completed of itself. When form and spirit unite, they mutually give birth, mutually harmonize and complete—only then is it achieved. The highest filial piety in the world may be called the ability to nurture one’s body. Those who can love their mother—thus their bodies endure long. When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Thus, those who skillfully nurture the body conceal themselves within the body yet do not emerge, conceal others within others yet do not appear. Why? They constantly take emptiness as the body, take non-being as the heart—this is called the body without body, the heart without heart. Thus, guarding spirit and attaining mysterious communication—this is called union with the Dao.”",

It was a place beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot—accessible only by spirit-journey. In that land, there were no rulers or leaders—all was spontaneous.\"*",

      "translated_text": "My life rests in myself alone, not in Heaven and Earth. If I do not see, do not hear, do not know, then spirit does not leave the body—thus it endures with the Dao. I share a single qi with Heaven and Earth, guarding my own root. Nothing in the world is more yielding than qi, nothing more yielding than the Dao. The Dao’s yielding nature encompasses Heaven and Earth, permeates the myriad things. For the soft can give birth to the hard, the weak can overcome the strong—yet none in the world know whence its root arises.\n\nBeing arises from non-being as its mother, non-being from emptiness as its mother, emptiness from the Dao as its mother—this is the root of the Dao. What is called a Daoist? One whose spirit, though within the body, ensures it never departs. Prosperity is born of decline, yin is born of yang, and so being and non-being give rise to one another, emptiness and fullness complete one another. Thus life returns to being, and non-being returns to non-being.\n\nMan exists within the Dao as a fish exists within water. When the Dao departs, man perishes; when the water dries, the fish dies. Therefore the sage returns to the state before birth—his form concealed, his spirit abiding—so the world turns to him. By non-action and non-affair, the state is full and the people prosper. Preserving the constancy of the Dao is called profound unity.\n\nMan is born by obtaining spirit, yet does not know where spirit resides. Only the sage conceals it within, so that the corporeal soul does not depart. Guard the mother, and the child is preserved—thus the people flourish. The Way of cultivating the body is to penetrate the primordial chaos of primal qi, to resolve and guard one’s own being.\n\nHeaven does not desire clarity, yet clarity returns to it; Earth does not desire turbidity, yet turbidity returns to it. Dampness does not desire water, yet water returns to it; dryness does not desire fire, yet fire returns to it. Emptiness and non-action do not desire the Dao, yet the Dao returns to them. From this we see: what nature of things is not spontaneous?\n\nWhen Laozi had finished expounding the Dao, he again addressed Master Yin: “I tell you the essentials of the supreme Dao: still the heart and guard the One—then all defilements vanish, and all affairs are complete.”\n\nThe subtlety of this teaching lies in concealing spirit and guarding the mother, in emptiness and spontaneity—this is the original teaching of the Daoist school. The opening phrase, “Vague and indistinct, it is the root of the Dao,” subtly instructs that the breath of spirit is settled in external emptiness, guiding it to return to oneness and enter samādhi. Thus the following text says: “It gives me life in emptiness, places me in non-being.” Again: “Exteriorize the spirit, preserve the spirit.” And again: “Though spirit is in the body, ensure it does not remain in the body”—is this not teaching one to “concentrate spirit in emptiness, empty body and heart”?\n\nThus, embracing spirit to nurture nature, and harmonizing with the mean to nurture qi, mother and child remain in mutual affection, nature and life unite—this is the essential Way of cultivating the body. To “nurture the mother,” “love the mother,” “guard the mother” is the teaching of “feeding the mother and guarding the mother” in the *Daodejing*. When body and heart are both settled, wondrously merging with true emptiness, one returns to the state before birth. When form unites with the Dao, concealment and manifestation are at ease—thus we know that emptiness and spontaneity are the fundamental principles of the Great Dao and the path to true attainment.\n\nThe text says: “When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Constantly take emptiness as the body, take non-being as the heart—this is called the body without body, the heart without heart.” And again: “Emptiness and non-action—yet the Dao returns to them.” What better transmission of the essentials of cultivating the profound mystery could there be? This truly may be called the subtle warp of the myriad wonders, the ultimate purport of the five thousand characters.\n\nThe secret formula says:\nSpirit and breath wondrously unite, returning to primordial chaos.\nGuard the center and embrace the One—body and heart are tranquil and still.\nEmpty, still, and serene—this is the dwelling of all sages.\nReturn to the state before birth, and the source of the Dao is seen.\nThe nature of emptiness, the original substance—beyond words and explanation.\nThe great compassion of sages and worthies reveals the essential principles.\nWhen body is empty and heart is still, the Dao naturally returns.\nConstant virtue does not depart, returning to the infinite.\n\n---\n\n**The Three Treasures of Laozi**\n\nThe Old Sage said: “I have three treasures, which I hold and preserve: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. Compassion makes one brave, frugality makes one expansive, not daring to be first in the world makes one the chief of vessels. Now, to abandon compassion yet seek bravery, abandon frugality yet seek expansiveness, abandon the rear yet seek the front—this is death.”\n\nLet us briefly elucidate their meanings:\n\n**Compassion** has two aspects:\nFirst, not harming or disturbing living beings. Thus one should uphold the four fundamental precepts: not killing, not stealing, not deceiving, not engaging in licentiousness.\nSecond, bringing joy to others. Thus one should skillfully benefit beings, aiding them according to conditions—whether through material gifts to provide clothing and food, or through Dharma teaching to nourish wisdom-life. Seeing all beings as one with oneself, one broadly practices skillful means and universally bestows the joy of Dharma. In this way, the wind of compassion and harmony daily increases, the wind of contention and plunder daily diminishes. Abandoning selfishness for merit and profit, exalting the substance of virtue and morality—thus the world may be pacified.\n\nThe Buddha is called “Great Compassion” and also “Great Hero,” for his virtue of compassionately delivering beings is all-pervasive.\n\n**Frugality** also has two aspects:\nFirst, living simply.\nSecond, reducing thoughts and desires. When inner and outer are mutually supported, essence and qi become abundant, and resources do not run dry—thus the people’s virtue may return to its origin.\n\n**Not daring to be first in the world** also has two aspects:\nFirst, to roam freely and nurture oneself, not hastening toward achievement—this is what is meant by “great vessels are late in completion,” the image of “sincere and substantial, radiant and luminous” in the *Great Accumulation* hexagram of the *Book of Changes*.",

      "original_text": "二者，谦抑下人，如主待宾，所谓“大国者下流”。 《大易·谦卦》：“谦谦君子，用涉大川”之象也。 老圣曰：“江海所以能为百谷王者，以善下之，故能为百谷王。 ”《易》曰：“谦亨，天道下济而光明，地道谦卑而上行； 天道亏盈而益谦，地道变盈而流谦，鬼神害盈而福谦，人道恶盈而好谦。 谦尊而光，卑不可逾，君子之终也。 ”此谦冲之德，孔老所同宗也。 慈为仁德，俭为净德。 不敢为天下先，则与世无争，与人无竞，与物无迕，乃虚中无我之德也。 仁慈之德，所以成人。 成人，即所以成己也。 俭约之德，所以修己也。 世人只知俭于财，而不知俭于心，俭于欲，积精气以自摄其生，斯岂老圣之所谓俭乎？ 谭子曰：“水火者，常用之物，用之不得其道，以致于败家，盖失于不简也。 饮馔者，常食之物，食之不得其道，以致于亡身，盖失于不节也。 欲救之求，莫过乎俭。 俭于听，可以养虚； 俭于视，可以养神； 俭于言，可以养气； 俭于私，可以养富； 俭于公，可以养贵； 俭于门闼，可以无盗贼； 俭于环卫，可以无叛乱； 俭于嫔嫱，可以养寿命； 俭于心，可以了生死。 是谓万物之化柄也。 奢者富不足，俭者贫有余。 奢者，心常贫； 俭者，心常富。 奢者，好亲人，所以过多； 俭者，能远人，所以寡过。 奢者事君，必有所辱； 俭者事君，必保其禄。 奢者多忧，俭者多喜。 奢者好动，俭者好静。 奢者好难，俭者好易。 奢者好繁，俭者好简。 奢者好逸乐，俭者好恬淡。 有毕生用一器而无缺者； 有十年而一裘不弊者，斯人也，可以即清静之道矣。 ”以上谭子俭化之说，正契老圣俭德之旨也。 老圣既举“大慈”为三宝之首。 又曰：“天将救之，以慈卫之。 ”又曰：“常善救人，常善救物，故无弃物。 ”然则玄宗学者，岂可事烹宰生物以恣口腹之欲乎？ 欲长生，当愿一切物类各得长生。 此方谓“平等大慈”，方为老氏之徒。 若捐物命，以益己命，大乖常善救物之训，即去慈远矣。 四、 老氏家法 老圣曰：“致虚极，守静笃。 ”又曰：“归根曰静，静曰复命。 ”又曰：“泊兮其未兆，澹兮其若海，旷兮其若谷。 ”又曰：“恬澹为上。 ”《庄子·天道篇》曰：“夫虚静恬澹寂寞无为者，天地之平而道德之至，故帝王圣人休焉。 ”又曰：“夫虚静恬澹寂寞无为者，万物之本也。 明此以南乡，尧之为君也； 明此以北乡，舜之为臣也。 以此处上，帝王天子之德也； 以此处下，玄圣素王之道也。 以此退居而闲游，江海山林之士服； 以此进为而抚世，则功大名显而天下一也。 ”",
      "translated_text": "Second, to humble oneself and yield to others, treating them as a host treats guests—this is what is meant by “the great state flows downward.” The *Book of Changes*’ *Hexagram of Humility* says: “The humble noble one, crossing the great river”—such is its image. The Old Sage said: “The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys because they excel in lowliness; thus they become kings of the hundred valleys.” The *Book of Changes* says: “Humility brings prosperity. The Dao of Heaven aids the lowly and illumines them; the Dao of Earth, though humble, ascends. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of Earth alters the full and flows toward the humble. Ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the human Dao detests the full and favors the humble. Humility is honored and radiant; its lowliness cannot be surpassed—this is the noble one’s ultimate attainment.” This virtue of humble emptiness is what Confucius and Laozi both revered.\n\nCompassion is the virtue of benevolence; frugality is the virtue of purity. Not daring to be first in the world means no contention with the age, no competition with others, no opposition to things—this is the virtue of emptiness and selflessness. The virtue of benevolent compassion is what perfects others; perfecting others is how one perfects oneself. The virtue of frugality and restraint is how one cultivates oneself.\n\nPeople today know only frugality with wealth but not frugality with the mind, frugality with desires—accumulating essence and qi to nurture life. How could this be what the Old Sage meant by frugality? Master Tan said: “Water and fire are things in constant use; if used improperly, they can ruin a household—this is due to lack of simplicity. Food and drink are things in constant consumption; if consumed improperly, they can destroy the body—this is due to lack of moderation. To remedy this, nothing surpasses frugality. Frugality in listening nurtures emptiness; frugality in seeing nurtures spirit; frugality in speech nurtures qi; frugality in private affairs nurtures wealth; frugality in public affairs nurtures nobility; frugality at the gate and courtyard prevents theft; frugality in defense and guards prevents rebellion; frugality with consorts and concubines nurtures longevity; frugality of the heart transcends life and death. This is the key to the transformation of the myriad things.\n\nThe extravagant, though rich, are never satisfied; the frugal, though poor, always have surplus. The extravagant are always poor in heart; the frugal are always rich in heart. The extravagant favor close associates, which leads to excess; the frugal keep their distance, which leads to few faults. The extravagant, when serving a lord, will surely be humiliated; the frugal, when serving a lord, will surely preserve their emolument. The extravagant are full of worries; the frugal are full of joy. The extravagant love action; the frugal love stillness. The extravagant love difficulty; the frugal love ease. The extravagant love complexity; the frugal love simplicity. The extravagant love indulgence; the frugal love tranquility. There are those who use one vessel their whole lives without it breaking; there are those who wear one fur coat for ten years without it wearing out. Such people can immediately attain the Dao of purity and stillness.”\n\nThe above are Master Tan’s teachings on the transformative power of frugality, which perfectly align with the Old Sage’s principle of frugal virtue. The Old Sage placed “Great Compassion” at the head of the Three Treasures. He also said: “When Heaven is about to save someone, it protects them with compassion.” And again: “Always excel in saving people, always excel in saving things—thus nothing is discarded.” How then could followers of the Mysterious Principle indulge in slaughtering living beings to satisfy their appetites? To seek long life, one must wish for all beings to attain long life. Only this is called “universal and equal great compassion,” and only thus can one be a true disciple of Laozi. To discard the lives of others to prolong one’s own life is a grave violation of the teaching to “always excel in saving things”—such a one has strayed far from compassion.\n\n**4. The Household Teachings of Laozi**\nThe Old Sage said: “Attain utmost emptiness, preserve profound stillness.” And again: “Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called recovering life.” And again: “Serene, without sign; tranquil, like the sea; vast, like a valley.” And again: “Tranquility is supreme.” The *Zhuangzi*’s “Heavenly Dao” chapter says: “Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus the emperors, kings, and sages rested in them.” And again: “Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action—these are the root of the myriad things. When Yao faced south and ruled as lord, he illuminated this; when Shun faced north and served as minister, he illuminated this. Those who dwell in this above become emperors, kings, and sons of Heaven in virtue; those who dwell in this below follow the Dao of the mysterious sages and uncrowned kings. Those who retire to this and wander in leisure are revered by recluses of rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; those who advance with this to govern the world achieve great deeds, renowned fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.”",

      "translated_text": "The eight characters—\"emptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, non-action\"—are the foundational principles of the Laozi school, the essence of profound learning, and may also extend to Confucianism and Buddhism. Truly, they are the universal path to entering the Dao and the guiding track for cultivating truth. All who study the teachings of Laozi and the lineages of the Literary and Alchemical traditions must adhere to them.\n\n\"Emptiness and stillness\" are the natural state of the original nature. Emptiness enables penetration; stillness brings clarity. \"Tranquility and silence\" eliminate desire, returning to simplicity and plainness. In solitude, one remains utterly alone; in non-action, the mind responds without contrivance, and the light of awareness becomes perfectly round. Thus, the Dao takes this as its root: \"In stillness, one becomes sagely; in action, one becomes kingly\"—all return to this. If scholars can achieve \"the interdependence of mind and breath,\" attaining great stillness and true stillness, they will resonate with this root and experience the self-realized realms of \"Heavenly Harmony\" and \"Heavenly Joy.\"\n\n**5. The Three Treasures of the Profound Tradition**\nThe Profound Tradition regards the ears, eyes, and mouth as the Outer Three Treasures, and original essence, original qi, and original spirit as the Inner Three Treasures. The Three Treasures of Laozi are the methods for establishing oneself in the world; the Three Treasures of the Profound Tradition are the essentials for refining and attaining truth.\n\nThus, the *Heart Seal Scripture* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" Combining these Three Treasures to form the elixir is called the Golden Elixir. Master Qianxu said: \"Original spirit is the spirit of primordial chaos, not the spirit of daily worries and thoughts; original qi is the qi at the dawn of creation, not the breath of mouth and nose; original essence is the most genuine essence, the essence that holds true constancy, not the essence of lustful indulgence. Only by obtaining and employing these three can one rescue the aged and infirm, replenish and extend life, return yang and transform the bones, and ascend to become a Heavenly Immortal of the highest grade.\"\n\nThe ears, eyes, and mouth are also called the Three Treasures because, in turning the light inward and reflecting, the value lies in self-perception; in the absence of sound and hearing, the value lies in self-listening. Beginners rely on these to observe and cultivate meditative concentration. The mouth, as the pivot of breath’s entry and exit, can emit sounds to expound the Dao and benefit beings, hence it is also called a treasure.\n\nIn the practice of the Profound Tradition, when inner and outer align, there are sayings such as \"mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture,\" \"the outer mouth attains the center, the inner mouth attains harmony.\" The deeper esoteric meaning is that the mouth is the cavern of emptiness, the image of true emptiness. The eyes are the opening of the mind’s eye, universally illuminating the ten directions—the image of \"great vision\" as described in the *Zhuangzi*. The ears are the awakening of the mind’s hearing, knowing all without obscurity. Thus, the precious ears, precious eyes, and precious mouth, pure and all-pervading, are boundless as empty space. There is no division between inner and outer, body and mind; the single true body fills the entire dharma realm.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Simple Explanations of Daoist Teachings* states: \"Begin by seeking in the initial stage, generally by calming the mind and reducing desires, first closing the Outer Three Treasures to nurture the Inner Three Treasures.\" It also says: \"Still the mind to nourish qi; quiet the mechanism to purify the mind. Essence, qi, and spirit are the Inner Three Treasures; ears, eyes, and mouth are the Outer Three Treasures. Always ensure the Inner Three Treasures do not wander after external things, and the Outer Three Treasures do not disturb the center. Let the breath be continuous and deep, entering the elixir field, making breath the husband and wife, spirit and qi the mother and child. When mother, child, husband, and wife gather without separation, the mind does not stray outward, thoughts do not wander, spirit does not roam, and essence does not move recklessly. Constantly steaming the four limbs, this is the orthodox path of the Golden Elixir.\"\n\nThe *Triple Concordance Scripture* states: \"The Three Treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be firmly sealed and not opened. The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass. Turning and curving to see and hear, opening and closing in unison, they become the pivot and axle of the self, moving and stilling without exhaustion.\" This illustrates the initial work of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath.\n\nThe oral instruction says: The Great Jiangxi lineage, in its transmission, begins by regulating the breath using the method of inward hearing. Inward hearing listens to one’s own breath; the mind and breath interdepend. Relying solely on the ear’s faculty is most fitting for this method—the *Zhuangzi*’s \"no sound, no hearing.\" If this is contemplated alongside the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s \"Guanyin’s perfect penetration through inward hearing of self-nature,\" it may be called \"two lutes in one hall\" or \"two mirrors in one case,\" embodying the sublime fusion of Chan and Daoist cultivation.\n\n**6. The Three Transformations of the Profound Tradition**\nThe Three Transformations of the Profound Tradition are: first, qi transformation; second, spirit transformation; and third, emptiness transformation. Unifying these three is called \"Dao transformation,\" just as the Tiantai school of Buddhism’s three contemplations—emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle—do not depart from the one mind.\n\nThe so-called qi transformation involves the interdependence of mind and breath, becoming increasingly harmonious and subtle until spirit and breath both settle. With my emptiness and stillness, I externally receive the primordial true qi of the pre-celestial One, which steams and nourishes the constructive and protective qi, circulating and irrigating without obstruction. As the ancients said: \"Constantly let qi penetrate the joints, and naturally essence will be full and the valley spirit preserved.\"\n\nThe *Triple Concordance Scripture* states: \"Cultivate without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain, gently like spring rain, fluidly like melting ice. Flowing from head to feet, it ultimately ascends again, coming and going through the boundless, suffusing the entire vessel. Reversion is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Weed out long-standing impurities, and the subtle is harmoniously regulated. The path of the turbid becoming clear is that prolonged darkness will eventually brighten.\" This is the efficacy of the Daoist practice of qi circulating through the microcosmic orbit—this is called \"qi transformation.\"\n\nThe second, spirit transformation, occurs after the initial stage of the Profound Tradition’s refining of essence into qi is complete. The essence gate is closed, and one regains the purity of youth. Thereafter, spirit and breath settle together in emptiness. When the primordial true yang arrives, it circulates once around the physical body, and because the spirit is settled externally, it immediately unites with my dharmakāya, becoming one.",

      "translated_text": "Shi Jianwu said: “Yang comes from the emptiness, embracing my master.” Because the spirit is settled and thus equally settled, the primordial spirit and primordial qi fuse into one furnace, forged into a single whole—Daoist texts call this the “Dao-embryo.” As the primordial spirit is nourished by primordial qi, it grows day by day, and the power of stillness deepens. When the ten-month gestation is complete, only the primordial spirit remains in serene illumination, unaware of qi, for qi has already dissolved. As suchness and serene illumination arise, the numinous light shines alone, the myriad forms merge in harmony, eating and sleeping cease, breath and pulse halt, and brightness endures day and night. Gradually one enters the immortal realm—this is the wondrous efficacy of “spirit transformation,” the efficacy of the spirit circulating through the macrocosmic orbit.\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*“Nine years of firing have passed in full,\nWhen suddenly the Heavenly Gate bursts at the crown.\nThe true person appears with great spiritual powers—\nFrom this moment, celestial immortals may offer their congratulations.”*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: “When the firing of the macrocosmic orbit is complete, one sheds the embryo and changes the bones, wholly transforming into a single golden light. The earth becomes a treasure, the body generates another body, and the yang spirit departs the physical form.” The Buddhist tradition calls this the “mind-generated body,” while Daoists term it the “spirit person.” The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *“Having roamed the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the lineage of awakening,”* and also: *“Having formed and shed the embryo, one becomes a true child of the Buddha.”* This expresses the same meaning—this is called “spirit transformation.”\n\nThird, “emptiness transformation”: In the Profound Tradition’s cultivation, from beginning to end, one never departs from emptiness, practicing entirely within the emptiness beyond the body. The initial return to emptiness (that is, refining the self) and the final return to emptiness (that is, attaining the Dao) proceed as one continuous process—hence it is called the “Profound Emptiness Great Dao.” Focusing now on the final return to emptiness: upon first obtaining the “mind-generated body,” like a newborn infant, it is still weak, so one re-enters profound samādhi. With my emptiness, I connect to the emptiness of heaven and earth; with the emptiness of heaven and earth, I connect to the emptiness of the dharmadhātu. As emptiness interpenetrates, one enters this great emptiness samādhi. After prolonged stillness, spirit and emptiness transform together. The six directions are all mind; the six directions are all body. Merging boundlessly, there is only one perfect illumination, all-pervading and all-containing. One can manifest limitless body forms and immeasurable spiritual powers, universally entering the infinite dharmadhātu, effortless and uncontrived—wherever the mind turns, it is accomplished. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* calls this: *“No arising of kinds and species, yet the mind-generated body is attained.”* Daoists call this the “perfected person”—this is the efficacy of “emptiness transformation.”\n\nMaster Lü said: *“The dharmakāya crumbles and fills the emptiness.”*\nMaster Zhang said: *“The emptiness crumbles to reveal the whole body.”*\nThe Seventh Patriarch of the Chan School, Venerable Basumitra, transmitted this verse:\n*“The mind is one with the emptiness realm,\nManifesting the Dharma equal to emptiness.\nWhen emptiness is realized,\nThere is no right, no wrong.”*\nThe Eighth Patriarch, Venerable Buddhadāna, transmitted this verse:\n*“Emptiness has no inside or outside,\nThe mind and Dharma are likewise.\nIf one understands emptiness,\nOne attains the truth of suchness.”*\nThe Buddhist tradition names this the “King of Emptiness” or the “Dharma King Who Shatters Existence.” When Daoists reach the ultimate return to emptiness, shattering emptiness itself, transcending the world without reliance—is this not the King of Emptiness?\n\nThe Northern School’s Li Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* most precisely expounds the purport of the Profound Tradition’s emptiness transformation—scholars should study it deeply and thoroughly.\n\n**Appendix: Li Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness***\n\nTo become immortal, Buddha, or Confucian sage,\nThe Three Teachings transmit but one emptiness.\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who transcend\nAll cultivate within emptiness.\n\nTo learn immortality, emptiness and stillness are the elixir’s essence;\nTo learn Buddhism, abiding in emptiness is Chan’s culmination.\nAs for my learning of the sagely way—what is it?\nIn emptiness, without self, the heavenly principle is illuminated.\n\nThe Dao-body’s emptiness is wondrous and inexhaustible,\nHeaven and earth’s emptiness operates with qi in harmonious fusion.\nYin and yang’s transformations are propelled by emptiness’s push—\nIf one abides in emptiness, all becomes malleable.\n\nThe marvel of the returned elixir lies in the valley of emptiness (that is, the emptiness beyond the body),\nBegin by attaining emptiness and steadfastly guarding stillness (the spirit is released externally, following the breath).\nWhen emptiness is utterly empty, primordial qi congeals;\nIn stillness upon stillness, yang returns.\n\nAn empty mind and full belly are the Dao’s foundation;\nWhen the numinous emptiness is not obscured, it is time to gather the medicine.\nResponding to conditions with an emptied self is true daily practice;\nOne with the great emptiness is a true man-child.\n\nGathering lead in emptiness and stillness is effortless action;\nAdvancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows and key.\nAll drawing and adding, increasing and decreasing, proceed from emptiness;\nShattering emptiness, one attains great awakening.\n\nUltimately, the Dao is quiescent yet functional—\nTo resolve entanglements and dull sharpness, both must be upheld.\nHarmonizing light and blending with the world, forgetting self and others,\nOnly the self knows what lies before the image of the Lord.\n\nBefore the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below—\nAt the center, a single point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\nEight-sided and flawless, without cracks.\n\nThe four edges are firmly sealed, the primordial chaos is refined—\nThis is the mysterious female gate of central emptiness (indicating the emptiness beyond the body, the so-called “outer mystery pass”).\nIf one employs emptiness within non-emptiness,\nNaturally, opening and closing respond to heaven and earth (mind and breath interdepend, released into the external emptiness, coming and going—this is the wondrous function of natural emptiness).\n\nWhen the mysterious female gate opens, the work reaches its peak;\nThe spirit exits and enters here (the breath is subtly regulated).\nExiting and entering, returning again to emptiness (mind and breath settle together, merging with the great emptiness),\nSuddenly, a spring thunderclap on level ground (stillness gives rise to movement).\n\nWhen the thunderclap resounds, heaven and earth open—\nFrom the emptiness, a wheel bursts forth.\nRound and full, vast and luminous,\nWithout lack or excess, it illuminates the bamboo studio.\n\nThe master of the bamboo studio is most extraordinary,\nCarefully applying it to timely matters.\nAbiding the spirit in emptiness, moving in emptiness (seven characters in one line, encapsulating the wondrous subtleties of the elixir method),\nUttering words to reveal the message of emptiness (out of compassion, there are written teachings to share).",

      "translated_text": "**Annotation:**\n\nMaster Hu possessed self-awakened sagely wisdom and the samādhi of self-reception. In the Mystery School, he may be called: \"the phoenix soaring through the clouds, unmatched across the ages.\" Only after this trial did Liezi’s heart submit, and he devoted himself single-mindedly to the Dao.\n\nLet us now explicate its meaning:\n\nFirst, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern. Earth is the surface. The grasses, trees, and forests are the patterns of Earth. They grow by day and lengthen by night, tranquil and still, showing no movement—this is the state of quiescence. The *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern is like the great Earth’s profound stillness; though treasures lie hidden within, they remain sealed and unrevealed. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: \"The divine wind is still, mountains and seas conceal the clouds. The heavens are free of drifting haze, the four *qi* bright and clear. The land of a kingdom—its mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all trace back to one origin, no longer high or low.\" This expresses the same idea: hidden and dense, with no mechanism to be seen. It is called \"the virtue of closure,\" where the spirit shaman sees only his seated corpse-like stillness, his breath deep and harmonious. They mistake him for damp ashes, declare him near death—this is merely glimpsing his traces while failing to know his root. In Buddhism, this *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern is called *śamatha*, the ultimate image of stillness. The phrase *\"Alas, he does not tremble!\"* most aptly describes this meditative realm. To tremble is to stir; here, there is no self-movement, nor self-cessation—like a mountain’s steadfastness, the utmost of stillness.\n\nSecond, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of Heaven-and-Earth, which exhibits a slightly more lively aspect than Earth’s Pattern. Liu Xusi said: \"Heaven-and-Earth refers to the space between heaven and earth, more manifest than Earth’s Pattern.\" Xuanjing said: \"Heaven-and-Earth is emptiness. Within emptiness, yet not empty, there flows a single *qi*, the mechanism of ceaseless generation. All things receive it and sprout—this is what is called *‘the good is in the incipient.’*\" The *dhyāna* of Earth’s Pattern transcends movement and stillness. Here, in Heaven-and-Earth, though name and reality are both forgotten, the mechanism arises from the heels. The spirit shaman perceives only \"the power of closure\" and a semblance of recovery, yet this is merely grasping its surface. The stillness of the perfected is profound and silent; their movement is the motion of heaven—both emerge from effortless response. How can one fixate on a single aspect and presume to discuss it? This *dhyāna* of Heaven-and-Earth is called *vipaśyanā* in Buddhism, meaning \"contemplation\" or wisdom. *Śamatha* is cessation, stillness, concentration.\n\nThird, Master Hu demonstrated \"the Great Thoroughfare without trace.\" \"Without trace\" means the utmost of emptiness and void, with no sign to be imitated. The *Zhuangzi* renders this as \"the Great Thoroughfare cannot be overcome,\" an error in transcription. \"Balancing the mechanism of *qi*\" is like water’s perfect stillness. As Caoshan said: \"Harmoniously without inner or outer, fused and level above and below.\" Xiang Xiu said: \"Abiding at the extreme of the Great Thoroughfare, the heart is limpid and anchored, mysteriously one with all realms, leaving no trace—this is the utmost of emptiness.\" Below, the nine depths are enumerated, yet the water’s nature—placid and unperturbed, profoundly silent—remains unchanged. This shows the perfected one’s effortless response to circumstances, entering the undifferentiated samādhi amid differentiated realms, and manifesting a differentiated form within the undifferentiated samādhi. Thus, the spirit shaman could not fathom him, dismissing it as \"inconsistent\"—his skill was exhausted. This *dhyāna* of the Great Thoroughfare without trace, the marvel of balancing the *qi*-mechanism, is the wondrous realm where mind and environment are thus, stillness and illumination simultaneous, yet both forgotten. In Buddhism, this is called *yuganaddha*, the \"wondrous contemplation of the Middle Way.\"\n\nFourth, Master Hu entered the *dhyāna* of \"never yet departed from my source.\" The source is the source of the mind. Every wondrous function arises from one’s own nature; the entire body appears and vanishes, its transformations boundless, yet never leaving the present thought. This is self-awakened sagely wisdom, the realm of self-awakening. Whether coughing, waving an arm, grasping a staff, raising a tablet, blinking, or raising an eyebrow—all are the supreme truth. Neither sage nor ordinary being can fathom it. This is precisely what the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* calls \"the Tathāgata’s *dhyāna*.\" \"Withered grass\" describes its boundless appearance; \"flowing wave\" depicts its following the current. At this point, the spirit shaman was at a loss. Beyond the reach of ear, eye, mind, or intention, he unwittingly lost himself and fled. This closely resembles the episode where Tang Dynasty Master Huizhong tested the \"mind-reading\" Great Ear Tripiṭaka (the master asked the monk thrice: \"Where is this old monk now?\" The monk could not answer, and the master rebuked him: \"You fox spirit! Where is your mind-reading now?\" The monk had no reply). Thereafter, Liezi returned home, forgot the distinction between self and other, and underwent rigorous refinement. Solitary and unmatched, he was able to realize and verify. *\"Thus he remained to the end\"* means: grasping the One, all affairs are complete. The sage embraces the One as the model for the world.\n\n**Eight. The Ten Virtues of the Mystery School**\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: \"The Ten Virtues first establish the foundation, together flying with the Seven Awakening Factors.\" It also says: \"The Eightfold Vision of the Grand Clarity proclaims the true script of the Ten Virtues.\" This refers to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mouth, and mind returning to their original state, the true nature perfectly fused. The eight consciousnesses do not arise; *qi* harmonizes and the Dao is established. Radiant and resplendent, the Ten Virtues are fully realized. The Ten Virtues: the number five pertains to earth; two earths combined form a jade tablet, hence the Ten Virtues—this is one explanation. The Mystery Teaching also has its own Ten Virtues: constancy, harmony, purity, clarity, subtlety, joy, simplicity, emptiness, and gentleness.",

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuangzi* states: \"Those who meet in the Dao do nothing yet attain stillness.\" It also says: \"Great stillness holds it.\" And again: \"An empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides where it rests.\" The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Great stillness preserves the true.\"\n\nIn the Mystery Teaching, when supreme stillness brings spiritual tranquility, the mind becomes profoundly serene, and all moving phenomena naturally cease to arise. Reaching the realm of immovability, birth-and-death are extinguished, and quiescent extinction manifests. Wondrously entering the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, one accords with the transformation of non-action and attains the inconceivable divine function. This is called the virtue of stillness.\n\nIn the Mystery Teaching, when the marvelous union of mind and breath occurs, spirit and *qi* harmonize and fuse, drawing celestial harmony through human harmony. Having attained the primordial, snow melts and ice dissolves, forming a single mass of supreme harmony. This *qi* circulates and fills, permeating and blending, dissolving all yin obstructions, and the Great Elixir naturally forms.\n\nThe ancient sages said: \"To know harmony is called constancy.\" The *Zhuangzi* states: \"Rising and falling, harmony is the measure.\" The *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* says: \"One *qi* harmonizes with supreme harmony; attaining the One, all is at peace.\" The *Scripture of Great Penetration* says: \"Attain stillness without movement; attain harmony without change.\" The *Scripture of the Heart Seal* says: \"Supreme harmony overflows, and bones scatter like cold jade.\" This is the cultivation of harmony, called the virtue of harmony.\n\nAs for purity, the Mystery Teaching fundamentally establishes its teachings on clarity, stillness, and unity. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Profound emptiness, clarity, and harmony—flowers penetrate and lead to mysterious brightness.\" Through the interdependence of mind and breath, the mind becomes still and undisturbed, the six senses are purified, and further, the six consciousnesses and six dusts are purified, extending even to the ten directions, the boundless realm of lands, all simultaneously purified. Entering this great gate of purity, one attains unhindered, free, and liberated existence.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"In the nine revolutions of the mirror, clarity arises; riding the light, one enters the fourfold brightness.\" The *Mysterious Accord* states: \"Profound subtlety is pure, and the sage’s ears commune with the divine. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are empty and bright. The profound emptiness is pure, and the mysterious breath connects with *qi*. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are empty and clear. The profound void is pure, and the numinous tongue flowers with communication. Without obstruction or hindrance, inner and outer are mysteriously bright. The profound truth is pure, and transformations respond naturally. The Dao pervades and endures, manifesting in all ten directions.\"\n\nThus, turning away from dust and returning to awakening, transforming defilement into purity, when the mind is pure, the land is pure—dependent and proper revolve in harmony. The true realm of quiescent light manifests effortlessly, called the Treasury of Pure Brightness. Through this, one benefits oneself and others, together escaping the sea of suffering and ascending the shore of the Dao, most surpassing and supreme. Therefore, this virtue of purity is most revered and exalted.\n\nAs for brightness, because the original body is pure, wisdom-light arises, illuminating the ten directions without obstruction. The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"Numinous light shines in eight directions, and the ten thousand spirits all arise.\" It also says: \"Flowing radiance of the six luminaries disperses distant obscurity.\" And again: \"Within the bright light of the profound, the true scripture of the Primordial One.\" And: \"The ten flower-like wondrous practices of the immortals subdue demons and generate the sixfold brightness.\" And: \"Profound vision perceives the unobstructed emptiness; the Primordial Beginning communicates its brightness. The dark pearl reveals its true form; inner and outer are clearly illuminated.\" And: \"The profound source and profound brightness—all myriad paths arise from their communication.\" And: \"The pure light of the profound source possesses its own efficacy.\" And: \"The profound and subtle is without obstruction, transforming the utmost of all hidden spirits.\" And: \"Stillness, harmony, wondrous brightness, and awakening—the mysterious breath naturally brings long life.\" And: \"The profound void manifests harmony and purity; flowers penetrate and lead to mysterious brightness.\"\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* says: \"When supreme stillness is secure, sagely wisdom is complete; when sagely wisdom is complete, wisdom-light arises; when wisdom-light arises, one becomes one with the Dao.\" The ancient sages said: \"To know constancy is called brightness.\" The *Zhuangzi* says: \"Nothing is better than to be bright.\" Thus, profound brightness and quiescent illumination are unobstructed and perfectly fused. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When brightness reaches its utmost, it is the Tathāgata.\" This is called the virtue of brightness.\n\nAs for the wondrous, emptiness and existence interpenetrate, the dependent and the proper intermingle, mind and realm become one, entering the source of equality at the boundary. The true nature is perfectly fused, unobstructed and all-pervading. The ancient sages called it \"the gate of all wonders.\" The *Scripture on Nourishing Life* says: \"Recognizing the non-emptiness of dharmas, perceiving without obstruction, one enters the gate of all wonders and naturally awakens.\"\n\nIn the initial practice of the scholar, when spirit and breath marvelously unite, body and mind harmonize and fuse, this is the preliminary step before entering the gate of all wonders. Thus, the wondrous virtue of the Mystery Teaching encompasses all dualities, perfectly fusing them into non-duality. Form and emptiness are without obstruction; body and mind intermingle, entering the Dharmadhātu of Samantabhadra, the layered realm of the imperial net. Truly, this is beyond what words, thoughts, or contrivance can reach. This is called the wondrous virtue.\n\nAs for constancy, the ancient sages called it \"constant virtue.\" The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* calls it \"eternal abiding.\" The ancient sages said: \"Constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of an infant; constant virtue does not err, returning to the ultimate.\" And: \"To be the valley of the world, constant virtue is sufficient.\" The *Scripture of Purity* says: \"The true and constant responds to phenomena; the true and constant attains its nature.\" And: \"The Dao of the true and constant is attained by those who awaken to it.\"\n\nThis true and constant nature is the source of the Dao. Those who accord with it attain the Dharma-nature body, eternally abiding and indestructible. Thus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls it: \"The eternally abiding true mind, the inherently pure bright essence.\" The ancient golden sages of great awakening all perfectly realized this mind, entering the ocean of the wondrously awakened fruit. The nature arises without action, universally manifesting the Dharmakāya.",

      "original_text": "涅盘四德，以常德居首，以此故也。 所谓乐者，乃自觉圣智善乐，亦称性寂天乐，亦称天乐。 《庄子》：“与人和者，谓之人乐； 与天和者，谓之天乐。 知天乐者，其生也天行，其死也物化。 静而与阴同德，动而与阳同波。 ”此天和、天乐，玄教所宗，洵属优生学之要素也，是谓乐德。 所谓素者，指本元自性，天真而妙，不属迷悟。 《庄子》曰：“纯素之道，唯神是守，守而勿失，与神为一，一之精通，合于天伦。 故素也者，谓其无所与杂也； 纯也者，谓其不亏其神也。 能体纯素，谓之真人。 ”见素抱朴，少思寡欲。 夫一切纷华，皆有生以后事，本源自性，清净恬淡，虚无寂寞，情识未起，更有于何欲习？ 故玄宗归真复朴，乃与道合真。 《庄子》曰：“一而不变，静之至矣； 无所于忤，虚之至也； 不与物交，淡之至也； 无所于逆，粹之至也。 ”是谓素德。 《大易》有“素履”之词，“白贲”之象，均契玄宗“见素养素”之道也。 所谓“虚”者，遗形忘体，恬然若无，是谓“身虚”。 绝念、忘知，三际皆空，情忘识泯，谓之“心虚”。 《庄子》曰：“唯道集虚。 ”又曰：“虚无恬澹，乃合天德。 ”又曰：“休则虚，虚则实，实则伦矣。 虚则静，静则动，动则得矣。 体以虚而运，心以虚而灵。 ”故老圣曰：“致虚极，守静笃”。 玄宗以“虚”为归，亦犹佛氏以“空”为归也。 是谓虚德。 所谓柔者，冲和一炁，细微泽润，熏蒸营卫，革故鼎新。 大周之后，真空炼形，以有返无，身亦炁化。 故老圣曰：“专气致柔，能如婴儿乎？ ”又曰：“天下之至柔，驰骋天下之至坚。 无有入无间。 ”“物壮则老，谓之不道，不道早已。 ”又曰：“人之生也柔弱，其死也坚强。 草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。 故坚强者，死之徒； 柔弱者，生之徒。 ”又曰：“天下柔弱，莫过于水，而攻坚强者，莫能胜之。 柔之胜刚，天下莫不知，莫能行。 ”又曰：“守柔曰强。 ”玄宗炁化，变刚为柔，乃出死入生之要素。 专气致柔，则其长生久视也必矣。 是为柔德。 以上十德，总而为一，则为玄德。 分而为十，各有优点。 十德圆成，道立矣。 九、 玄宗十通 《大洞经》曰：“洞源与洞明，万道由通生。 ”又曰：“洞明清净光，帝心大神通。 ”又曰：“十通由斯生，妙行由此兴。 ”又曰：“初曰通炁，次曰通神，终曰通灵。 万通成真，道备登宸。 ”《庄子》曰：“夫耳目内通，而外于心知，鬼神将来舍，而况人乎？ ”此神通之力，由禅定而发。 小乘诸仙，但得五通，即神境通、天眼通、天耳通、他心通、宿命通是也。 大乘诸仙，于此五通外，兼得漏尽通，共为六通。 若大乘大觉金仙，则得十通。 所谓十通者：一、善知他心智神通。 以得他心智通故，知其三千大千世界众生心无差别，如一世界。 乃至百千亿那由他世界，所有众生心，悉能分别了知。 二、无碍清净天眼智神通。 以得无碍清净天眼智神通故，所谓十方一切世界无量众生，死此生彼，善趣恶趣，福相罪相，悉皆明见。 三、宿住随念智神通。 以得宿住随念智神通故，过去不可说、不可说微尘数劫住宿之事，所谓某处生，如是名，如是姓，如是种族，饮食苦乐，从无始来，于诸有中，展转轮回受生，皆悉了知。",
      "translated_text": "The Four Virtues of Nirvāṇa place constant virtue at the forefront, precisely for this reason.\n\nAs for *bliss*, it is the joy of self-awakened sagely wisdom, also called the bliss of quiescent nature or celestial bliss. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Harmony with others is called human joy; harmony with Heaven is called celestial joy. Those who know celestial joy move with the course of Heaven in life and transform with things in death. At rest, they share the power of yin; in motion, they flow with the waves of yang.\" This celestial harmony and celestial joy are the principles revered by the Mystery Teachings, truly essential elements of the art of superior life—this is the virtue of bliss.\n\nAs for *purity*, it refers to the original essence of self-nature, wondrous and innate, beyond delusion or awakening. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The pure and unadorned Way guards only the spirit; guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. When the essence of oneness penetrates, it harmonizes with Heaven’s order. Thus, *purity* means having nothing mixed with it; *simplicity* means not diminishing the spirit. Those who embody purity and simplicity are called *true persons*.\" To see the plain and embrace the uncarved—thoughts are few, desires are scarce. All worldly splendor arises only after birth; the original source of self-nature is pure, tranquil, empty, and still, before emotions and consciousness stir—what desires or habits could there be? Thus, the Mystery Teachings return to truth and restore simplicity, merging with the Dao in reality. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Unchanging oneness is the ultimate stillness; nothing opposing it is the ultimate emptiness; no interaction with things is the ultimate blandness; nothing contrary to it is the ultimate purity.\" This is the virtue of purity. The *Book of Changes* speaks of \"plain treading\" and the image of \"white adornment,\" both aligning with the Mystery Teachings' path of \"seeing the plain and nurturing simplicity.\"\n\nAs for *emptiness*, to abandon form and forget the body, serene as if nothing exists—this is \"bodily emptiness.\" To sever thoughts, forget knowledge, empty the three temporal realms, dissolve emotions, and extinguish consciousness—this is \"mental emptiness.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Only the Dao abides in emptiness.\" And: \"Emptiness and tranquility accord with Heaven’s virtue.\" And: \"Rest leads to emptiness; emptiness leads to fullness; fullness leads to order. Emptiness leads to stillness; stillness leads to movement; movement leads to attainment. The body operates through emptiness; the mind is numinous through emptiness.\" Thus, the ancient sages said: \"Attain the ultimate emptiness; guard perfect stillness.\" The Mystery Teachings take \"emptiness\" as their return, just as the Buddhists take \"emptiness\" as their return—this is the virtue of emptiness.\n\nAs for *softness*, it is the harmonious and unified qi, subtle and moistening, steaming and nourishing the constructive and defensive energies, renewing the old and forging the new. After the great cycle, true emptiness refines the form, returning from being to non-being, and the body transforms into qi. Thus, the ancient sages said: \"Concentrate qi to attain softness—can you be like an infant?\" And: \"The softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest. The insubstantial enters where there is no gap.\" \"When things grow strong, they age—this is called not following the Dao; not following the Dao leads to early demise.\" And: \"In life, humans are soft and weak; in death, they are hard and stiff. Plants in life are soft and fragile; in death, they are withered and dry. Thus, the hard and strong belong to death; the soft and weak belong to life.\" And: \"Nothing under Heaven is softer than water, yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the hard. The victory of softness over hardness—none under Heaven do not know it, yet none can practice it.\" And: \"To guard softness is called strength.\" The Mystery Teachings transform qi, changing hardness into softness—this is the essential element for emerging from death and entering life. Concentrate qi to attain softness, and longevity and enduring vision are assured—this is the virtue of softness.\n\nThe above ten virtues, when unified, form *mysterious virtue*. When divided into ten, each has its excellence. When the ten virtues are perfected, the Dao is established.\n\n**Nine. The Ten Penetrations of the Mystery Teachings**\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* says: \"The Cavern Source and Cavern Illumination—from their union, the myriad Dao arise.\" And: \"Cavern Illumination is pure and luminous; the Emperor’s mind attains great spiritual penetration.\" And: \"The Ten Penetrations arise from this; wondrous practices flourish thereby.\" And: \"First is penetration of qi, then penetration of spirit, finally penetration of numinosity. When the myriad penetrations perfect reality, the Dao is complete, and one ascends to the celestial throne.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"When the ears and eyes inwardly penetrate and the mind’s knowledge is outwardly forgotten, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so humans?\" This power of spiritual penetration arises from meditative concentration.\n\nLesser Vehicle immortals attain only the Five Penetrations: divine power, celestial vision, celestial hearing, knowledge of others’ minds, and knowledge of past lives. Greater Vehicle immortals, beyond these Five Penetrations, also attain the penetration of the exhaustion of outflows, making Six Penetrations. As for the Great Vehicle and Great Awakening Golden Sages, they attain the Ten Penetrations. These are:\n\n1. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Knowing Others’ Minds**: With this penetration, one knows the minds of beings in a trichiliocosm without difference, as in a single world. Extending to hundreds of thousands of nayutas of worlds, one can discern and know the minds of all beings.\n\n2. **Penetration of the Unobstructed and Pure Celestial Eye Wisdom**: With this penetration, one clearly sees all beings in the ten directions—dying here and being born there, ascending to good realms or descending to evil realms, bearing marks of fortune or sin.\n\n3. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Recollecting Past Lives**: With this penetration, one knows the events of past lives spanning incalculable eons—where one was born, one’s name, clan, experiences of joy and suffering, and all the births and rebirths in the cycle of existence since beginningless time.",
      "overlap_context": "ttained by those who awaken to it.\"\n\nThis true and constant nature is the source of the Dao. Those who accord with it attain the Dharma-nature body, eternally abiding and indestructible. Thus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls it: \"The eternally abiding true mind, the inherently pure bright essence.\" The ancient golden sages of great awakening all perfectly realized this mind, entering the ocean of the wondrously awakened fruit. The nature arises without action, universally manifesting the Dharmakāya.",

      "translated_text": "4. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Knowing the Future Until Its End**: With this penetration, one knows all events in the future spanning incalculable eons—unfathomable as motes of dust in number.\n\n5. **Penetration of the Unobstructed and Pure Celestial Ear Wisdom**: With this penetration, one hears all sounds across every land in the ten directions, whether one wishes to hear them or not, freely and at will.\n\n6. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Non-Substantiality**: With this penetration, one can travel to all buddha-lands in the ten directions without moving from the original ground, benefiting sentient beings.\n\n7. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Discerning All Beings’ Speech**: With this penetration, one knows and distinguishes all the varied speech of beings in worlds as numerous as motes of dust in an ocean of buddha-lands.\n\n8. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Manifesting Limitless Color-Bodies**: With this penetration, one can manifest boundless, wondrous color-bodies to draw near those to be transformed, awaken them, and perform the work of liberating beings through various miraculous powers.\n\n9. **Penetration of the Wisdom of All Dharmas**: With this penetration, one skillfully expounds the unobstructed Dharma-gate, spreading Dharma-clouds and showering Dharma-rain, using wondrous sounds to reveal, instruct, awaken, and lead beings to attain pure liberation.\n\n10. **Penetration of the Wisdom of Entering the Cessation of All Dharmas**: With this penetration, one abides in samādhi’s true concentration while universally manifesting color-bodies, like light and shadow appearing everywhere, yet remaining unmoving in samādhi.\n\nThese ten penetrations are what the Great Awakened Golden Immortal realizes, called the *Dao-Penetration*, entering the ocean of perfect enlightenment—beyond the reach of lower stages.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Superiorities of the Mysterious Teaching**\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching possesses many superior qualities; to summarize its essence, there are ten:\n\n1. **Superiority of Health**\nMaster Zhou of the Song Confucians said: *\"Abundance and warmth are great wealth and honor; health and peace are priceless gold.\"* Yet while abundance and warmth are easily attained, the blessing of health and peace is not enjoyed by all. Even when obtained, it is fleeting—suddenly, old age arrives, vitality declines, and illness assails. The cultivator of the Mysterious Teaching differs: nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, body and mind remain robust, never decaying with age. By harnessing the primordial qi, refining the physical form, and transforming the mortal substance, the mortal substance is wholly transmuted, yin exhausted and yang purified. Thus, Chen Cuixu said:\n*\"Through the body shines golden light, the marrow fragrant,\nGolden sinews and jade bones—pure yang.\nRefining the red blood to flow as white,\nYin qi dissolves, the body naturally healthy.\"*\nThis is the first preeminent benefit in present enjoyment.\n\n2. **Superiority of Purity**\nThe Daoist teaching transforms through purity and stillness. The practitioner, through the interdependence of mind and breath, returns to the realm of the subtle and imperceptible, the state of great concentration. The celestial yang-qi of heaven and earth arrives unbidden, as it is said: *\"With my true emptiness, I resonate with that wondrous being.\"* The turbid is transmuted into pure yang, the mortal form refined into a numinous body. One feels worldly toils gradually recede, desires no longer intrude, no demons disturb, and the six senses become empty and still—body and mind at peace. *Zhuangzi* calls this *\"wandering in heaven,\"* while the *Scripture of Salvation* states: *\"The heavens are free of floating haze; the four qi shine clear and bright.\"* The mind-ground is likewise—this is the second superiority of purity and tranquility.\n\n3. **Superiority of Leisure**\nLeisure here means ease, not dissipation. Unaffected by honor or disgrace, unmoved by power or rank, one retreats from the world without melancholy, embracing the One in profound stillness. The mind is at ease, free of affairs; all burdens are cast aside. Joyful and content, serene and composed, one guides without leading, responds only after being moved. *Zhuangzi* said: *\"Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the equilibrium of heaven and earth, the perfection of the Dao—thus do emperors and sages rest in them.\"* The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *\"Observe the will, roam the spirit through the three numinous powers; at leisure, without care, the mind is at great peace.\"* And again: *\"With folded hands and non-action, the body is naturally at ease; when the body is empty of things, the mind is naturally free. Cultivating harmony, one abides alone in the true person’s palace, wandering in the garden of virtue, free from desires.\"* And: *\"Practicing the Dao in ease, dwelling alone, nurturing life and guarding emptiness—what thoughts or worries arise? With wings fully grown, one soars aloft, living long and gazing afar, then taking flight.\"* This is the wondrous leisure of body and mind in the Mysterious Teaching, akin to the ancient Chan masters’ *\"unlearned, non-active, leisurely Daoist.\"* Whether in the world or beyond it, this is the greatest enjoyment—this is the third superiority, that of leisure.\n\n4. **Superiority of Auspiciousness**\nThe Old Master practiced non-action, acting without attachment, accomplishing without abiding. Harmonizing with the world, blending light with dust, neither seeking nor rejecting, he remained still as empty space—thus, all his movements were auspicious. This is the virtue of non-contention, the wondrousness of non-attachment. Without intent toward self or other, without emotion toward coming or going, like flowing water or drifting clouds, without favor or aversion, one is carefree and at ease, transcendent and unburdened, following conditions with openness, following nature with freedom. *Zhuangzi* said: *\"Nothing is not forgotten; nothing is not present. In profound tranquility without limit, all beauties follow.\"* How auspicious is this! This is the fourth superiority, that of auspiciousness.\n\n5. **Superiority of Longevity**\nThe *Hongfan* chapter of the *Book of Documents* lists *\"five blessings,\"* with longevity among them. The *Book of Songs* sings of *\"brow-longevity\"* and praises *\"longevity like the Southern Mountains.\"* The cultivator of the Mysterious Teaching, having established the foundation of the elixir, gains mastery over life, roaming freely among grotto-heavens and blessed lands, laughing and wandering in the realms of the Ten Continents and Three Islands.",

      "translated_text": "Li Tuo’s eight hundred years and Anqi’s three thousand—such are the spans of the immortals. The Venerable Immortal of Broad Longevity of the Southern Culmen, born in high antiquity, had by the early Ming already reached ten thousand years of age, as clearly attested in the annals of the immortals. Thus Zhang Ziyang declared: *\"A single grain of the numinous elixir swallowed into the belly—only then do I know my life is not ruled by Heaven.\"* The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: *\"All men eat grain and the five flavors, but I alone consume the Great Harmony of yin and yang qi, and thus do not die, for Heaven’s favor is already mine.\"* It further says: *\"Seal the Gate of Life as if it were a jade capital—longevity will be transmitted for ten thousand years and more.\"* Chen Guanzhi observed: *\"This shore’s waves are left behind; only upon reaching that shore does one know longevity may be attained. Once gained, it should be forever kept—like a raft crossing the river or a ladder ascending to Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Daoist teaching of long life and enduring vision finds its superiority precisely in longevity. The celestial palaces of Lang Garden may be freely inhabited. Though mulberry fields turn to azure seas, one remains carefree and at ease—this is the fifth distinction, that of longevity.\n\n6. **Superiority of Other-Power**\nThe Three Primordials Elixir Methods of the Mysterious Teaching—Earth Primordial and Heaven Primordial—both pertain to the ingestion of external elixirs. With but a single *daogui* measure taken into the mouth, one sprouts feathered wings in broad daylight. Without passing through stages, one is instantly transformed from mortal to sage. The marvel of such divine transformation defies all thought. It can deliver deceased kin, restore desiccated bones to life—such inconceivable expedient methods belong to the Mysterious Teaching alone. This is its sixth distinction.\n\n7. **Superiority of Homestead Ascension**\nBy virtue of the surpassing efficacy of the divine elixir, one may cause an entire clan to ascend together, the whole household rising in flight. As with the Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang of the Jin, who ascended with his father’s clan, forty-two immortal kin, and six disciples, all at once—even the chickens and dogs followed in their flight. Such grandeur of *\"homestead ascension\"* is unique to the Mysterious Teaching, rarely seen in other traditions. This is the seventh distinction.\n\n8. **Superiority of Lineage Transmission**\nThe Daoist lineage of the Mysterious Teaching stretches far into the past, transmitted from master to master without interruption for thousands of years. The lamp of the Dharma has never been extinguished. Into the infinite future, its radiance will only grow brighter. All karmic encounters and circumstances are realized in the present—this is the eighth distinction.\n\n9. **Superiority of Transmission**\nBuddhist Dharma is divided into the True Dharma, Semblance Dharma, and Final Dharma ages. The ancient immortals of the Mysterious Teaching manifest in the world through the Dharmakāya, their bodily presence and speech guiding those with karmic affinity. For thousands of years, they have remained unchanged, as the Dao Ancestor has no day of *nirvāṇa*. The True Dharma abides in the world without temporal limit—this is the ninth distinction.\n\n10. **Superiority of Writings**\nBuddhist scriptures were all compiled by disciples from recollections. The Daoist scriptures of the Mysterious Teaching, however, were personally composed by the Dao Ancestor, spoken directly from his own mouth. To recite them is to hear his voice, as if seeing his person—this is the tenth distinction.\n\n11. **The Seven Greatnesses of the Mysterious Teaching**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Xu Wugui\"* chapter states: *\"To know the Great Oneness, the Great Yin, the Great Eye, the Great Equality, the Great Square, the Great Faith, and the Great Stability—this is perfection. The Great Oneness unites them; the Great Yin dissolves them; the Great Eye sees them; the Great Equality conditions them; the Great Square embodies them; the Great Faith verifies them; the Great Stability upholds them. They exhaust Heaven’s being, follow illumination, darkly possess the pivot, and begin with the other. Thus, to dissolve them is as if not dissolving; to know them is as if not knowing. Only after not knowing does one come to know.\"*\n\nThe commentary explains: The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s Seven Greatnesses reveal the wondrous Suchness of the Tathāgatagarbha, all-pervading and all-containing, manifesting the marvel of inherent virtue. The *Zhuangzi*’s Seven Greatnesses not only express inherent virtue but also cultivated virtue. Inherent and cultivated virtues are non-dual, encompassing both root and branch. The *\"Great Oneness unites them\"* already encompasses the *Śūraṅgama*’s Seven Greatnesses—earth, water, wind, fire, space, consciousness, and faculties.\n\n*\"The Great Stability upholds them\"* expresses cultivated virtue, aligning cultivation with inherent nature, so that karmic consciousness is forgotten and celestial truth appears. Wisdom illumines boundlessly, dark response is inexhaustible—this is what is meant by *\"exhausting Heaven’s being, following illumination, darkly possessing the pivot.\"*\n\nHere, *\"the Great Yin dissolves them\"* also expresses cultivated virtue. As the Old Sage said: *\"Returning to the root is called quiescence; quiescence is called recovering life; recovering life is called constancy.\"* The Great Yin is the virtue of stillness, the image of *kun*. The Great Eye is the universal eye. *\"The Great Eye sees them\"* expresses resultant virtue—the Dharma-eye, seeing through the Dharma-realm.\n\n*\"The Great Equality conditions them\"* expresses the virtue of transforming others—great equanimous compassion, universally covering all beings. *\"The Great Square embodies them\"* expresses inherent virtue—the interpenetration of body and realm, the image of principle and phenomena in perfect fusion.\n\n*\"The Great Faith verifies them\"* further expresses cultivated virtue. Faith is the source of the Dao, the mother of merit, the foremost of the myriad practices. Only with great faith can one realize great fruition; there has never been one who practiced without faith or realized without practice. Thus, these Seven Greatnesses encompass all causes, practices, and realizations without omission.\n\nThe final phrase, *\"Only after not knowing does one come to know,\"* perfectly accords with the *Prajñāpāramitā*’s *\"knowing nothing yet knowing all\"*—truly a meeting of Chan and the Mysterious. Lu Xixing’s *Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence* says: *\"These terms are all coined by Zhuangzi himself. The Great Oneness refers to the undifferentiated primordial state. The Great Yin refers to utmost stillness without response. The Great Eye is differentiated and named. The Great Equality means sameness without distinction.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Great Vastness is boundless yet unobstructed. The Great Faith contains within it the faith of faith itself. The Great Stillness is the stillness that stills all stillness—these are all what Heaven deems supreme, perfect, and utterly exhaustive, leaving no residue.\n\nIn relation to the Great Oneness, one *pervades* it. To pervade it is to abide in the state before the arising of the ten thousand things, where one may drift and float but cannot seek through thought or deliberation—hence it is called *pervading*.\n\nIn relation to the Great Yin, one *dissolves* into it. To dissolve is to be in the state of utmost stillness without response, where the mind may merge but cannot be grasped by names or forms—hence it is called *dissolving*.\n\nThe Great Eye may then accommodate our vision. The Great Equality may be followed in pursuit. The Great Vastness may be embraced in its entirety. The Great Faith may be examined for its timely movements. The Great Stillness may be grasped by its constancy. To know what Heaven deems supreme is thus.\n\nThis exposition of the Seven Greatnesses in *Zhuangzi* is subtly wondrous and perfectly harmonious. To know these Seven Greatnesses is true knowledge. If one fully comprehends them, one merges with the Dao in truth and attains transcendent freedom.\n\n---\n\n**XII. The Precepts of the Mysterious School**\n\nThe precepts of Daoism are scattered across various texts. Generally, precepts serve to restrain evil, collect the mind, and perfect the virtue of purity, tranquility, and unity. When the mind is single-mindedly devoted to the Dao, evil naturally vanishes; harmony arises, and all perverse qi dissipates. Thus it is said: *\"One of profound virtue is like a newborn babe—poisonous creatures do not sting, birds of prey do not strike, and tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons cause no harm.\"* This is called *\"the precepts shared by the Dao.\"* \"Shared\" means they are inherently possessed. Cultivating the Dao is the most excellent of virtuous practices; as the virtue of harmony is perfected, the precepts are naturally fulfilled. Thus, apart from the Dao, no separate precepts need be established—hence they are called *the precepts shared by the Dao*.\n\nThe formation of evil karma originates from evil intentions. If thoughts and distinctions are stilled, if one abides in utter quiescence, great stillness, profound non-action, and vast emptiness, then both good and evil are forgotten. If even thoughts do not arise, how can present karma be created? Thus, when the mind is settled in stillness, the virtue of precepts is perfectly realized. Apart from stillness, there are no precepts—this is called *\"the precepts shared by stillness.\"* *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Those who approach the Dao generate stillness without effort.\"* And again: *\"Gazing intently at his form, one sees only emptiness and void, seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing, grasping without obtaining. Radiant and luminous—who can attain this?\"* Behold how, in such stillness, the six senses become empty and silent, merging with the vastness of the Great Void—is this not the supreme manifestation of *\"the precepts shared by stillness\"*? These two are the precepts of the highest vehicle. With body and mind purified, the Dao is naturally perfected, and all precepts are perfectly fulfilled.\n\nNext are the *precepts of gathering wholesome dharmas*. The Venerable Laozi said: *\"Dwell in good earth, let the mind be good and profound, be good in companionship, good in speech, good in governance, good in action, and good in timing.\"* Master Qianxu wrote in *Profound Insight*: *\"The highest good adapts to circumstances without contention, neither shunning difficulty nor seeking ease—this is dwelling in good earth. Abiding in stillness without contention, neither clinging to tranquility nor rejecting disturbance—this is the mind’s goodness and profundity. Acting with impartiality, without contention between self and other—this is good companionship. Attaining subtlety in following the flow, without contention between expedience and reality—this is good speech. Nourishing the ten thousand things without contention between near and far—this is good governance. Good in action means being both rounded and square. Good in timing means acting or resting as the moment demands. These seven are all like water, benefiting all without contention. Only by not contending are self and other forgotten, inner and outer harmonized—whence could resentment arise?\"* These seven kinds of goodness gather the three karmas of body, speech, and mind; they govern interactions with others, self-cultivation, and transforming others, extending even to every movement and gesture, all of which are subsumed and directed toward supreme goodness. When the wind of kindness and harmony prevails, the evil karma of beings silently dissolves, and all return to purity, tranquility, and unity—the transformation of mysterious virtue. Hence, they are called *\"the precepts of gathering wholesome dharmas.\"*\n\nNext are the *precepts of observing discipline*. The Venerable Laozi said: *\"The ancients who were good as scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, and too deep to be known. Because they could not be known, I forcefully describe their appearance: hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter; cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides; dignified, as if guests; yielding, as if ice about to melt; simple, as if uncarved wood; open, as if a valley; merged, as if turbid.\"* These seven metaphors describe the demeanor of one who embraces the Dao. *Zhuangzi*’s praise of Daoist discipline goes even further: *\"Abiding like a corpse yet manifesting like a dragon, silent as an abyss yet resounding like thunder, spirit moves and Heaven follows.\"* And again: *\"The True Person of old did not oppose the few, did not dominate success, did not scheme for advantage. Such a one, when erring, felt no regret; when correct, remained self-content. Such a one, climbing heights without trembling, entering water without getting wet, entering fire without feeling heat—this is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao in this way. The True Person of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The True Person’s breath reaches the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat. The True Person of old did not delight in life, did not detest death, exited without joy, entered without resistance—coming and going with effortless ease. Such a one’s mind was steadfast, countenance serene, forehead broad and expansive.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "knowing does one come to know,\"* perfectly accords with the *Prajñāpāramitā*’s *\"knowing nothing yet knowing all\"*—truly a meeting of Chan and the Mysterious. Lu Xixing’s *Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence* says: *\"These terms are all coined by Zhuangzi himself. The Great Oneness refers to the undifferentiated primordial state. The Great Yin refers to utmost stillness without response. The Great Eye is differentiated and named. The Great Equality means sameness without distinction.\"*",

The Mysterious School’s Teaching on Transcending Life**\n\nThe Mysterious Teaching guides sentient beings with the character “life,”\nadvancing from “having life” to “longevity,”\nand from “longevity” to wondrous union with “non-life.”\n“Non-life” is that which was never born.\nSince it was never born, it does not perish—\ntranscending both birth and death,\nthis is the ultimate station of longevity.\n\nFor beginners, the work lies in refining the self and laying the foundation,\nemptying the heart and filling the belly,\nnurturing the original essence—\nthis is still within the station of life.\nWhen thoughts are extinguished in dual silence,\nand great serenity is attained,\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n“At this moment, the breath ceases like a small death,\nforged into oneness—this is perfection.”\nThus one turns from the station of life to the station of non-life.\nMaster Lü said:\n“Having been born, kill life;\nbefore death, learn death—\nthen there is longevity.”\nThis is precisely that station.\n\nAfter seven days, the Great Celestial Cycle is completed,\nreopening the primordial chaos,\nreestablishing the womb—\nthis is called “great death, great life.”\nFinally, returning to emptiness and completing the Dao,\nboth merit and station are transcended,\nthe void is pulverized—\nthis is the ultimate attainment of the Dao.\n\nThus the teaching of transcending life undergoes four transformations,\nthe meaning of which is expounded as follows:\n\n**(A) Life**\n*Explanation:* Guarding the One, dwelling in harmony,\nthe nature and life-force are wholly restored.\n*Verse:*\nSwallows dart in the sunlit day,\nyellow cranes cry in the evening breeze.\nThe old garden brims with spring’s depth—\npair by pair, they sport among the blossoms.\n\n**(B) Non-Life**\n*Explanation:* Thoughts extinguished in dual silence,\nreturning to the Ultimate Non-Being.\n*Verse:*\nThe six senses function yet no message comes,\nall at once entrusted to the spring wind.\nA wisp of incense smoke drifts in idle clarity—\nbirds do not come, yet flowers bloom red.\n\n**(C) Non-Life Giving Life**\n*Explanation:* Reopening the primordial chaos,\nreestablishing the womb.\n*Verse:*\nDeath yields life—this is no common thing,\nsecret workings reveal another excellence.\nAt midnight, a skull hums a tune,\nan icy river bursts into flame—yet remains cool.\n\n**(D) Neither Non-Life Nor Life**\n*Explanation:* The void is pulverized,\nutterly without trace.",

      "translated_text": "**Verse:**\nPrinciple and phenomena both forgotten—\nwho dares to measure this?\nPerfectly round, without seam or fissure,\nit pervades all realms yet never hides.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n\"When form is whole and essence restored,\none becomes one with Heaven.\nEmbrace it and it forms a body;\ndisperse it and it becomes the beginning.\nWhen form and essence remain unharmed,\nthis is called the power of transformation.\nEssence refined to the utmost,\nit returns to merge with Heaven.\"\n\nThis is the Daoist teaching of transcending life. Viewed through the four turning positions above, one perceives the marvel of the Daoists’ benefit to life.\n\n**XIV. Externalizing the Body and Transforming Form**\nThe Old Sage says:\n\"Place the self behind, and the self leads;\nexternalize the self, and the self endures.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n\"Transforming form into immortality,\nit sinks into silence without sound.\"\n\nHanshanzi says:\n\"To benefit is to refine one’s essence—\nthis may be called true benefit.\nTo transform is to alter one’s form—\nthis may be called true transformation.\nOne who can both benefit and transform\nshall ascend to the register of highest immortals.\nOne who neither benefits nor transforms\nshall never escape the calamity of death.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West says:\n\"Those who practice benefit and transformation\nconstantly contemplate the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure).\n*Numinous* is spirit;\n*Treasure* is essence.\"\n\nI note: The Dao of externalizing the body and transforming form is the direct pointing of the profound school’s cultivation and realization.\n*Externalizing the body* means illuminating the emptiness beyond the body—a single move. Like one who moves a jar must stand outside it to turn it freely, so too with the Dao of transforming form. One must first relinquish this corporeal body, enter the emptiness beyond, and there concentrate spirit and regulate breath. Only then can one generate being from non-being and exhaust the wonders of the seven returns and nine restorations.\n\nThus, in the profound school’s elixir method, one begins by working in the emptiness beyond the body and concludes in that same emptiness. From start to finish, step by step, one never departs from emptiness, operating entirely in the external realm—yet all effects manifest in the corporeal body. Such as transforming hair, teeth, blood, and pupils, or even transmuting the coarse physical body into a subtle dharma-body. The root and the world undergo secret revolutions and shifts, until the moment of womb-transcendence and spiritual transformation, when one soars aloft in ascension, attaining the freedom of spiritual powers.\n\nThus, one who can externalize the body can transform its form.\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\ndispersing like mist or wind and rain.\nSteaming and permeating the four limbs,\nthe complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.\nWhite hair turns black again,\nfallen teeth regrow in their original place.\nThe old man reverts to youth,\nthe aged woman becomes a maiden.\nTransforming form to escape worldly calamity,\nthis is called a *zhenren* (true person).\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"Nurturing essence and cultivating spirit,\ncommuning with the virtue of the Three Origins,\nessence overflows into the pores,\nsinews and bones become firm.\nAll evil is repelled,\nthe upright qi abides constantly.\nThrough long accumulation,\nform is transformed into immortality.\"\n\nThis is the proper path of the profound school’s cultivation, the efficacy of the union between Heaven and humanity.\n\n**XV. Dawn Clarity and Seeing the Unique**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Great and Venerable Teacher\" chapter says:\n\"Only after externalizing life can one attain *dawn clarity*;\nafter *dawn clarity*, one can *see the unique*;\nafter *seeing the unique*, one can transcend past and present;\nafter transcending past and present, one enters the realm of neither death nor life.\nThat which kills life does not die;\nthat which gives life does not live.\"\n\nThis is the profound school’s highest move.\n*Dawn clarity* means the five aggregates are utterly shattered, the nature of Heaven opens in clarity—like the first light of dawn, all yin is dispelled, and the myriad things are revealed. As the ancient worthies said: \"The solitary radiance of spirit shines, utterly detached from the roots of dust.\"\n\n*Seeing the unique* means penetrating the unborn and undying nature of dharma. All dharmas exist in duality, but this ocean of nature is one with everything, without duality—hence it is called *unique*.\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"seeing the unique,\" the *Liezi*’s \"doubting the unique,\" the Confucian school’s \"vigilance in solitude,\" and Chan Master Baizhang’s \"utterly alone and complete\"—all point to the essence of seeing nature. The three teachings converge here in their realization.\n\nOnly when the aggregate of consciousness is exhausted can one attain *dawn clarity* and *see the unique*, penetrating the nature of dharma to enter the realm of neither death nor life. Thus, the profound school’s thorough realization of the true and constant, its wondrous accord with non-birth, is no different from the Buddha’s \"Great Nirvana.\"\n\nLaozi’s \"seeing the plain,\" \"knowing the constant,\" and \"embracing the constant\" all reveal the wondrous essence of one’s original nature, identical to the *Zhuangzi*’s \"dawn clarity and seeing the unique.\" Yet commentators through the ages have failed to fully expound this, leaving Laozi’s teachings unable to harmonize with Buddhism and giving rise to disputes over superiority and inferiority—how lamentable!\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\"The elixir is the supreme treasure of the corporeal body,\nrefined to become inexhaustibly transformative.\nFurther, investigate the true source of nature,\nand decisively grasp the wondrous function of non-birth.\nNo need to wait for another life—\nbefore your eyes, attain the Buddha’s spiritual powers.\nEver since the Dragon Girl achieved this,\nwho since has followed in her footsteps?\"\n\nThis is what is called \"the wondrous Dao of the supreme and most true, the subtlest essence of the highest vehicle\"—the ultimate destination of the profound school’s path to enlightenment.\n\nViewed through the two chapters above, the Dao of externalizing the body and transforming form, the subtlety of *dawn clarity* and *seeing the unique*, perfect both life and nature, cultivate life while accord with non-birth, thoroughly penetrating above and below, encompassing sudden and gradual, universally benefiting all roots—this may be called the quintessence of Chinese civilization, a rare and divine marvel. All who aspire to the study of nature and life, to the methods of self-cultivation, should explore and delve deeply into this.\n\n**XVI. The Vast and Mysterious Dao**\nThe profound school’s cultivation and realization begin with emptiness. Within it, refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit—all are practiced in the emptiness beyond the body. Even when form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth, emptiness remains the Dao’s field. Thus, it is called \"the vast and mysterious Dao.\"",

      "translated_text": "Guangchengzi said: “I shall depart from you, entering the Gate of the Boundless, to wander the Wilds of the Infinite.”\n\nLaozi said: “The Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted.” He further stated: “What cannot be seen is called *yi*; what cannot be heard is called *xi*; what cannot be grasped is called *wei*. These three cannot be fathomed, thus they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim. Endless and unnameable, it returns to nothingness. This is called the formless form, the imageless image—this is *huanghu*. Meeting it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its tail. Grasp the ancient Dao to master present existence. To know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao.”\n\nThis chapter fully reveals the purport of the vast and mysterious. The “ancient beginning” is the nameless origin of heaven and earth, which is simply the One Emptiness. Phrases such as “cannot be seen,” “cannot be heard,” “cannot be grasped,” “cannot be fathomed,” “neither bright nor dim,” “unnameable,” “formless,” and “imageless” exhaustively depict the “one move of emptiness.” Thus, those who cling to the physical body and fix their efforts upon the upper, middle, and lower *dantian* entirely contradict Laozi’s principle of “vast mystery.”\n\nZhuangzi said: “Vacuity, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the ten thousand things.” He also said: “At rest, it is empty; empty, it is full; full, it is ordered. Empty, it is still; still, it moves; moving, it attains.” The commentary states: *Rest* means to lay everything down, leaving body and mind, inner and outer, utterly quiescent, reaching great samadhi. When emptiness is extreme, wondrous existence manifests. True emptiness is not empty—hence it is called *full*. An ancient master of the Chan school said: “To investigate the mind of the kingly Dharma, one must first exhaust emptiness, and only then can one accord with the non-empty virtue.” The meaning is the same.\n\nZhuangzi further said: “Vacuity and tranquility, non-action and blandness—these accord with the virtue of heaven.” The commentary states: *Vacuity* means to empty the mind; *non-being* means to void the body. When body and mind are empty and quiescent, movement and stillness are both forgotten, and the Dao naturally returns—hence it is said to “accord with the virtue of heaven.”\n\nZhuangzi also said: “Emerging without origin, entering without aperture, coming and going without visible form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is non-being. Yet within non-being there is non-non-being, and the sage conceals himself therein.” This is precisely the realm of “observing emptiness as empty, emptiness having no object of emptiness; when the object of emptiness is gone, even non-emptiness is empty; when non-emptiness is gone, there is only profound and constant stillness”—the ultimate of true vast mystery.\n\nMaster Lü said: “The whole world seeks wondrous apertures, but who in the empty vastness attains the true meaning?” Master Chongyang said: “To see true emptiness, the primordial void is the ancestral origin.” Master Yuyang said: “If in this life you wish to ascend the cloud path, you must unite with vacuity—without it, you cannot become immortal.” These ancient immortals admonish people with the essential principle of refining through vacuity.\n\nThus, Li Daochun said: “Cultivate the mind with vacuity, and the mind becomes still. Cultivate qi with vacuity, and qi becomes functional. Therefore, vacuity is the great root of all under heaven.” He further stated:\n\nTo become immortal, Buddha, or Confucian,\nThe three teachings transmit but one vacuity.\nFrom ancient times to now, those who transcend\nAll cultivate within vacuity.\nFor immortals, vacuity and stillness are the elixir’s essence;\nFor Buddhists, abiding in vacuity is Chan’s culmination.\nAs for me, how to learn the sage’s work?\nIn vacuity, without self, one illuminates heavenly principle.\nThe Dao-body’s vacuity is wondrous beyond measure;\nHeaven and earth revolve in vacuity, qi harmoniously fused.\nYin and yang’s transformations are vacuously impelled;\nIf one abides in vacuity, all becomes adaptable.\nThe wondrousness of the returning elixir lies in the valley of vacuity and non-being;\nBegin by attaining vacuity and steadfastly guarding stillness.\nVacuity upon vacuity, primordial qi congeals;\nStillness upon stillness, yang returns.\nAn empty mind and full belly are the Dao’s foundation;\nDo not obscure the numinous vacuity when gathering the medicine.\nEmptying the self to respond to the moment is true daily practice;\nOne with the great vacuity is a true man.\nGathering lead in vacuous stillness, acting through non-action;\nAdvancing fire with vacuity as the bellows.\nAll reduction and augmentation proceed from vacuity;\nShattering vacuity, one attains great awakening.\n\nHe also said:\nThe three and five merge into one, returning to vacuity;\nAfter returning to vacuity, even vacuity is gone.\nWhen non-non-being is also gone, profound stillness remains—\nThe Western barbarian is left beardless.\n\nNo writings on the Dao from ancient times to now have been as succinct and wondrous as these.\n\nThe secret formula states: Return the mind to vacuous quiescence, enter the body into non-action—its wondrousness lies in samadhi, and even more in forgetting. At the initial stage, begin outside the body, with mind and breath interdependent, causing spirit to congeal and breath to abide, merging with the great vacuity—this is the wondrous expedient for emptying body and mind, the orthodox gateway to entering the Dao under the pillar.\n\n**XVII. The Unattached True School**\n*Unattached* means having no abode, no clinging mind, forgetting things and forgetting cares, no self and no others. The purport of the unattached is expounded in Buddhism; here, we shall speak of it in terms of the profound school.\n\nLaozi said: “Profound and still, as if it exists; I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled.” He also said: “Sudden as the sea, drifting as if without place to rest.” This reveals the purport of the *unattached*—the wondrous practice of non-abiding.\n\nIn *Zhuangzi’s* “Free and Easy Wandering,” it is said: “The perfected person has no self; the spirit person has no merit; the sage has no name.” In *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, the text sets forth “transcending the world,” “transcending things,” and “transcending life,” all revealing the purport of forgetting emotions—the true meaning of the unattached.\n\nMaster Guanyin said: “The great self has no dwelling; forms and things naturally manifest. Its movement is like water; its stillness like a mirror; its response like an echo—thus its Dao is like things.”",

      "translated_text": "“This also reveals the mind’s non-abiding—thus its response to things is like the reflection in a mirror or the resonance of a bell, each perfectly corresponding to its measure. The wonder lies precisely in the two characters *wu ju* 無居 (‘non-dwelling’): *wu ju* means non-abiding in anything. Only when all attachment is absent can one wander freely beyond the myriad transformations, move in and out of the Three Realms, and attain unimpeded spontaneity.\n\nThe *Daodejing* repeatedly expounds the virtue of *bu shi* 不恃 (‘non-dependence’). As it says: ‘It gives birth but does not possess; it acts but does not depend; it accomplishes but does not dwell.’ ‘Supreme virtue does not act as virtue—therefore it has virtue. Inferior virtue does not lose virtue—therefore it has no virtue.’ It also says: ‘Heaven and earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs.’ The so-called ‘non-benevolence’ refers to non-dependence on benevolent virtue. All these perfectly express the purport of forgetting merit.\n\nThe unattached adept establishes neither the two extremes nor the middle way; they do not abide in birth-and-death yet move in and out of birth-and-death, do not abide in defilement and purity yet move in and out of defilement and purity—this is the highest transcendence. The Old Sage says: ‘They cannot be drawn near, nor kept at a distance; they cannot be benefited, nor harmed; they cannot be valued, nor debased—therefore they are honored by the world.’ This precisely reveals the wonder of non-attachment.\n\nFrom the perspective of the work of returning and restoration: when the mind and breath wondrously merge, and one reaches a state of melting softness and numbness, giving rise to various transformations of the *se-yin* (color-karma), the student must not cling to them in the slightest. To be without attachment is to be without danger. The ancients’ solemn warnings to guard against peril and consider risk were precisely to prevent one from being unable to relinquish the body and forget form.\n\n**18. Heaven and Humanity Emit Together**\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: ‘Heaven and humanity emit together; the myriad transformations establish their foundation.’ This is the transmission handed down in the Zhong-Lü lineage; what my late teacher imparted to me was likewise. For ten thousand generations to come, the practice of the Mysterious School will be no different. Thus these two lines truly constitute the esoteric purport passed down in an unbroken thread—the essential principle of the Three Passes in the cultivation of truth.\n\nOne asks: ‘What is *heaven and humanity emitting together*?’ The answer: ‘The firing process applied outside the body is the natural operation of *you-zuo-you-wei* (having action and intention).’\n\nOne asks: ‘What is *the myriad transformations establishing their foundation*?’ The answer: ‘All verifications appearing in the physical body are the natural operation of *wu-zuo-wu-wei* (having no action and no intention).’\n\nYet if one fails to awaken to the *one touch* outside the body, there is only humanity without heaven—thus it is difficult to realize the wonder of heaven and humanity emitting together. It is like a marionette on stage: only when the strings outside the body are manipulated in concert does the marionette’s bearing and movement become perfectly wondrous. The elixir method is the same: all firing processes occur in the empty space outside the body (that is, the *wai xuan guan*, the gate of total holding), while all transformations and all dharmic verifications manifest in the physical body. This is the essential wonder of dual cultivation of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life), and of heaven and humanity emitting together.\n\nIn the *General Explanation* of the *Three Teachings in One* by my late teacher, it is said: ‘In sum, the Great Way of the Golden Elixir—from the very beginning of refining the self and laying the foundation, through the stages of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally, the Greater and Lesser Celestial Cycles, each step, each procedure, each firing process, each transformation—all belong to the *one touch* in the empty space outside the body. If even a trace of intention clings to the postnatal physical body, it is “off by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form.” Once the *one touch* outside the body is complete, the physical body becomes that of a youth.

      "translated_text": "The *Yinfu Jing* states: “The cosmos lies within the hand, and the myriad transformations arise from the body.” If one can comprehend the *one touch* outside the body, then one understands that the cosmos lies within the hand. Having grasped that “the cosmos lies within the hand,” one naturally knows that “the myriad transformations arise from the body.” What is there to marvel at in this? One must recognize that dual cultivation is two matters, not one—hence it is also said: “Heaven and humanity unite in inception, and the myriad transformations establish their foundation.” Can these be distinguished?\n\nI say: The wondrous key to the union of heaven and humanity lies precisely in recognizing the *one touch* outside the body. *Journey to the West* calls this “Grandfather Sun” (a homophone for *gong* outside the body). The ancient sages termed it: “The nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.” Thus, if one begins at the “nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth,” then “one precedes heaven, and heaven does not oppose it”—how difficult could it be to transcend heaven and earth? By returning the yin and yang of one’s body (the heart and breath) to the emptiness of the void and reverting to the state before parents gave birth, the body and mind merge with the Great Void. The true yang within the Great Void comes unbidden; true water and true fire meet without expectation; the qi advances and retreats without deliberate movement. When the water and fire of *xing* and *ming* fuse, the numinous elixir forms without conscious effort—this is the subtle mechanism of grasping the essential, the secret wonder that accords with heaven and responds to humanity. How could mere fixation on the postnatal physical body, with visualization and circulation confined within, compare to this?\n\nThus, those who unite heaven and humanity operate within two layers of heaven and earth, four aspects of yin and yang, employing an inverted wondrous function beyond the ken of the common world.\n\n---\n\n**19. Non-Duality of Self and Other (I)**\nIn the esoteric tradition of cultivation, self and other are non-dual, form and emptiness are one. At its ultimate, form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. When first beginning, one must embody the *one touch* in the empty space outside the body, placing one’s heart and breath in mutual reliance beyond the self. With prolonged reliance, they naturally dissolve and unite with the void. When spirit and qi stabilize within the void, the physical body also naturally becomes empty. With inner and outer both empty, this resonance elicits that response, and the primordial qi of the prior heaven comes to the body, entering into mutual interpenetration. This is the wonder Lu Zu described as: “mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.” The primordial yang of the prior heaven embraces my Dharma-body and nourishes my physical body. Both form and Dharma are cultivated—*xing* and *ming* are dually refined. In this single moment of effort, one truly seizes a year’s worth of creation. Thus, the method of the true emptiness elixir differs entirely from other schools.\n\n**20. Non-Duality of Self and Other (II)**\nIn the poem *To Li Yuanyang*, Master Sanfeng wrote:\n*“The vastness of heaven and earth, three strums of the zither,\nThe harmony of breath, a single flute.\nTo cultivate transcendence within yin and yang,\nOne must cultivate beyond yin and yang.”*\nThis directly reveals that the mutual reliance of heart and breath must be placed in the empty space outside the body. Reliance is outside the body; stabilization is outside the body—only then does it accord with the wonder of “heaven and humanity uniting in inception.” The phrase “cultivating beyond yin and yang” subtly points to the “one touch in the empty space outside the body.” This is what the ancient sages called “the nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.” Alchemical texts dare not state it plainly, instead using terms like *that place*, *the other family*, or *that household* as substitutes. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: “Recognize the deathless method of the other family.” Qianxu’s *Jindan Jiuzheng Pian* states: “The essence of the prior heaven accumulates within me; the qi of the prior heaven is drawn from the other.” It also says: “I have examined ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, and all speak of the great medicine of longevity as formed from the true yi qi of the prior heaven. Where does this qi come from? They invariably say: from *that place*. Yet within our human body, is there truly no such qi, that we must seek it from *that place*? Those who believe are few, while those who doubt are many.” Alchemical texts are profoundly esoteric and difficult to read. Yet if one understands the “one touch in the empty space outside the body,” then all symbolic language can be effortlessly resolved.\n\nFor the Dao of the golden elixir is formed by the union of the absolute void and the relative yin and yang. The void is the mother of the elixir, the Supreme Ultimate; yin and yang are the heart and breath, spirit and qi, the Two Modes. When the three return to the one, reversing the flow, one becomes an immortal.\n\nMoreover, the void is the image of the prior-heaven Qian and Kun; the heart and breath are the image of the postnatal Kan and Li. By placing one’s heart and breath into the external void to rely upon it, and with prolonged reliance dissolving all distinctions—no going out, no coming in, no departure, no arrival—one returns from the Two Modes to the Supreme Ultimate. When body and mind merge with the void, they can function as the void, returning from the postnatal to the prior heaven. In other words, one’s small heaven and earth are immersed and fused within the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun, thereby seizing the creative power of heaven and earth and uniting the three realms within the body.\n\nFurthermore, the void is the other; the heart and breath are the self. By placing one’s heart and breath into the external void to merge, self and other become non-dual (uniting self and other into one body, one nation). The primordial qi of the prior heaven comes unbidden, arrives without seeking. Thus, the Dao of the golden elixir is entirely a matter of the void—beginning in the empty space outside the body, completing in the empty space outside the body. This is what the ancients called the “profound and mysterious great Dao.” Zhang Ziyang said: “The Dao of the returned elixir is most simple and easy—it is merely this ○.”",

Guest and Host in Mutual Illumination**\nLǚ Zu, whose Dharma name is Chúnyáng and style name Dòngbīn, takes the Dharma-body as host and the physical form as guest. To know this single point of the void is to be the master of Chúnyáng, whereupon the four great elements’ illusory composite body naturally retreats to the position of guest and is called “Guest Elder.” Thus, the *Wùzhēn* poem says: “Though he be host and I the guest.” Yet when the work reaches great samādhi, inner and outer become one, form and emptiness are unobstructed, and guest and host interpenetrate, self and other non-dual. Upon reaching this non-dual ground, one may enter the gate of all wonders. Zhāng Zǐqióng said: “Only when refining reaches the point where form and spirit merge in darkness does one know that form is none other than true emptiness.” When guest and host intermingle, one no longer calls it “Guest Elder” but “Returning Elder.” Herein lies the profound mechanism of Dharma concealed within Lǚ Zu’s name.\n\n**22.

When the two harmonize, the Mysterious Pass is established—its symbol being ○丨. Chén Xūbái’s *Guīzhōng Zhǐnán* depicts it thus, and the meaning is the same.

      "translated_text": "23. **Illuminating the Mysterious Pass**\n\nLǐ Qīng’ān’s *Zhōnghé Jí* states: “The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—the most profound and essential mechanism. It is not the glabella, nor the fontanelle, nor the navel, nor the bladder, nor the two kidneys, nor the space before the kidneys and behind the navel, nor the midpoint between the kidneys. From the crown of the head to the heels, throughout the four great elements of the body, if you fixate on any single location, you have already missed it. Yet you cannot abandon this body and seek it externally. Thus, the sages merely point to the character *zhōng* (‘center’) to guide others—this ‘center’ is precisely it.\n\nLet me offer an analogy to make this easier to grasp. Consider a marionette: its limbs move in a hundred ways, yet the puppet itself does not move—it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are the mechanism, it is the puppeteer who controls them. Ah! Do you recognize this puppeteer? Cease your doubts, for I shall tell you plainly: the puppet represents this body, the strings represent the Mysterious Pass, and the puppeteer represents the true master. The body’s limbs do not move of their own accord—it is the Mysterious Pass that moves them. Though the Mysterious Pass moves, it is the true master who commands it. If you recognize this moving mechanism, how can you fail to attain immortality?”\n\n**Explanation:** The marionette symbolizes our physical form. The pulling of its strings corresponds to the opening and closing of the breath through the mouth and nose. Yet one must not cling to the physical form, nor entirely detach from it. It is born of the primordial and connects to the postnatal, existing in the space a *cun* beyond the nostrils—where the breath rises and falls. The \"true master\" is *sūnwàigōng* (a pun on \"external work\"), represented by the symbol ○—the void beyond the body, a single point of emptiness.\n\nQīng’ān further states: “Most people mistakenly point to the navel wheel, the glabella, the space between the kidneys, or the area before the kidneys and behind the navel—all these are side doors. The alchemical texts say: ‘The Mysterious Pass is an aperture not found in the four directions, above or below, inside or outside, nor at the center. It is where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere.’”\n\n**Explanation:** The space a *cun* beyond the nostrils—is this not where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere? Within it lies the mechanism of opening and closing—is this not the Gate of the Mysterious Female? Thus, the Mysterious Pass is a single aperture of emptiness. Born of the primordial and connecting to the postnatal, when used in accord with nature, it makes one ordinary; when reversed, it makes one a sage. The gate of death becomes the gate of life, all rooted in this aperture. The initial practice of the Mysterious School—focusing the spirit and regulating the breath—begins here.\n\n---\n\n24. **Collected Explanations of the Mysterious Pass**\n\nThe Mysterious Pass is the gateway of heart and breath, hence called the “Gate of the Mysterious Female.” It is also known as the Ancestral Aperture, the Central Regulator, the Yellow Court, the Qi Cavity, the Spirit Chamber, the Earthen Cauldron, the Inner Courtyard, the Sea of Qi, the Return-to-Root Aperture, the Gate of Revival, the Gate of *Wù-Jǐ*, the Chamber of *Gēng-Xīn*, the Central Yellow Chamber, the True Unity Point, the Southwest Quarter, the Dragon-Tiger Cavern, the Yellow Dame’s Abode, the Altar of Guarding Unity, the Mansion of the Elixir Origin, the Golden Chamber, and many other names. All refer to the single point of emptiness beyond the body, where our life connects—where the breath rises and falls.\n\nMaster Zhōnglí said: “The gate of my birth, the door of my death,” and rightly so. This section shall extensively cite the sayings of various masters to confirm this, so that scholars may dispel all doubts and no longer mistake any part of the body for the Mysterious Pass.\n\nThe *Lièzǐ*’s “Heavenly Portents” chapter quotes the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: “The Valley Spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth. It endures ceaselessly, yet its use is inexhaustible.” This passage is also found in Laozi’s *Dàodéjīng*. Thus, the term “Mysterious Female” was first proclaimed by the Yellow Emperor, expounded by the Sage Laozi, and revered by alchemical texts through the ages—its origins are ancient.\n\n**Explanation:** *Xuán* represents Heaven, *pìn* represents Earth, and *mén* (gate) represents emptiness. Above is Heaven, below is Earth, and between them lies a void. Thus, the “Gate of the Mysterious Female” is the Valley of Emptiness. ○ symbolizes the single point of emptiness beyond the body, the center of Heaven and Earth, hence called the “root.” Here, one nurtures the Valley Spirit, regulates the breath to cultivate qi, and applies the fire phases—like the handle of the Dipper, without which the celestial revolution cannot turn. If scholars can unite heart and breath in the center of emptiness, without clinging to the slightest trace of the physical form—existing yet not existing, forgotten yet not forgotten—then, with prolonged practice, they will naturally become firmly bound, harmonious and seamless. This is the work of “enduring ceaselessly, yet its use is inexhaustible.”\n\nFrom ordinary breath, one transforms into true breath. At this stage, the scholar feels as if soaring through clouds and mist, with all eighty-four thousand pores of the body opening. The true yang of Heaven and Earth enters through the pores, suffusing the limbs and bones with indescribable softness and bliss. Thus it is said: “The postnatal breath stirs a gentle wind, awakening the true person’s breathing.” Yet those who do not begin with the “emptiness beyond the body” will never still their ordinary breath, nor attain the state of “returning to the root and reviving life,” nor realize the wonder of “Heaven and humanity united in action.”\n\nWhen spirit and breath settle in the emptiness, primordial qi nourishes the primordial spirit. The spirit, thus nourished by qi, is like a fish in water or flowers and trees bathed in rain and dew—ever more radiant, like a lamp fed with oil, its light growing ever brighter.",

      "translated_text": "Externally, the Valley Spirit; internally, the five viscera—all are steeped in the permeation of the singular qi. Nurtured thus day by day, cultivated and nourished, how could the Valley Spirit perish? Thus Purple Yang’s *Awakening to Reality* states: “To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root. Once true gold returns to the golden chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* elucidates the Mysterious Pass in several passages. The first declares: “Mysterious and again mysterious—gateway of the manifold wonders.” The Mysterious Pass is this aperture, the confluence of Heaven and Earth, the source from which all wonders arise; hence it is called “gateway of the manifold wonders.” Master Tan likewise names it “the gateway of vast qi,” its meaning being one and the same.\n\nThe second passage reads: “Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields. To speak much is to reach exhaustion—better to abide in the center.” In commentary: Heaven and Earth are likened to the Mysterious Female. Heaven is the Mysterious, Earth the Female; between them lies emptiness, void of substance, a circle ○ in form. Is this not the Mysterious Pass? The former phrase describes its essence, the latter its function. The bellows is the smith’s tool for fanning qi. Between Heaven and Earth, a single qi flows, its movement and stillness, expansion and contraction akin to a bellows—within the human, this is breath. Yet in ordinary people, mind and breath do not depend on one another; the bellows moves without restraint, unable to fulfill the subtlety of opening and closing. If one knows to guide qi with spirit, so that spirit and breath interdepend, respiration becoming ceaseless and fine, then the true breath, like a bellows, may summon celestial harmony, nurture life, cast off the mortal coil, and ascend to sagehood—is this not the wondrous function of the immortals? Thus it is said: “To speak much is to reach exhaustion—better to abide in the center.” The center is the Mysterious Pass. What does “abiding” entail? The spirit abides therein, meaning spirit and breath interdepend without parting. The Confucian “attaining central harmony,” the Buddhist “returning breath to the emptiness of space”—all refer to this same work. The Daoist tradition’s “center” points to the confluence of Heaven and Earth, hence the saying: “The confluence of Heaven and Earth is the true center.”\n\nThe third passage states: “As a thing, the Dao is elusive and evanescent. Elusive, evanescent—yet within it is something. Evanescent, elusive—yet within it is an image. Dim, obscure—yet within it is essence. Its essence is most real, within it is sincerity.” The fourfold repetition of “within” again refers to the Mysterious Pass. Elusiveness and obscurity are the signs of yin and yang in union. Once yin and yang unite, creation arises spontaneously—“an image, a thing, essence, sincerity.” At this, the Mysterious Pass within is fully revealed.\n\nThe fourth passage reads: “A great state lies downstream, the confluence of all under Heaven, the female of all under Heaven. The female ever overcomes the male through stillness, through stillness assuming the lower position.” In commentary: “A great state lies downstream” is a metaphor, meaning the male assumes the lower position, the spirit enters the qi cavern, descending to unite with the breath. “The confluence of all under Heaven” directly points to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. The female is the image of emptiness and stillness; through emptiness and softness, the breath unites with the spirit, cherishing and embracing it, unwilling to part. When spirit and breath harmonize, Heaven and Earth commune in peace, and the foundation of the elixir may be laid. Master Hanxu states: “This aperture lies at the center, hence it is called the confluence of all under Heaven. Within it is the Way of softness, hence it is called the female of all under Heaven. To speak of the female Way is to include the Mysterious Way. Thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is one Heaven, one Earth; one firm, one yielding. Without this, spirit and qi would remain robust yet antagonistic, ever at odds and ever apart. Therefore, the male descends to the female, the spirit descends to the qi, inverting their positions to unite, yin and yang coupling. Only then do spirit and qi meet, and the root is established.” This deeply accords with the passage’s profound meaning.\n\nThough the *Zhuangzi* does not mention the Mysterious Female, it speaks of “the pivot attaining the center of the ring, thereby entrusting the center to the nurturing of the ring.” These two instances of “center” are the same as the “abiding in the center” of the Old Sage. The “center” in the *Scripture of Salvation*’s “center regulates the five qi” likewise refers to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass. The phrase “center of the ring” is most apt, depicting the ring as endless. The center of the ring, being empty and void, is it not the image of the round emptiness ○?\n\nAfter the *Zhuangzi*, the most skillful in discoursing on the Mysterious Pass is surely Master Boyang’s *Kinship of the Three*. It states: “Square and round, a span in diameter, blending and constraining one another. Born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and exalted. Flanked by walls and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle.” This is a most exhaustive description. In commentary: “Square and round, a span in diameter” refers to the space a span beyond the nostrils, the locus of a compass’s sweep, where the movement of inhalation and exhalation resides. “Blending and constraining one another” means it is indistinct yet holds the mechanism of transformation; the prior and posterior heavens converge here. “Born before Heaven and Earth” clarifies that before Heaven and Earth existed, this aperture ○ already was. Thus it is evident that the Mysterious Pass cannot be sought in the physical body. For within the physical body, from crown to heel, all is of the posterior heaven. One must seek it at the inception of the nameless Heaven and Earth to attain it. “Majestic and exalted” extols its natural nobility, untouched by effort, unmarred by carving, incomparable to mundane things. The lines “flanked by walls and gates” and “resembling Penglai’s isle” borrow the celestial spirit-chamber for analogy—scholars must not cling rigidly to the image.\n\nThe *Kinship* further states: “When the upper is closed, it is called ‘being’; when the lower is closed, it is called ‘non-being.’”",
      "overlap_context": "o do not begin with the “emptiness beyond the body” will never still their ordinary breath, nor attain the state of “returning to the root and reviving life,” nor realize the wonder of “Heaven and humanity united in action.”\n\nWhen spirit and breath settle in the emptiness, primordial qi nourishes the primordial spirit. The spirit, thus nourished by qi, is like a fish in water or flowers and trees bathed in rain and dew—ever more radiant, like a lamp fed with oil, its light growing ever brighter.",

      "translated_text": "\"Non-being serves the above; above dwells the divine luminosity.\nThese two apertures follow a principle—even the golden qi mutually accords with them.\"\n\nZhu Yuanyu said: \"The two apertures are the wondrous openings of Kan and Li in their dual operation, what is called the Gate of the Mysterious Female—unknown to the world.\"\n\nI say: When spirit and qi wondrously unite at the Yellow Center, being and non-being intermingle, yin and yang merge, and return to the primordial beginning—this is the secret subtlety of the two apertures’ principle. As Master Zhou said: \"The true of the Wuji, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoin and coagulate.\"\n\nAfter Laozi, those adept at discoursing on the Mysterious Pass must rank Master Ziyang foremost. The *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: \"Within the body there is one aperture (not ‘within the body’ in the usual sense—take heed), called the Mysterious Female. It is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace. Whoever knows this one aperture finds the Winter Solstice therein, the medicinal substances therein, the firing times therein, the bathing therein, the embryo’s formation therein, and the shedding of the body therein. This one aperture has no boundaries, no inside or outside (all this subtly points to the emptiness of space—if sought within the body, how could it lack boundaries?), for it is the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness (the celestial mechanism laid bare in these four words). Thus it is sought ‘within the body’ (‘within’ is written with such subtlety: neither within the body nor apart from it, only ‘within’ will do), not to be sought elsewhere (clinging to self is false, grasping at other is deluded—only holding to the center comes near).\"\n\nThe *Four Hundred Words* says:\n\"This aperture is no ordinary aperture,\nFormed together by Qian and Kun.\nIt is named the Cavity of Spirit and Qi,\nWithin which lies the essence of Kan and Li.\"\n\nThe commentary explains: \"No ordinary aperture\" means it cannot be sought in the ordinary body—one must know it as an aperture without form or appearance. \"Formed together by Qian and Kun\" means above is Qian, below is Kun, and between them is an empty void, showing this aperture lies at the center of Qian and Kun. As Immortal Ge said: \"Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center, the center in emptiness, vast and open\"—just so. Master Luo Gongyuan said: \"One aperture in the emptiness of heaven and earth, intimate and secret, admitting no wind\"—this too is apt.\n\nBeyond the body lies Qian and Kun; within the body lies Kan and Li. Since it is said \"formed together by Qian and Kun,\" it is clearly formed prior to heaven and not within the body. It is named the Cavity of Spirit and Qi because here breath and heart depend on each other, and here spirit and qi return to their root. As Immortal Ge said: \"Gathered within the Dragon-Tiger aperture\"—just so. \"Within which lies the essence of Kan and Li\" means that upon attaining great stillness, \"medicinal substances arise in the Mysterious Aperture, and firing times emerge from the Yang Crucible.\" This refers to spirit and qi returning to their root: within emptiness, medicinal substances naturally arise. The Mysterious Aperture is the One, the spirit. The medicinal substances are the Two, the transformations. The wondrous workings of the Golden Elixir lie in Kan and Li. The wondrous workings of Kan and Li do not depart from the prior-heaven Taiji.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* says:\n\"The Gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known to the world;\nDo not mistakenly apply effort to mouth and nose.\nThough you may practice breath control for many years,\nHow can you grasp the Golden Crow and seize the Hare?\"\n\nThis again teaches that the Mysterious Pass cannot be sought by clinging to the physical body. If even mouth and nose are not the place, how much less the space between heart and kidney, between the eyebrows, or an inch and three fen below the navel? In sum, once you fix upon the physical body, you fall into the posterior heaven and are no longer in the Mysterious.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Mysterious Pass is the emptiness outside, why does Master Ziyang say \"seek it within the body\" rather than \"seek it outside the body\"?\n\nI answer: Though this aperture lies outside the body, it is intimately close to the mouth and nose. Within this compass, in a space of a square inch, where breath arises—poised between the physical body and emptiness—lies the body’s central axis, the place where spirit and qi return to their root, the junction of prior and posterior heaven. Hence it is called \"within the body.\" In truth, this aperture does not belong to the physical body, yet it is not entirely divorced from it. To cling to the physical body in seeking it is wrong, but to completely sever the connection is also wrong—the subtlety lies in neither approaching nor departing. Neither adhering to this body nor leaving it, outside the nostrils in the emptiness of space, where the breath moves in and out—like the strings that work a marionette, the master mechanism of the body’s movements—there lies the Mysterious Pass. To say \"seek it outside the body\" might lead deviant practitioners to transfer it onto a woman’s body and engage in all manner of perverse acts, such as the Three Peaks school’s sexual practices. The ancients did not shield themselves but spoke of the \"center.\" They also said: \"Where Qian and Kun unite.\"\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"The center is the great root of the world. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world. When center and harmony are realized, heaven and earth take their proper places, and the ten thousand things are nourished.\" Profound indeed! Profound indeed!",

In the final analysis, this aperture in the emptiness can give me life or take it away. Thus the ancients called it the “Gateway of Life and Death.” Elder Zhongli said: “The gate that gives me life is the door that takes it.” This refers to the Mysterious Pass. Ancestor Zhong further said: “To recognize the true locus of the Golden Elixir, work begins where the body has not yet been born.” Zhang Jinghe said: “If you see it before birth, you will surely become a Great Luo Immortal.” Yin Qinghe said: “To know the original true face, a bright wheel shines where the body has not yet been born.” All directly point to the “place of birth” as the single aperture in emptiness.\n\nThus our former teacher said: “If one attains the secret, then working within emptiness is the dual cultivation of essence and life. Apart from emptiness, there is no other path.” This reveals the celestial mechanism in full—something no ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts dare to speak.\n\nAfter Zhang Boduan, the most adept at discussing the Mysterious Pass is Chen Xubai’s *Guidelines for Centering Within*. In his “Diagram of the Mysterious Female,” he states: *“The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the center.”* He further says: *“The Mysterious Female is white as silk floss, continuous as a ring, twelve fen in breadth and length, containing the essence of the entire body.”* He cites *Awakening to Reality* as evidence.\n\nNote: Xubai’s diagram directly illustrates the principle of heart and breath interdependence. Two overlapping circles form a triad, showing heart and breath merging into emptiness. He also wrote *On the Mysterious Female*, saying:\n*“Within the body there is an aperture called the Mysterious Female.\nIt receives qi to give birth and is truly the palace of spirit.\nThe Three Origins gather here without distinction.\nEssence, spirit, hun, and po converge in this cavity—\nthe root of the Golden Elixir’s return,\nthe place where the immortal embryo congeals and the sacred fetus forms.\nThe ancients called it:\nthe stem of the Supreme Ultimate,\nthe handle of the prior heaven,\nthe lineage of the formless,\nthe root of chaos,\nthe valley of the great void,\nthe source of creation,\nthe aperture of returning to the root,\nthe pass of reviving life,\nthe chamber of the One Sovereign,\nthe numinous terrace,\nthe Crimson Palace—\nall refer to the same place.\nYet when sought within the body,\nit is neither mouth nor nose,\nneither heart nor kidney,\nneither liver nor lung,\nneither spleen nor stomach,\nneither the navel wheel nor the coccyx,\nneither the bladder nor the anus,\nneither the cavity between the two kidneys,\nnor the one inch and three fen below the navel,\nneither the Hall of Light (between the eyebrows) nor the Muddy Pellet,\nneither the Pass of Origin nor the Sea of Qi.\nSo where is it?\nThe wondrous secret is called ‘centering within’—\nwith undistracted intent, the immortal embryo is formed.\nAs the *Canticle* says: ‘The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the center.’\nThis is its meaning.\nLaozi said: ‘Much speech leads to exhaustion—better to guard the center.’\nIt lies below Qian, above Kun,\nwest of Zhen, east of Dui,\nin the realm where Kan and Li’s water and fire unite.\nAt the very center of the human body’s heaven and earth,\nwhere the eight vessels and nine apertures,\nthe meridians and collaterals converge,\na single aperture hangs suspended like a millet pearl in emptiness.\nIt does not stand by relying on form but exists by embodying the Dao.\nSeemingly present, seemingly absent,\nas if lost, as if preserved,\nwithout inside or outside,\nyet within it lies heaven and earth.\nThe Yellow Center penetrates principle,\nrightly positioned within the body.\nAs the *Book of Documents* says: ‘Only essence, only unity—truly hold fast to the center.’\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* says: ‘Centered in principle, the five qi merge; the hundred spirits are wholly preserved.’\nMaster Cui called it: ‘the passage that links the coccyx and the Muddy Pellet.’\nPure Yang called it: ‘exhaustively seek the place where the body first received qi.’\nZhang Boduan said: ‘I urge you to exhaustively seek the place of your birth.’\nIt is where the Upper Origin arises,\nwhere the true breath is established.\nThus Liu Yuchan also called it ‘the place where thoughts arise.’\nIf cultivators of the Elixir do not understand this aperture,\nthe true breath will not abide,\nand the foundation for spiritual transformation will be lacking.\nMoreover, this aperture is born of the prior heaven and connected to the posterior heaven.\nThe two qi of prior and posterior merge into chaos—\ndim and obscure,\nwithin it lies essence;\nflickering and indistinct,\nwithin it lies something.\nYet this something is no ordinary thing,\nthis essence is no ordinary essence.\nHeaven attains it to become clear,\nearth attains it to become tranquil,\nhumans attain it to become numinous.\nMaster Tan said:\n‘The gate of vast qi is how one returns to the root;\nknowing the bag of original spirit is how one conceals its light.\nLike a clam’s inner guard,\nlike a stone’s hidden treasure—\nthis is the chamber of pearls and jade.’\nAll are true principles.\nYet this aperture has no edges or boundaries,\nno inside or outside.\nIf one seeks it through form, appearance, or image,\none commits a grave error.\nThus it is said:\nDo not cling to non-action,\ndo not manifest in activity,\ndo not fixate on visualization,\ndo not attach to preservation.\nThe sages’ models appear in alchemical texts:\nsometimes called ‘a high rise in the mysterious center,\nshaped like Penglai,\nits gate subtly closed,\nwith spirit operating within’;\nsometimes called ‘shaped like a chicken’s egg,\nblack and white supporting each other,\none inch in breadth and length,\nthe beginning of the initial stage,\nenduring through ten months,\nthen breaking free from its womb.’”*",

      "translated_text": "The above passage by Chen Xubai expounding the Mysterious Pass originally comprised over fifteen hundred characters, of which only half are excerpted here, yet the essential purport is already clear. The text first enumerates the various names of the Mysterious Pass, then demonstrates that throughout the body—from the crown above to the coccyx below—none of these loci constitute the true Pass, thereby dispelling the error of externalists who cling to the physical form. Next, it introduces the term \"within the compass\" (*guizhong*), further elaborating the subtlety of the word \"within\" (*zhong*). It states: \"Below Qian and above Kun, east of Dui and west of Zhen\"—a painter’s technique of using clouds to set off the moon, employing the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) to highlight the central, empty position. It further declares: \"It does not rely on form to establish itself but is generated only by embodying the Dao.\" This again points to the empty position, for if it does not rely on form, it clearly does not reside within the body. The Dao is fundamentally empty; the Mysterious Pass embodies the Dao, and thus it, too, is undoubtedly empty. The concluding poem states: \"Tending the bud in emptiness and nothingness\"—directly indicating the empty position. \"One settles the original spirit within\"—showing the spirit congealed in emptiness, harmonizing with the breath. \"Breath comes and goes without interruption\"—demonstrating the interdependence of spirit and breath, refined to natural purity. \"The sacred embryo is perfected, returning to the primordial beginning\"—showing the embryo formed through the union of spirit and breath, with inner and outer both purified, its substance identical to emptiness, marking the moment of \"returning to the root and restoring the mandate.\"\n\nThe text extensively illustrates the symbolic forms of the Mysterious Pass, drawing material from the *Canticle of Unity*. It states: \"Without periphery, without inside or outside\"—citing the preface to the *Four Hundred Words* to subtly indicate the empty position. Xubai’s original text concludes with a detailed exposition on the principles of breath regulation, ending with: \"Yet this aperture, where yang expands and yin contracts, has no fixed form; it opens when intent arrives, and its opening and closing follow their own timing. After a hundred days, the foundation is laid, the qi-mother nurtured, and in the empty chamber, brightness arises—naturally perceived. The Yellow Emperor’s month-long inner contemplation followed this very method.\" This describes the Mysterious Pass of realization. The foregoing discussion pertains to the Mysterious Pass of faith. The Pass of faith relies on a teacher’s guidance; the Pass of realization must be personally verified, like one who drinks water and knows its warmth or coolness—no further instruction is needed.\n\nAfter Chen Xubai, those most adept at discoursing on the Mysterious Pass include Bai Ziqing, Li Qing’an, Zhang Sanfeng, and Li Hanxu. In Qing’an’s *Collection of Central Harmony*, the Mysterious Pass of the Life Cultivation school and that of the Nature Cultivation school are both expounded. The *Song of Nature and Principle* states:\n\"When the Two Modes first divided from the Supreme Ultimate,\nQian stands upright and firm, Kun opens and closes.\nBetween Heaven and Earth lies the Mysterious Female’s gate—\nthe more it moves, the more it emerges; the more it stills, the more it enters.\"\n\nThe *Song of Refining Emptiness* states:\n\"Before the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below.\nAt the center, a point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\neight-sided and flawless, without seam or fissure.\nThough its four boundaries are firmly sealed, it penetrates the undifferentiated—\nthis is the empty center, the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nIf within the non-empty you employ emptiness,\nnaturally it opens and closes in accord with Qian and Kun.\nWhen the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, the work reaches its apex;\nthe spirit exits and enters here.\nExiting and entering, it returns again to emptiness—\nlike a spring thunderclap from level ground.\"\n\nThe *Song of Embracing the One* states:\n\"The valley of emptiness and nothingness is inherently unobstructed;\nthe Mysterious Female’s gate opens and closes of itself.\nWhen the one yang returns, its wonder knows no end;\nthe Four Powers revolve Qian without cease.\"\n\nThe *Hymn to the Dao and Virtue* states:\n\"Opening and closing in accord with Qian and Kun—\nthis is the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nFrom non-being, it enters and exits,\nalone supreme in the Three Realms.\"\n\nAnother poem states:\n\"The valley spirit never dies—this is the Mysterious Female,\nthe very mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing.\nComing and going without cease,\npushing and surging without bound.\nThe white-haired Laozi rides a dragon away;\nthe blue-eyed foreigner mounts a tiger back.\nIf you ask where the work’s fruition is proven—\nthe light of the moon encircles heaven and earth.\"\n\nAnother verse states:\n\"The Mysterious Gate and Female Portal are not hard to know—\ngather body and mind and turn them inward.\nWhen you grasp the principle of the Two Modes’ pushing and surging,\nyou will understand the qi’s coming and going.\nQian and Kun open and close without rest;\nLi and Kan rise and sink, uniting and parting.\nI, Fuan, now make this clear:\nat the point where thought returns, the elixir’s foundation is laid.\"\n\nAnother verse states:\n\"The true and constant Dao is truly not difficult—\nit lies only in the everyday affairs of the present.\nWhen you know Qian and Kun’s opening and closing as one,\nthe two wheels of sun and moon naturally revolve.\nReturning to the root has its aperture for returning to the root;\nrestoring the mandate surely has its gate for restoring the mandate.\nOnce you tread through these two mechanisms,\ntranscending the mundane and surpassing the sacred becomes as effortless as idleness.\"\n\nThe *Song of the Original Dao* states:\n\"If the Mysterious Flow passes through the Mysterious Pass,\ntreading the luminous path to transcendence is truly not difficult.\nIt is merely the star’s tiny aperture—\nyet it deludes people as if separated by ten thousand mountains.\"\n\nThe *Living Methods of the Complete Realization* states:\n\"Refining qi lies in harmonizing and regulating—\nharmonizing the true breath, regulating the true origin.\nLaozi said: ‘The gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous, its use is never forced.’\nIs this not the essence of harmonizing and regulating?\nToday, people point to the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female’s gate—this is incorrect.\nThe Mysterious Female is the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing.\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states:\n‘Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian.\nOne closing and one opening is called change.’\nOne closing and one opening—this is one movement and one stillness,\nwhich is the meaning of Laozi’s ‘its use is never forced.’\"\n\nThe commentary states: The purport of Qing’an’s poems and songs is to guide one to comprehend the mechanism of breathing’s opening and closing in the emptiness beyond the body. Precisely here, mind and breath interdepend, until spirit and breath congeal and harmonize, the breath ceasing its ingress and egress. One becomes supreme in the Three Realms, nature stilled and emotions extinguished—transcending the mundane and surpassing the sacred.",

      "translated_text": "The study of returning to the root and restoring the mandate lies precisely here—this is the essential teaching of the *Gate of Mystery* in the school of destiny, the true lineage of the profound learning.\n\nLi Qing’an further stated: \"You need only apply effort in the twelve periods of the day and night, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, turning inward to seek. In silence, speech, sight, and hearing—what is this for you? When body and mind become still and settled, and the square inch of the heart is serene and clear, the true and wondrous mechanism will naturally reveal itself.\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: ‘Still and unmoving’—this is the essence of the *Gate of Mystery*; ‘stimulated, it penetrates all’—this is its function. If one takes a tangible, fixed location as the *Gate of Mystery*, no matter how diligent or painstaking the effort, the endeavor will ultimately fail. To point it out directly would risk your disbelief and render it unusable; you must see it for yourself.\"\n\nHe also said: \"The *Gate of Mystery* is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Today’s scholars often cling to the physical form—some say it is the *Cinnabar Field*, others claim the head has nine palaces with the central one as the *Gate of Mystery*; some point to the birth canal as the origin of life, or to the mouth and nose as the *Mysterious Female*—all are mistaken. Yet fixating on the physical form is equally wrong, nor should one seek it outside the body. Why do all the alchemical classics refrain from specifying its exact location? Because it defies description in words or writing, hence it is called the *Gate of Mystery*. Thus, the sages merely inscribed a single character, *zhong* (‘center’), to indicate it. This *zhong* clarifies the *Gate of Mystery*.\n\nThis *zhong* is not the center between inside and outside, nor the center among the four directions or above and below, nor even the center within a center. The Chan school says: ‘Neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil—at just such a moment, what is your original face?’ This is the *zhong* of Chan. The Confucians say: ‘Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called *zhong*’—this is the *zhong* of Confucianism. The Daoists say: ‘Where thoughts do not arise is called *zhong*’—this is the *zhong* of Daoism. These are the *zhong* employed by the Three Teachings.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: ‘Still and unmoving’—this is the essence of *zhong*; ‘stimulated, it penetrates all’—this is its function. Laozi said: ‘Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness; as the myriad things arise, I observe their return.’ The *Book of Changes* says: ‘In *Return*, the heart of Heaven and Earth is revealed.’ Moreover, in the hexagram *Return*, one yang emerges beneath five yin. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises—precisely in this movement lies the *Gate of Mystery*. You need only apply effort in the twelve periods of the day and night, wherever the mind stirs and thoughts arise, and the *Gate of Mystery* will naturally appear.\"\n\nThe above discusses the *Gate of Mystery* as the wondrous clarity of inherent nature, the thorough penetration of the school of self-nature, the supreme Dao of effortless wondrous awakening. Scholars must understand that nature and destiny are originally non-dual. Those who thoroughly realize the emptiness of the nature’s essence manifest their entire being across the ten directions; when nature is understood, destiny is encompassed within it—this is sudden awakening and sudden cultivation. For those who begin with regulating the breath and congealing the spirit, this is the gradual method. The *Gate of Mystery* in the gradual method pertains to the wondrous qi-mechanism of subtle existence, while the *Gate of Mystery* in the sudden method pertains to the nature-essence of true emptiness.\n\nUpon examining the original intent of the *Dao De Jing*, its statement that ‘the valley spirit does not die is the *Mysterious Female*’ also refers to the nature-essence of true emptiness. Master Sanfeng’s *Song of Sitting in Meditation* says:\n*\"At first, when sitting, learn to investigate Chan;\nThis message lies in the Gate of Mystery.\nSecretly and continuously regulate the breath,\nWithin the cauldron, one yin and one yang refine.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Secret Essentials of the Dao* says:\n*\"Observe the Gate of Mystery, regulate the true breath;\nKnowing these two essentials, cultivation is complete.\nWith the primordial spirit, enter the Sea of Qi;\nWhen spirit and qi merge in silence,\nYou attain the first mystery, the true sovereign.\nWith the primordial qi, enter the Yellow Court;\nWhen qi and spirit harmonize in profound stillness,\nYou attain the second mystery, most perfectly luminous.\nOne mystery is wondrous, one mystery is the aperture;\nWith desire, observe the aperture; without desire, observe the wondrous.\nThese two mysteries are the true mechanism,\nDifferent names arising from the same source—who knows?\nTo observe the Gate of Mystery, there is no other method;\nFirst, within the aperture, regulate the true breath.\nWhen spirit is tranquil and qi is still to the utmost,\nThe wondrous naturally emerges from non-arising, revealing the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe ancient immortals often spoke in half-words,\nFearing the leakage of true mechanisms, they did not speak recklessly.\nSome said it has a fixed location in the center,\nOthers said it has no fixed location and must be personally grasped.\nNow, I have spoken it all:\nIt lies between having a fixed location and having none.\nHaving a fixed location is called the aperture; having none is called the wondrous—\nWhat Laozi spoke of as ‘mysterious and again mysterious.’\"*\n\nThese two passages by the immortal master fully reveal the wondrous truth of the *Gate of Mystery* and breath regulation. His statement that \"it lies between having a fixed location and having none\" is the most perfectly rounded expression—none but an immortal master could have uttered it.\n\nA single touch of emptiness has no fixed direction—coming from the east, it is still emptiness; going to the west, it remains this emptiness. Since it has no fixed direction, it is without location. Yet before each person, just beyond the nostrils, within the space of a single breath, at the point where the in-breath and out-breath arise, each possesses a *Gate of Mystery*—this is the fixed aspect. Is this not \"mysterious and again mysterious\"?\n\nA verse says:\n*Having a fixed location yet none, neither identical nor separate.\nObserve the wondrous aperture equally, emptiness and existence both manifest.\nThough without form or appearance, it is not annihilation.\nSought, it cannot be seen; called, it responds.\nSeen, it has no form; heard, it has sound.\nThe treasury of the Tathāgata, the gate of all wonders.*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Poem on Seeking the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The Gate of Mystery is the key path in a single aperture,\nNeither heart nor kidney, most profoundly secluded.\nSearching the bladder or the valley passage is futile labor;\nDo not idly seek in the spleen, stomach, or Mud Pill Palace.\nThe root of spirit and qi is ever elusive,\nWithin the cavern of emptiness, explore carefully (this line reveals the entire mystery).\"*",

      "translated_text": "Originally, it resides solely in the luminous clarity,\nWhere the elixir is nurtured, one rides the crane in roaming flight.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Poem on Seeking the Gate of Mystery Again* says:\n*\"Like puppets on stage nodding in unison,\nKnow that all is pulled by unseen threads.\nThough pulled by another’s hand,\nWho commands when I am the one pulling?\nIt relies on the Lord’s constant moonlight;\nThus, everywhere becomes refined and free.\nIf you seek the Winter Solstice in elixir refinement,\nYou must seek it in the stillness of the numinous terrace.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *General Discourse on the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The body is Qian and Kun—seek not without.\nThe aperture of empty luminosity is most profoundly secluded.\nTwo or three may be permitted as companions,\nOne or four may likewise share the journey.\nThe Five Earths build the center to foster growth,\nWhere the Xun wind arises, firmness and softness are determined.\nOnce you recognize the wondrous return to the origin,\nWithin the Six-Six Palace, spring and autumn recur.\"*\n\nAccording to the immortal master’s poetic intent, one must depart from the physical form and seek this Gate of Mystery within the cavern of emptiness. *\"Where the Xun wind (wind as breath) arises, firmness and softness are determined\"*—this is precisely the location of the aperture of empty luminosity, the foundation of spirit and qi returning to their root, the wondrous key to reverting to the origin and restoring the primordial. After the body is broken, the original yang within gradually dissipates into the void. Thus, in the pursuit of reversion, one must also seek within the void to return things to their original master. This is why Master Sanfeng teaches to *\"explore carefully within the cavern of emptiness.\"*\n\nMoreover, the physical body is likened to a puppet. The outward and inward breath through the nostrils is compared to the pulling of puppet strings. The void outside the body is likened to the Lord who pulls the strings. This analogy is exceedingly apt (Note: Qing’an’s *Zhonghe Collection* contains this idea, which Master Sanfeng later expounded).\n\nIf I am pulled without awareness, it is because the mechanism of breath lies in another’s hands. Thus, if the mechanism of pulling is fixed, the puppet will collapse. Day and night, breath cannot be self-controlled. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, from old age to death, one never pays heed to this. Conversely, if one comprehends the mechanism of the Gate of Mystery’s opening and closing, then within the void outside the body, spirit guides qi, heart and breath interdepend, and through extreme reliance, they transform. Spirit and breath become settled, neither issuing nor entering, neither departing nor arriving. Thus, mastery lies within oneself, not another, and the root of life may be secured. Therefore, Ancestor Zhong said:\n\n*\"The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death,\nHow many are truly awake? How many truly realize?\nIn the still of night, the iron man reflects:\nLong life and immortality are made by man.\"*\n\nBai Ziqing’s *Secret of the Gate of Mystery* says:\n*\"The Gate of Mystery is the gateway to seeking the mysterious, the mechanism of the wondrous.

      "translated_text": "Returning to the root and reviving the mandate, bathing at the Gate of You is yet another barrier.\nGreat rest, great stillness—emptied and forgotten, returning to utmost quiescence—is yet another barrier.\nSuch are the essence and function of the Mysterious Barrier; all the thousands of scriptures and discourses are contained herein.”\n\nPurple Clarity’s *Discourse on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* summarizes the work thus: Taking the mutual dependence of heart and breath, reaching the state of utter stillness and unmoving tranquility as the foundation, one then arises from essence to function—when stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, at the moment when the solitary yang returns. When timing arrives and spirit knows, wondrous function appears before one. Swiftly rousing the wind of Xun to move the fire of Kun, one completes the entire celestial orbit and returns to great quiescence, giving rise to manifold transformations of firing times. Passing through this barrier and then another, the gates of barriers are layered upon layers. One must penetrate each and every one to reach the field of great rest. Speaking of the Mysterious Barrier’s progression, one may thereby glimpse the outline of firing-time transformations.\n\nIn Purple Clarity’s *Discourse on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, his master Chen Niyan states: “Simply abide in serene stillness, where thoughts contain no thoughts, and the work becomes pure, forged into one piece. Silent all day like a hen brooding her eggs, then spirit returns and qi is restored, and naturally the Mysterious Barrier’s aperture appears—vast beyond all bounds, minute within all interiors. This is the gathering of the primordial qi to serve as the mother of the golden elixir. Diligently practice this, and in a short time you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü.”\n\nThis teaching accords precisely with the moment when spirit and qi merge and the Mysterious Barrier appears. In sum, the wondrous union of heart and breath, forged into one piece, serves as the guiding principle for practice.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures: On the Mysterious Barrier’s Single Aperture* states: “The Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture arises from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. It does not reside within the five viscera, six bowels, or anywhere among the limbs and body. Speaking of its name, this barrier is a wondrous mechanism, hence called the Mysterious Barrier. This aperture is the place where the ten thousand methods return to one, solitary and without counterpart, hence called the single aperture. In a single phrase, it is called ‘the Center.’ The ‘Center’ lies in the midst of above and below, yet also does not lie in the midst of above and below, for it is both dead and alive. What is dead? Taking the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field as this Center is dead. What is alive? Concentrating spirit and gathering qi to reveal this Center is alive. Speaking in terms of the dead, it is called the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field. Speaking in terms of the living, it is called the Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture. Thus it is said: ‘Arising from the midst of emptiness and nothingness.’ The true mechanism is laid bare; those who attain it keep it secret.”\n\nCommentary: Master Hanxu’s opening two phrases in this discourse are most direct. Since it is said to “arise from the midst of emptiness and nothingness,” it is clearly not within the physical body. The subsequent text reiterates, “not residing within the five viscera, six bowels, four limbs, or hundred vessels.” Yet how laughable that scholars still grope for it within the physical body! “The place where the ten thousand methods return to one” is precisely the single point of emptiness—○—such is its image. It is also said, “solitary and without counterpart,” for emptiness does not belong to yin or yang, being absolute and not relative. This “concentrating spirit and gathering qi to reveal this Center” means forging heart and breath into one piece within emptiness.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Further Discourse on the Mysterious Barrier* states: “The Mysterious Barrier is the numinous radiance of spirit and qi’s union. When first glimpsed, it flickers without constancy. When first entered, it is indistinct and without basis, for spirit and qi have just merged and cannot yet coalesce firmly. Only when their embrace becomes pure and familiar, when the heart dies and does not stray, does one begin to recognize that within the Mysterious Barrier, self and other are forgotten, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it, and it is utterly undifferentiated, steadily soaring. Within this, wondrous transformations are manifold and beyond description. No wonder its names are so numerous. Each person’s perception differs, and each names it according to what they see, designating it by what they employ. Ancient immortals kept it secret and unspoken, requiring the transmission of precepts through the conferral of the master’s touch. Even when they did speak of it, they merely said: ‘It is neither heart nor kidneys.’ I say: It is also not the Yellow Court, qi cavern, or Cinnabar Field. Now I reveal it further; those who recognize it should keep it secret.”\n\nMoreover, *Direct Pointer to the Character ‘Center’* states: “What is the Center? It is the Mysterious Barrier. The *Triple Concordance* says: ‘In movement, do not lose the Center; in floating, guard the compass’s center.’ Both refer to this. The realm of the Center—from self-nourishment through concentrating spirit, entering the chamber to return the elixir, to the effortless transformation of spirit—all lie within it. Thus, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this Center to have a path of ascent. Formerly, Master Wen Shi asked the Most High: ‘What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the body?’ The Most High replied: ‘It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the Center and embracing the One.’ Further examining the *Concordance*, it says: ‘Closing above is called having; closing below is called lacking.’ I venture to say: These words ‘above’ and ‘below’ are both concealed within the character ‘Center.’ Yin and yang come and go within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between it. Uniting above and below, one enters into its midst. Thus, when above is closed and below is shut, the mechanism is subtle and tight. Within the great emptiness, the primordial qi moves alone, hence called ‘lacking’—this is also the purport of observing the wondrous. When below is closed and above is shut, it is hidden and unseen. Yet within the profound darkness there is essence, and within it there is sincerity, hence called ‘having’—this is also the purport of observing the aperture. Whether above is closed or below is closed, both return within the Mysterious Female. Whether without desire or with desire, all abide within the subtle and mysterious. Thus, the Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture is also called the wondrous aperture of having and lacking, the cauldron of above and below, the furnace of yin and yang, the cavern of spirit and qi—all derive from this, all are subsumed within the single Center.”",

Some speak from the position of faith, others from the position of realization; some expound from the perspective of the Life School, others from the Nature School. As the saying goes, ‘The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom’—it is difficult to generalize.\n\nAs for the poems of past patriarchs praising the ‘Mysterious Barrier,’ they are too numerous to recount. Here, a few dozen are cited to broaden understanding and illuminate the Dao’s subtlety. Personal reflections are also appended to elucidate the authors’ intent, making the meaning of the Mysterious Barrier even clearer.\n\nMaster Zhongli says:\n‘Three thousand six hundred gates of Daoist arts,\nEach gate clings to a single sprout of root.\nWho knows this trifling Mysterious Barrier’s aperture?\nIt lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates.’\n\nPure Yang Ancestor states:\n‘Mysterious Female, Mysterious Female—truly the Mysterious Female!\nNot in the heart, nor in the kidneys.\nSeek the moment of receiving qi at birth’s origin—\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is entirely revealed.’\n\nMaster Yuan’s intent is that all heterodox side paths busy themselves with the colored body. Only this Mysterious Aperture does not belong to form, yet remains not entirely separate from it—neither identical to this body nor apart from it. It is the junction of Prenatal and Postnatal, the pivot where Heaven and Humanity merge in simultaneous arising, unknown to ordinary heterodox paths.\n\nThe phrase ‘this trifling’ is most apt, referring to emptiness—what is called ‘so vast it has no exterior, so minute it has no interior.’ Lüzu’s verse directly instructs one to apprehend the state before birth, the moment of receiving qi, when originally there was nothing. As the *Cantong Qi* says: ‘Carefully consider the end, then contemplate the beginning. The body humans inherit is fundamentally nothingness.’\n\nThus, Lüzu also writes:\n‘The Great Dao abides before the Supreme Ultimate,\nExisting before father and mother gave birth.’\nAnd again:\n‘Few know the truth of my Great Dao—\nThe true Dao must be sought before birth.’\n\nZhang Jinghe says:\n‘The Primal Oneness’ single aperture is Prenatal,\nWithin it, emptiness and the principle of spontaneity.\nIf you perceive it before birth,\nYou will surely become a Great Luo Immortal.’\n\nThis ode is most wondrous, directly instructing one to apprehend the ‘face before birth.’ My late teacher’s *Three Teachings Unified* states: ‘In cultivating the Dao, one cannot depart from the state before birth. If you leave the state before birth, you cannot obtain the Prenatal true yang.’ It also says: ‘You must seek it before birth—only then is it Prenatal, only then is it dual cultivation. This is the crucial first step for those entering the gate.’ In sum, it cannot depart from the emptiness outside the body. If you can begin outside the body, the gate of the Mysterious Female opens, and the purport of dual cultivation is attained.’\n\nLiu Chuxuan says:\n‘The Mysterious Female’s gate is an aperture of emptiness,\nIts rhythm and timing must be constantly nurtured.\nWithin the immortal’s crucible, there is no other medicine—\nBase metals are refined into gold through a hundred smeltings.’\n\nZhao Yuandu says:\n‘The aperture of emptiness-nothingness stands at the center,\nWithout birth or extinction, it is inherently inexhaustible.\nLuminous and numinous, neither form nor non-form,\nVast and obscure, empty yet not empty.’\n\nMaster Ge the Immortal says:\n‘Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,\nThe center within emptiness is most vast.\nGather the Dragon and Tiger within this aperture,\nAnd the mechanism of creation returns to your grasp.’\n\nLuo Gongyuan says:\n‘An aperture of emptiness-nothingness within Heaven and Earth,\nIntimate and secret, impervious to wind.\nIn the indistinct and obscure, without color or image,\nThe true person appears within the precious pearl.’\n\nSima Ziwei says:\n‘The aperture of emptiness-nothingness is called the Mysterious Barrier,\nLocated within the human body’s Heaven and Earth.\nEighty-four thousand divisions above and below,\nNine, three, six, five arranged in cycles.\nVastly encompassing the Dharma-realm, without trace,\nMinute as a speck of dust, without appearance.\nThis is called the ancestral qi’s cavity,\nA grain of millet suspended at the center.’\n\nAll the above poems directly point to ‘emptiness’ as the Mysterious Barrier, their meaning quite evident. Sima Ziwei’s lines, ‘Vastly encompassing the Dharma-realm, minute as a speck of dust,’ are particularly masterful in depicting ‘emptiness.’\n\nTianlaizi says:\n‘The gate of the Mysterious Female remains open all day,\nWithin it, a single aperture blends with the numinous terrace.\nNo gate, no lock, no one to guard it—\nSun and moon, east and west, come and go of themselves.’\n\nChaoyuanzi says:\n‘The Central Peak stands tall, level with sun and moon,\nQian and Kun’s branches and leaves lie in the numinous stream.\nTortoise and Snake move back and forth like twin clouds,\nWind and rain drench a single plot of water.\nWithin the furnace, sovereign and minister are named Zi and Wu,\nWithin the crucible, husband and wife are called East and West.\nFortunately, the medicine of longevity remains here—\nWhy persist in deluding body and mind?’\n\nZhang Hongmeng says:\n‘The root of Heaven and Earth begins with the Mysterious Female,\nInhaling the sun, exhaling the moon, grasping the handle.\nHidden and manifest are both empty—empty yet not empty,\nSeek it and it cannot be seen, call it and it responds.’\n\nWang Chuyi says:\n‘The Valley Spirit establishes the root of Heaven here,\nThe highest sages name it the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nPiercing the worldly people’s life-and-death cavity,\nTrue immortals determine Qian and Kun at this point.’\n\nDing Yehe says:\n‘The Three Teachings’ unity is this perfect circle,\nBorn in non-action, prior to the Image of the Emperor.’”",
      "overlap_context": " called ‘having’—this is also the purport of observing the aperture. Whether above is closed or below is closed, both return within the Mysterious Female. Whether without desire or with desire, all abide within the subtle and mysterious. Thus, the Mysterious Barrier’s single aperture is also called the wondrous aperture of having and lacking, the cauldron of above and below, the furnace of yin and yang, the cavern of spirit and qi—all derive from this, all are subsumed within the single Center.”",

      "translated_text": "“When one awakens to this wondrous truth,\nOnly then does one know the ancestral root of the Great Dao.”\n\nMa Danyang says:\n“Laozi’s golden elixir, the Buddha’s pearl—\nPerfectly luminous, lacking nothing, with no excess.\nThe gate of death and door of life stem from this cavity,\nAnd this cavity alone can embrace the Great Void.”\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n“At the center of Heaven and Earth stands the Pass of Hangu,\nWhere sun and moon traverse from west to east.\nPeer through a tiny tube to glimpse the Mysterious Cavity—\nTiger crouched, dragon coiled, its qi majestic and grand.”\n\nXiao Liaozhen says:\n“Laozi clearly opened the gate of all wonders,\nWith each closing and opening responding to Qian and Kun.\nIn the formless realm beyond images,\nLies the root of eternal life without death.”\n\nHe also says:\n“Split open the Mysterious Female to reveal the twin passes,\nWhere refining work is no ordinary task.\nFor scholars seeking the true locus,\nFace the Northern Dipper while gazing south.”\n\nHe further says:\n“Within this tiny gourd lies another heaven,\nWhere an iron ox plows the earth to sow golden lotuses.\nSuch a scene exists in every household—\nWhy then do people of this age not cultivate immortality?”\n\nAnd again:\n“Though small as a gourd,\nIts upper and lower mirror Qian and Kun’s cosmic pattern.\nIf one knows the time and can apply it,\nThe golden crow and jade hare will move from west to east.”\n\nMaster Heshang says:\n“In profound obscurity, the gate of all wonders opens;\nIn fleeting glimpses, the true cavity is preserved.\nGathered, it hides within a single grain;\nReleased, it pervades the six directions.”\n\nGao Xiangxian says:\n“What is the Dao of True Unity?\nFirst, knock upon the gate of Wu and Ji.\nWithin the gate of Wu and Ji lies true water—\nThis true water is the root of the Yellow Sprout.”\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n“Bottomless, it is called the bellows; perforated, the key.\nWithin lies a single cavity—\nNo one has ever touched it.”\n\nShi Xinglin says:\n“One aperture, the Mysterious Pass,\nThe head of the three barriers’ path.\nWith sudden, effortless movement,\nDivine water flows naturally.”\n\nXue Daoguang says:\n“Mysterious indeed the true, female indeed the true—\nMysterious and female both converge in a single cavity,\nNot in mouth or nose, nor heart or kidneys.”\n\nMaster Lü says:\n“At midnight and noon, feast on the essence of sun and moon,\nOpening and closing the gate of the Mysterious Pass.\nEver thus, through life,\nHold fast to yin and yang, refining them with care.”\n\nLu Xixing says:\n“Do not dismiss the Mysterious Female as trivial—\nRecognize the door of life and gate of death.\nIf you grasp the mechanism and reverse the flow,\nYou will instantly transcend life and death, and the Dao will abide.”\n\nMaster Yin says:\n“Boundless and empty is the Mysterious Cavity—\nTo know yet not cling is the true work.”\n\nThe above verses and hymns by these venerable masters elucidate the principles of the Mysterious Pass, each profound in its own right, yet Master Yin’s two lines are the most direct and incisive. The first line defines its essence, revealing the emptiness beyond the body: since it is “boundless and empty,” all within the physical form—upper, middle, and lower elixir fields—being bounded, are not the true locus of the Mysterious Pass. The second line reveals its function: to concentrate the spirit in emptiness, to know the breath’s ebb and flow, to follow its natural course, and with a slight awareness, to let it be—this is the true work of “knowing yet not clinging.” Naturally, heart and breath harmonize; the breath, first short then long, then long then short, gradually becomes subtle and still, until it stands firm of its own accord. Like a leaf skiff, its moorings cut, drifting midstream—this is called entering samadhi, the true breath. All elixir methods are founded upon this. As *Zhuangzi* says: “The spirit born of instability cannot be borne by the Dao.”\n\nXue Daoguang’s poem reads:\n“A muddy snake dances in the well’s depths,\nWhile moonlight at the window illumines plum and pear.\nAt night, chaos shatters to the ground—\nThe ten thousand images vanish without trace.”\n\nChen Chongsu says:\n“At this moment, body and heart merge,\nEqual to the emptiness of space.\nOne no longer knows the body as self, nor self as body,\nNor spirit as qi, nor qi as spirit.\nSuch transformation is not through visualization or effort,\nBut arises naturally, without knowing how.”\n\nI say: This is the essential first step in refining the self and laying the foundation.\n\n---\n\nTwenty-Five: The Inner and Outer Mysterious Passes\nSince the Tang and Song dynasties, countless alchemical texts have expounded the wondrous principles of the Mysterious Pass, yet I have never seen anyone point out the two Mysterious Passes—inner and outer. Since the medicine, furnace, and cauldron are distinguished as inner and outer, it is evident that the Mysterious Pass must also have inner and outer aspects. Here, I will not shirk the risk of disclosure and reveal them further:\n\nWhen heart and breath interdepend in the emptiness outside,\nMerged into one, this is the Outer Mysterious Pass.\nWithin it lies Wu Earth, the root of the Nine Returns.\n“Outside” refers to beyond the physical body.\nWhen the heart and breath outside settle into stillness,\nAnd stillness deepens into profound tranquility,\nWithin the physical body, the same ○ symbol appears.\nThis inner purity, where no thought arises and no intention moves,\nIs the Inner Mysterious Pass.\nWhen the Inner Mysterious Pass manifests,\nThe Four Symbols naturally unite,\nKan and Li naturally merge,\nWater and fire spontaneously achieve harmony,\nThe Five Phases naturally gather,\nAnd the work of the Seven Returns is naturally accomplished.\nWithin it lies Ji Earth.\nWhen inner and outer merge in darkness,\nAnd Wu and Ji Earths fuse,\nThis is the wondrous realm of “mouth to mouth, cavity to cavity”—\nBeyond words or writing, known only through silent accord.\n\nWhen the Outer Mysterious Pass manifests,\nThe entire body naturally softens with bliss,\nIn a state of fleeting obscurity,\nThe primordial qi arrives of its own accord,\nThe medicine spontaneously generates,\nAnd the wondrous effects of the Nine Returns unfold.\nThus, the outer return and inner reversal\nCause true qi to flourish ever more,\nAnd the original spirit to grow ever stronger.\nTrue yin and true yang intertwine,\nDrawing from Kan to fill Li.",

      "translated_text": "When the Li Palace is filled and the Yang Pass closes, the colored body reverts to that of a youth.\n\n**26. Inner and Outer Crucibles and Cauldrons**\nThe crucible and cauldron serve to contain the medicine. The distinction between \"inner\" and \"outer\" refers to the inner and outer medicines. The crucible is emptiness; the cauldron is also emptiness. Only emptiness can receive; only emptiness can contain. Thus, the wonder of the crucible and cauldron lies in their emptiness. Alchemical texts speak of the \"crescent-moon crucible,\" the \"cinnabar cauldron,\" or the \"Qian cauldron and Kun crucible,\" the \"golden cauldron and jade crucible,\" as well as the \"radiant cauldron\" and the \"suspended-embryo cauldron\"—all these are mentioned. Yet none have clearly revealed the two inner and outer cauldrons and crucibles. Here, I shall not shirk prolixity but disclose them plainly: the outer crucible and cauldron exist in the state where heart and breath interdepend to form this ○ realm. From this, the outer medicine is produced, accomplishing the work of the Nine Returns. The inner crucible and cauldron require the work to reach the state of great samādhi, where within the colored body true emptiness ○ is achieved. Upon attaining the inner Mysterious Pass, the inner crucible and cauldron are established. Thus, the inner crucible and cauldron pertain to the work of the Seven Returns, the crucible and cauldron used in the union of Kan and Li’s dragon and tiger—this is the principle of nature, the natural state of non-action and non-striving. As Master Ziyang said: *\"Within, there is the natural true fire; in the crucible, it blazes red without end.\"* The outer crucible and cauldron pertain to the work of life, the natural state of action and effort. As Master Ziyang said: *\"The outer crucible requires diligent effort in increasing and decreasing.\"* The outer crucible demands the union of Heaven and human effort, whereupon the inner crucible naturally *\"establishes the foundation of the myriad transformations.\"* This is what is meant by *\"the lodestone draws iron, penetrating barriers unseen.\"*\n\nIn sum, the work values great samādhi, where inner and outer are both purified, both empty. When the state of great samādhi and true emptiness is truly attained, the Wu and Ji Earths naturally merge, and the inner and outer crucibles and cauldrons are complete. Within, the Seven Returns; without, the Nine Returns. From true emptiness, wondrous being manifests; through wondrous being, true emptiness is embraced. Emptiness and being interpenetrate, wondrous apertures are equally perceived, states and wisdom merge, self and other dissolve, host and companion intermingle. Thus, the dharmadhātu becomes the crucible, the six great elements the medicine. Mobilizing the true fire of nature’s emptiness, one refines the dust-like ignorance, transforms the ordinary substance into a numinous body, transcends the leaky to become leakless, emerges from the five aggregates and turns the five turbidities—this is the great mechanism and great function of the Mysterious School.\n\n**27. Inner and Outer Dharma and Resources**\n\"Dharma\" refers to the guidelines of practice; \"resources\" refer to the materials for sustenance. In the cultivation of the Mysterious School’s primordial human perfection, nothing lies beyond the wondrous union of heart and breath, returning to the state before images and the Supreme Emperor, where *\"Heaven and human unite in effort\"* and *\"the foundation of the myriad transformations is established\"*—this is called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Herein, the most essential are the crucible and cauldron, the medicine, and the firing times. Only by thoroughly understanding the two states of prior and posterior Heaven, as well as the two dynamics within and beyond the body, can one enter the chamber and undertake the great work of the Seven Returns and Nine Returns—this is the inner dharma.\n\nOne must also arrange worldly affairs, cast aside distractions, maintain tranquility, and guard the heart from entanglements. The environment should be pure, daily life comfortable, worldly matters and human relations undisturbing. The mind should be at peace, the Daoist aspiration pure. The dwelling should be secluded, free from the sounds of poultry and dogs, the clamor of carriages and horses. Meals should consist of plain, soft, warm vegetarian dishes, with tobacco and alcohol strictly avoided. During practice, the body’s temperature must be carefully maintained—avoid drafts and do not seek coolness. In cold weather, cover with a light blanket; if the pores open, one may catch a cold. For those diligent in practice, frequent small meals are best, and all stimulating foods should be avoided. When walking, move slowly, and guard against anger and lust. If yang hyperactivity arises, one need only borrow a woman’s quilt and sleep for a night or two to resolve it. These aspects of clothing, food, shelter, and movement must be attended to and studied—this is the outer dharma, which supports practice and enhances efficiency. Alchemical texts do not discuss these; they are known through oral transmission from a teacher.\n\nInner resources are the primordial qi. Outer resources are worldly wealth, used to cover the expenses of Daoist cultivation—also called \"Daoist provisions.\" The construction of a cultivation chamber, the purchase of land, and daily expenditures must all be planned in advance. When both inner and outer dharma and resources are complete, practice proceeds without hindrance.\n\n**28. Inner and Outer Companions and Grounds**\n\"Companions\" are fellow practitioners of shared understanding. While one may practice alone at ordinary times, during the days of passing the great celestial orbit, two or three companions are indispensable to keep watch and provide warnings—their responsibility is immense. Inner companions are the heart and breath, stillness and illumination, samādhi and wisdom. In states where body and mind are settled and at peace, one takes emptiness as the Daoist arena and roams within it—this is the inner sitting ground. The alchemical chamber is the outer sitting ground.\n\n**29. Essential Teachings of the Western School**\nMaster Hanxu first encountered Immortal Sanfeng, then Patriarch Lü Chunyang, and synthesized the heart transmissions of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages. After attaining the Dao, he founded the Western School of the Great River. From Master Hanxu, the transmission passed to Master Wu Tianzhi, then to Master Wang—barely fifty or sixty years in all. I studied under Master Wang for four years, during which he repeatedly transmitted the teachings. I came to understand that the essential principle of the Western School’s transmission lies in great samādhi and true emptiness; all other return-and-reversal oral instructions and subtle firing times are but extensions of great samādhi and true emptiness.",

      "translated_text": "After examining the records, we find that after receiving the esoteric transmission from Ancestor Zhong, Patriarch Lü built a hermitage in the Zhongnan Mountains to cultivate and refine his practice. Yet his private thoughts remained unsettled, and thrice he approached the furnace without success. Ancestor Zhong said, “The human heart has not yet died, and the firing times lack strictness. You must once more still your mind and enter into great samādhi.” Patriarch Lü then asked, “In the profound obscurity where hun and po intermingle, how can one preserve the integral form?” Ancestor Zhong replied, “When wisdom arises from obscurity and the mind abides in great samādhi, spirit attains tranquility. Once spirit merges into unity, how could it fail to accord with the real? The golden body and jade essence are inherently refined through sincerity. When the great elixir is accomplished, the body becomes weightlessly airborne.”\n\nHe further said, “The myriad things flourish and each returns to its root. They blossom and bear flowers, yet each harms its own authenticity. Born at dawn, withered by dusk—what thing escapes this fate? I must turn inward and reflect: I, too, am a thing. Thus, I delve into the root, gather the numinous, depart from being and return to non-being, and revert to true emptiness. But first, one must eliminate the ten obstacles. For one is scorched by florid ornament, deluded by resonant clamor, nourished by rich delicacies, enveloped in fragrance, shown preferences of like and dislike, habituated to envy and flattery, enslaved by gold and jade, enticed by rank and emolument, seduced by sweet words, and deceived by cunning schemes. If these ten obstacles are not removed, one strays from nature and loses the Dao.”\n\nPatriarch Lü said, “The wondrous treasure is refined not by chance; only when true emptiness is realized does one attain transcendence.” These are all essential principles of great samādhi and true emptiness.\n\nMaster Sanfeng stated, “The matter that lies beyond this is the golden fluid returning elixir, where emotion returns to nature, reaching the state of true emptiness. The great function manifests, the Dragon Maiden offers the pearl, and golden light appears—only then is it a lasting attainment.” He also said, “I merely await the moment to stir the fire and refine true emptiness, seeking the light to break through primordial chaos.” And, “When true emptiness is realized and form vanishes, the dharmakāya abides eternally without falling into emptiness.” Again, “Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial revolution to forge true emptiness and return to the Great Non-being.” And, “Once the golden elixir is refined and true emptiness is realized, the body remains unmoved for thousands of years.” Such is the critical importance of true emptiness.\n\nOnly through great samādhi can one reach the state of true emptiness. Having attained true emptiness, one then accords with wondrous being, where emptiness and being merge perfectly, and form and spirit are both sublime. Thus, the profound principle of great samādhi and true emptiness is the pivotal point of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages, the mysterious essence of the nine returns and seven reversals.\n\nThe principle of great samādhi and true emptiness, though transmitted as the core teaching of the Western School of the Great River, when traced back to the sages of old, in fact originates in the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*. Does not Master Huzhi’s “Great Thoroughfare without trace” refer to true emptiness? Does not Zhuangzi’s “Heaven’s gate opens and closes, yet no form is seen” also refer to true emptiness? Again, “When the cosmos abides in tranquility, radiance issues forth from heaven,” “The Great Oneness flows through it,” “Great samādhi upholds it,” “Without end or beginning, without moment or time”—do these not speak of great samādhi? And when it says, “Abiding in the center of the circle to follow what comes,” does this not mean to remain in quiescent samādhi while manifesting in all conduct, the supreme achievement of sagely cultivation?\n\nThe principle of great samādhi and true emptiness in the Western School inherits the oral transmission of Ancestors Lü and Zhang, and distantly continues the mind-seal of the sages Zhuang and Lie. It synthesizes the great accomplishments of the Wenshi and Donghua lineages and accords with the Buddha’s mind-essence of “true mark without mark, the treasury of the true Dharma-eye.” It may be called the gate where Chan and Dao are not two.\n\n**30. Mind and Breath Interdependent**\nHaving understood the principle of “emptiness beyond the body,” one may proceed to practice. The work fundamentally consists of mind and breath interdependent, spirit and qi united, all projected outward. However, there are direct and indirect methods according to the teachings.\n\nThe indirect method, being subtly empty and wondrously quiescent, is difficult to grasp in form and thus more suitable for beginners. It involves using the ears to listen to the incoming and outgoing breath, which moves within the external emptiness (the emptiness outside the nostrils). If one can hear it without attaching to the physical body, this is the practice. Here, the mind is entrusted to the ears, the ears to the breath, and one reverses hearing to hear the breath itself, thereby making mind and breath interdependent. The practitioner should first engage in a month of quiet sitting to settle the mind, after which one may reverse hearing without clinging to the physical body, naturally entering the wondrous state.\n\nThe direct method places the spirit directly in the external emptiness (the emptiness outside the nose), where the breath’s coming and going is naturally known. The alchemical texts call this “settling the spirit in the ancestral aperture” or “congealing the spirit into the qi cavern” (both referring to the space about an inch outside the nostrils). When the spirit enters the qi cavern, the breath naturally harmonizes with it. The *Cantong Qi* says, “The true person hides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center,” illustrating the method of “direct interdependence.” *Zhuangzi* says, “In the midst of no sound, one alone hears harmony,” which is the method of “reversing hearing to hear the breath itself.”\n\nWhen mind and breath harmonize and merge, in the stillness one naturally hears the in-and-out movement—this is called “hearing harmony,” illustrating the method of “indirect interdependence.” In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong’s golden cudgel is stored nowhere else but in his ear, and when needed, he draws it out. This also illustrates the wondrous truth of “reversing hearing to hear the breath itself,” the method of indirect interdependence. The golden cudgel symbolizes the dynamic mechanism of the in-and-out breath. By using the ear’s root to illumine the breath, one harmonizes mind with breath and fuses spirit with qi, attaining the state of “returning to life and reverting to the root.” This is the unity of Sun Wukong’s essence and function. ○丨",

      "translated_text": "Thus stored within the ear, it subtly reveals the essence of breath regulation, employing the ear’s root as its function. According to the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, Avalokiteśvara’s illusion-like *śravaṇa* (hearing) and *vāsanā* (permeation) samādhi embodies the principle of “reversing hearing to hear one’s own nature, whereby nature fulfills the supreme Dao.” In the esoteric tradition of cultivation, this becomes “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath,” where both breath and thought dissolve as the entry point. From this, one attains true samādhi; from samādhi, wisdom arises; from wisdom, delusions are subdued—this is what is meant by “returning to the origin, where nature is non-dual, though expedient means are manifold.”\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s discourse on “hearing harmony” and *Journey to the West*’s imagery of “storing the cudgel” both point to the wondrous secret of “mind and breath interdependence.” How could one know the practice of “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” otherwise? The esoteric method of cultivation involves projecting one’s mind and breath outward into the vast emptiness. Emptiness represents the great heaven and earth, the primordial Qian and Kun. Mind and breath represent the small heaven and earth, the postnatal Kan and Li. Placing mind and breath within emptiness to interdepend is the union of “twofold heaven and earth, fourfold yin and yang”—what is called “heaven and human conjoined in activation.”\n\nMaster Lü (Lü Dongbin) said:\n*“Who can match the twofold heaven and earth?\nI arrange the fourfold yin and yang.”*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*“The four trigrams of Qian and Kun serve as bellows,\nCovering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang.”*\nThis describes the very work of this stage. Through interdependence, breath and thought gradually dissolve and transform, ultimately returning to emptiness. Laozi called this “returning to the root and reverting to life, attaining emptiness and abiding in stillness.” *Zhuangzi* termed it “learning the chaos” or “fasting of the mind.” All sages, in succession, regarded this as the essential practice.\n\nThis method of “mind and breath interdependence” was anciently called the “sun-moon conjoining method,” for the character *dan* (elixir) symbolizes the union of sun and moon. In *The Marvelous Encounter at Sea and Mountain*, when Master Zhongli Quan received the prophecy from the Bitter Bamboo True Lord, it was said: *“Hereafter, one with two mouths shall be your disciple”* (referring to Lü Dongbin). *“When you find this person, transmit to him my sun-moon conjoining method.”* An ancient song says:\n*“The sun moves into the bright moon—\nThis is the immortal’s initial work.”*\n\nMaster Zhongli’s song declares:\n*“The southern star shifts to the northern star’s place,\nThe golden crow flies into the jade toad’s palace.”*\n\nIn later times, it was expressed as:\n*“Congeal spirit into the qi cavity,”*\nor\n*“Settle spirit in the ancestral aperture.”*\nYet all these phrases are veiled; without an enlightened teacher, how could one begin? Thus, Master Ziyang (Zhang Boduan) wrote in the *Wuzhen Pian*:\n*“Only because the alchemical classics lack oral instructions,\nWhere can you form the sacred embryo?”*\n\nThe ancients said: *“The Daoist rides the ox backward.”* This also symbolizes mind and breath interdependence, reversing breath to merge with emptiness. Chen Xubai’s *Guidelines for Abiding Within* encapsulates the entire path in the four characters “mind and breath interdependence,” which is profoundly wondrous.\n\n“Reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” is the most marvelous expedient for entering the Dao. Since breath arises from the mind, it is originally the mind’s wind-phase. Reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath, spirit settles and breath follows; breath empties and mind follows. What was once moving is gathered into stillness. Stillness giving rise to movement is the return of the first yang—precisely the manifestation of being within non-being, where timing and spirit coincide.\n\nIn learning the Dao, one must empty the dusty realm and be unburdened by external things to attain its benefits. To empty the dusty realm, one must first empty the mind’s realm. “Mind and breath interdependence” is the wondrous method for emptying the mind’s realm: projecting the mind outward to follow the breath, which empties itself without effort. The jade flute of Zi Jin (Wangzi Qiao) and the bamboo flute of Xiao Shi both symbolize “mind and breath interdependence.” The *Wisdom Sword Song* of Li Daochun, the Daoist sword of Lü Dongbin, and the sharp-edged sword of Master Zhang Sanfeng all represent this same principle.\n\nReversing hearing to hear one’s own breath, hearing ceases at the breath, not grasping the five external dusts—this is “wondrous cessation.” The in-and-out movement of breath is naturally known by the mind; knowing yet abiding in stillness is “wondrous contemplation.” Spirit is wondrous emptiness; breath is wondrous being. When spirit and breath harmonize and congeal into oneness, this is “wondrous center.” Thus, “reversing hearing to hear one’s own breath” encompasses the three contemplations, merging clarity and stillness, uniting cessation and contemplation. Entering the Dao through this method is most simple and wondrous.\n\n*“The valley spirit does not die—\nThis is called the mysterious female.”*\nValley and spirit, mysterious and female—both pair being and non-being, yin and yang, subtly revealing the secret of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\n*“Abiding continuously as if present,\nIts use is never forced.”*\nThis is the method of neither forgetting nor aiding, where opening and closing arise naturally, evenly and gently, merging into oneness.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*“When harmonized, they follow.”*\nThese four characters perfectly capture the wondrousness of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\n*“Abiding continuously as if present,\nIts use is never forced.”*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Concentrate qi to attain suppleness,\nEmbrace the One without separation.”*\nThis is Laozi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Hearing no sound, attuned to harmony,\nTrue breath reaches the heels.”*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Riding the wind (breath), treading emptiness,\nMind congeals, form dissolves (entering samādhi),\nBone and flesh fuse in harmony.”*\nThis is Liezi’s method of breath regulation.\n\n*“Mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit,\nSpirit unites with non-being.”*\nThis is Master Kangcang’s (Laozi’s disciple) method of breath regulation.",

      "translated_text": "In ancient Daoist cultivation, one begins with breath regulation—this can be trusted. The interdependence of mind and breath is the non-dual gateway of the Mysterious School, through which one attains the state where body and mind are one, waking and sleeping are undivided.\n\nWhen spirit is released outward, following the breath with ease, and I merely observe with subtle awareness—this is the Mysterious School’s \"observing self-so.\" When spirit is released outward, following the breath’s ebb and flow, naturally merging with the body—this is the Mysterious School’s \"Tathāgatagarbha.\" With prolonged practice, mind and breath are both forgotten, and one effortlessly enters samādhi. After long abiding in samādhi, profound stillness arises—this is the Mysterious School’s \"Ocean of Quiescence.\"\n\nTurning the ear to listen inwardly to the breath’s ingress and egress, then hearing merges with the breath, and the breath dissolves into nothingness—this is the Mysterious School’s practice of entering *samādhi* through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation. In true samādhi, the breath naturally ceases its movement. If even a subtle breath remains, it is not true samādhi. In true samādhi, thoughts naturally cease arising and vanishing. If even a trace of arising or vanishing remains, it is not true samādhi.\n\nWhen mind and breath interdepend in emptiness, still yet not nonexistent, moving yet not substantial—this is the wondrous functioning of true suchness. Moreover, when mind and breath interdepend in emptiness, stillness and illumination are inseparable, tranquility and wisdom nurture each other—this is the equal cultivation of samādhi and prajñā.\n\nThe interdependence of mind and breath is a scroll of the wordless true sutra, a most wondrous *huatou*. The interdependence of mind and breath is the moon-in-water *dāochǎng*, the harmony of *sānmèi*, the liberation of dwelling in illusion. The interdependence of mind and breath is a seamless pagoda, an empty king’s hall, a rootless tree. The interdependence of mind and breath is the Mysterious School’s staff, the Mysterious School’s Vajra King’s sword.\n\nHan Qingfu’s poem says:\n*“Silently holding a stringless lute,\nGently blowing a holeless flute.\nOne pluck and heaven and earth clear,\nOne blow and heaven and earth vast.\nOne blow and one pluck,\nAll are celestial melodies.”*\nThis illustrates the image of “mind and breath interdependence.”\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s poem says:\n*“The vast cosmos, a lute played thrice,\nBreath harmonized, a single flute.\nTo transcend the world through yin and yang,\nOne must cultivate beyond yin and yang.”*\nIn these four lines, the first two depict “mind and breath interdependence,” while the latter two point to the “emptiness beyond the body.”\n\nConcentrating spirit in emptiness to attain samādhi is called “sitting within the chamber of spirit”—the sublime essence of the Mysterious School’s seated meditation. Moreover, concentrating spirit in emptiness without clinging to the physical form is the Mysterious School’s “unbroken worldly appearance” form of renunciation.\n\nThe alchemical tradition takes the “wondrous union of mind and breath” as its crucible and furnace. The locus of this wondrous union is the external emptiness, termed the “Mysterious Aperture.” *The Pointers to the Nature and Life* states: *“Boundless emptiness is the Mysterious Aperture; knowing yet not fixating is the practice.”* This can be verified.\n\nZhou Dunyi’s *Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity* says: *“The true of the Limitless, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously unite and congeal.”* This “wondrous union” is the Dao of inner alchemy. “Wondrously unite and congeal” is what Li Daochun called “mind and breath interdepend to form the sacred embryo.”\n\nThrough the wondrous union and congealment of mind and breath, the internal and external qi mechanisms are all pacified—this is the sublime essence of Master Hu’s “balancing the qi mechanism.” Entering great samādhi through this is the practice of Zhuangzi’s “resting in the great equilibrium.”\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* reveals the six great elements—earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness—pervading and containing all. In the Mysterious School’s cultivation, mind uniting with breath is the “consciousness great” merging with the “wind great.” Breath uniting with emptiness is the “wind great” returning to the “space great.” When the nature of space is perfectly luminous, one attains liberation in dharma, consciousness transforms into wisdom, and the patience of non-arising is realized.\n\nBai Yuchan said: *“A word or half a phrase penetrates the mystery—what need for thousands of volumes of alchemical texts?”* Ancestor Zhong said: *“A few words, half a phrase, no many characters—ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures distilled into one phrase.”* He also said: *“One secret reveals matters beyond heaven; all side doors vanish without a trace.”* All refer to the oral instructions of mind and breath interdependence.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *“Thus, the method of the Great Elixir is most simple and easy. Even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, immediately transcend to the realm of sages.”* Master Qianxu said: *“The ancient immortals’ alchemical methods number no less than a thousand scrolls. Reading them only brings more confusion and difficulty; awakening reveals their utmost simplicity and ease.”* Master Sanfeng said: *“The work of returning the elixir is most simple and easy.”* Chen Cuixu said: *“It is precisely because of the simplicity and wondrousness of the celestial mechanism that it is scattered throughout alchemical texts yet never revealed.”* This “simplicity” is nothing other than inwardly hearing one’s own breath and the interdependence of mind and breath.\n\nThe wise and the foolish alike all possess this mind, all possess this breath, all can inwardly hear, and all can attain realization. Thus, Confucius said: *“Even the ignorant among husbands and wives can understand it; even the unworthy among husbands and wives can practice it.”* It is the most universal and easily cultivated method.\n\nIn the past, by karmic conditions, I encountered Master Wang, who pointed out this method of mind and breath interdependence. Only then did I know that the Mysterious School indeed possesses a true transmission. Now, this profound discourse directly reveals the orally transmitted secrets, making public the untransmitted secrets of four thousand years. It is because I cannot bear the Dao’s obscurity and silence that I wish to share this with those who love the Dao, to cultivate and realize together, attaining the benefits of body-mind peace and the effects of prolonging life and extending longevity!\n\n**31. Mind and Breath Interdependence (Part Two)**\nThe Mysterious School returns to the Limitless through mind and breath interdependence—this is long established. But what of the Buddhists?\n\nIt may be answered: The Buddhist *Ānāpānasmṛti Sūtra*, *Dhyāna Secret Essential Methods Sūtra*, and *Dharmatrāta Dhyāna Sūtra* all expound the principles of breath regulation.",

      "translated_text": "The Sanskrit term *ānāpāna* translates as \"inhalation and exhalation,\" which is the *ānāpānasmṛti* or \"contemplation of breath-counting.\" This differs slightly from the Daoist method of breath regulation, for the Daoist school’s interdependence of mind and breath does not rely on counting. The Tiantai school’s *Six Subtle Gates* also begins with breath regulation. The Six Subtle Gates are: first, breath-counting; second, breath-following; third, cessation; fourth, contemplation; fifth, return; and sixth, purity. When the mind follows the breath, this is interdependence; when interdependence reaches its limit, it enters samādhi—this is cessation. Within samādhi, wisdom and awareness arise, luminous and undivided—this is contemplation. Gold returns to its nature, reverting to the origin and restoring the primordial—this is return. The six senses become pure, and the realm of wisdom and insight attains wondrous emptiness—this is purity. These may also be harmonized with the Daoist school, though the Daoist path of cultivation and realization most closely aligns with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s principle of \"reversing the breath to empty the space, dissolving the breath to manifest illumination.\"\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, Cūḍapanthaka says: \"The Buddha, pitying my ignorance, taught me to dwell in stillness and regulate my inhalation and exhalation. I observed my breath, tracing its subtlety to its utmost, witnessing its arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing—all phenomena in an instant. My mind suddenly became vast and unobstructed, and I attained arhatship, free from outflows. Seated beneath the Buddha’s seat, I was confirmed as one beyond study. When the Buddha asked about the foremost means of perfect penetration, I testified that reversing the breath to empty the space was supreme.\"\n\nSundarananda says: \"When I first left home to follow the Buddha, though I upheld the precepts, my mind in samādhi remained scattered and unsettled, and I had not attained freedom from outflows. The World-Honored One taught me, along with Kauṇḍinya, to observe the whiteness at the tip of the nose. For twenty-one days, I focused intently and saw the breath issuing from my nostrils like smoke. My body and mind became inwardly luminous, and the world around me turned utterly still and empty, like transparent beryl. The smoke-like breath gradually dissolved, and my nasal breath became white. My mind opened, outflows ceased, and all inhalation and exhalation transformed into radiant light, illuminating the ten directions. I attained arhatship, and the World-Honored One predicted my future attainment of bodhi. When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, I replied that dissolving the breath and allowing illumination to arise—whereby illumination becomes complete and outflows are extinguished—was supreme.\"\n\nNote: The Daoist school reverses the breath from its presence to its absence, entering profound tranquility, which precisely accords with the principles of reversing and dissolving the breath. After profound tranquility, with deeper practice, the light of the mind manifests—this is the sign of illumination. Since the entry point is the same, all effects and verifications naturally do not differ.\n\nTurning to the Confucian school, the *Book of Changes*’ hexagram *Sui* (Following) states in its image and judgment: \"Thunder within the marsh: the image of Following. In correspondence with this, the noble person, toward evening, enters into rest and ceases activity.\" This is Confucius’ method of breath regulation. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; without ceasing, it endures; enduring, it manifests.\" This is Zisi’s method of breath regulation. Mencius says: \"There must be the task, yet do not forget it; rectify the mind without forgetting, yet do not force its growth.\" This is Mencius’ method of breath regulation. Terms such as \"heel-breathing,\" \"restful breathing,\" \"reversed breathing,\" \"spiritual breathing,\" \"embryonic breathing,\" and \"unceasing breathing\" all express the principle of \"interdependence of mind and breath.\"\n\nWhen sound harmonizes with the ear, it is called \"hearing harmony.\" The breath’s ingress and egress are supremely soft and harmonious, and only I can hear it. Shao Yong calls this \"heavenly hearing.\" Lü Dongbin says: \"In stillness, listen to the stringless melody, subtly penetrating the mechanism of creation and transformation.\" Qiu Changchun’s *Song of the Azure Sky* says: \"Leisurely singing the White Snow song within the gourd, quietly tuning the Spring of Yang beyond the world. This music of mine arises naturally, played on a flute without holes, a zither without strings. Awakened, it startles one from the dream of floating life; day and night, its pure sound fills the grotto-heaven.\" These all reveal the wonder of \"hearing harmony,\" the mechanism of \"heavenly hearing,\" and the subtle function of regulating the breath to unite with the spirit.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"The true person of old did not dream when sleeping, was not disturbed when awake, did not relish food, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat.\" This is the verification of the interdependence of mind and breath. \"Deeply\" describes a breath that is long and subtle, unlike the short and coarse breath of ordinary people. \"Heels\" does not refer to the soles of the feet but signifies the mind following the breath, as steps follow one another without separation—each step heels the one before, and the one before heels the one after, following without parting, merging into one. This is precisely the image of the interdependence of mind and breath, continuous and unbroken.\n\nMaster Qianxu says: \"Reaching the heels means the interdependence of mind and breath, returning to their root.\" Chen Xubai says: \"The opening and closing of *qi*’s subtle movements are infinitely wondrous. After a short while, one must forget the breath and unite with the spirit, returning to primordial chaos. When emptiness is taken to its extreme and stillness is upheld with utmost sincerity, the mind does not stir with thoughts, without coming or going, without exiting or entering, abiding in pure tranquility—this is the true person’s breath reaching the heels.\" Master Wang once said: \"Only when one remains in samādhi for two or three hours is it the true person’s breath reaching the heels.\" Though interpretations vary in depth, their ultimate aim is nothing other than prolonged interdependence leading to profound tranquility.\n\n*Zhuangzi* discusses the \"interdependence of mind and breath\" in several passages. The \"Worldly Affairs\" chapter says: \"Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*. The ears’ function is only to hear (the ancient text mistakenly reads 'hearing stops with the ears'), and the mind’s function is only to accord (with the breath).\" The \"Great and Venerable Teacher\" chapter says: \"The true person of old breathed deeply; the true person’s breath reached the heels, while ordinary people’s breath reached only the throat.\" The \"Keeping the Free and Easy\" chapter says: \"I guard the One and abide in harmony.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter says: \"In the midst of soundlessness, one alone hears harmony.\" The *\"Mountain Trees\"* chapter says: \"Now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times, rising and falling—harmony as their measure.\" The *\"Gengsang Chu\"* chapter says: \"To attain stillness, *qi* must be level.\" The *\"Tian Zifang\"* chapter says: \"Now I observe the space between your nostrils—*xuxu* indeed! How does your mind employ itself?\" The two characters *xuxu* depict the harmony and subtlety of the breath, its movement so fine, conveying a state of leisurely ease, serene joy, and unforced contentment—truly sublime beyond compare.\n\n32. **The Samadhi of Harmonious Union (I. The Mysterious Origin)**\nLi Changyuan says: \"Seek only where the true person breathes, and let the alchemical maiden fly to and fro.\" Master Lü says: \"Ride the winds and clouds to their true meeting; seek the phoenix’s secret harmony.\" Master Sanfeng says: \"Though bodies be apart, spirit communes in profound detail—clearly, the two must match in practice.\" These all reveal the esoteric meaning of \"mind and breath in union.\"\n\nMind and breath are heaven’s natural pair, not forged by artifice. In the Mysterious Origin, when mind unites with breath, spirit and *qi* merge in darkness, metal and wood intermingle—this is the samadhi of harmonious union. All alchemical processes—nine returns, seven reversions, the microcosmic and macrocosmic orbits, even the transformation of the embryo and the liberation of spirit—emerge from and return to this samadhi. Yet this samadhi requires entering the wondrous realm of dim obscurity, primordial chaos, and boundless emptiness before true harmonious union is achieved.\n\nThus, Master Guangcheng says: \"The essence of the supreme Dao is dim and obscure; preserve non-being to embrace being, and in an instant it is accomplished.\" Master Heshang says: \"Dim and obscure, it opens the gates of all wonders; vague and indistinct, it guards the true aperture.\" Master Luo Gongyuan says: \"In dim obscurity, without form or image, the true person appears within the jeweled pearl.\" Master Ge the Immortal says: \"It arises in dim obscurity and abides in vagueness.\" Master Lü says: \"Dim and obscure, it gives birth to vagueness; vague and indistinct, it coalesces into a mass.\" The ancient immortals all transcended through this samadhi of harmonious union—truly, this is no deception.\n\nIn worldly unions of men and women, the generative process follows the natural course to produce life. Here, mind and breath interdepend in the wondrous harmony of yin and yang, reversing the flow to attain sagehood. Thus, Master Cuixu says: \"When the tenth month’s jade frost descends, the sacred embryo is complete, and the wind and thunder roar. After a year, the embryo gives birth to a child, who begets grandchildren, and grandchildren beget descendants.\"\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When body and mind unite and grow day by day, one roams within the womb of the Dao and intimately serves the lineage of awakening.\" How wondrous! This samadhi of harmonious union is truly the compassionate vessel across the sea of suffering, the precious raft for ferrying beings to liberation.\n\nIn the *\"Entering the Realm of Reality\"* chapter of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, when Sudhana visits his fifty-third teacher, he encounters the youth Deśa and the maiden Deva residing in a city called the Gate of Wondrous Intent, where they expound the Dharma-gate of Liberation through Illusory Abiding. This, too, conveys the esoteric meaning of mind and breath in union—the samadhi of harmonious union.\n\nObserve that all the spiritual guides Sudhana met earlier appeared alone, but here they form a pair. What else could this represent if not the symbol of one yin and one yang, the interdependence of mind and breath? The \"Gate of Wondrous Intent\" is akin to the Laozi’s \"Gate of All Wonders\" and \"Mysterious Female Gate.\" The character *wondrous* also evokes the image of youthful boy and girl, a word embodying the union of yin and yang.\n\nWhen mind and breath harmonize, there arises a subtle mutual awareness—is this not wondrous intent? Mind follows breath like phoenixes in harmony, a natural union of husband and wife, yet the man does not loosen his robes, nor the woman untie her sash. They revere each other as divine and cherish one another as infants—is this not Illusory Abiding? Thus it is called \"Liberation through Illusory Abiding.\"\n\nUltimately, in great samadhi and true samadhi, there is no coming or going, no exiting or entering. Inner and outer are both forgotten, body and mind utterly still. Empty and quiescent, without reliance—this is called \"Non-Abiding.\" From illusion one attains Non-Abiding, and the work of mysterious cultivation is complete.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: \"Then, after the youth and maiden had expounded their own liberation, by the power of inconceivable roots of goodness, they made Sudhana’s body soft and radiant.\" The commentary explains: *Soft* refers to the state where, through the interdependence of mind and breath, the entire body becomes supple. *Radiant* describes the primordial light and *qi* emanating from the skin, manifesting externally.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"The body generates radiant light, and the *qi* is fragrant as orchids.\" Master Zhongli says: \"Jade nectar flows, moistening and generating luminosity.\" These convey the same meaning.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *\"Song of the Primordial Immortal for Li Yuanyang\"* says: \"The Daoist Yuanyang plays in truth, abandoning office as if it were a worn-out sandal in his quest for the Dao.\"",

The Samādhi of Harmonious Union (II. Chan School)**\nWhen Layman Pang studied under Chan Master Shitou Xiqian and attained awakening, he presented this verse:\n\n*\"In daily life, no other task—\nonly my own harmonious union.\nEverywhere, no grasping or rejecting,\nin all places, no discord.\nWho distinguishes crimson from purple?\nThe hills and mountains are free of dust.\nMiracles and wondrous function—\nhauling water, carrying firewood.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Mind like circumstances, circumstances like mind—\nneither substantial nor void.\nThe existent is not clung to,\nthe nonexistent is not constrained.\nNot sages or worthies—\nsimply ordinary beings.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Mind like circumstances, circumstances like mind—\ntrue wisdom arises from suchness.\nSamādhi and wisdom adorn equally,\nexpounding the pāramitās far and wide.\"*\n\nThe Daoist school takes the harmonious union of mind and breath as the foundational practice, while the Chan school regards the harmonious union of mind and circumstances as the wondrous proof of the Way. After breaking through the heavy barrier, body, mind, and world dissolve into vast emptiness—all is fused into one realm. Whether form or fragrance, all is the Middle Way. Wielding the staff, holding the tablet—both accord with non-arising. All dharmas are merged into the realm of self-nature, the myriad phenomena like reflections in the ocean’s mirror. Thus it is said: *\"Mind like circumstances, neither substantial nor void.\"*\n\nBaizhang Duan’s verse reads:\n*\"The ape’s cry in the frosty moonlit night,\nthe flower’s smile in the garden of spring’s warmth.\nAmidst the boundless red dust,\neverywhere, old friends.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrousness of the Chan school’s harmonious union. From the harmonious union of mind and breath to the realization of the harmonious union of mind and circumstances, the Daoist and Chan schools are united as one.\n\n---\n\n**34. The Samādhi of Singular Emptiness**\nFrom the interdependence of mind and breath arises the dual stabilization of spirit and breath. With prolonged stabilization, body and mind become profoundly still—inner and outer are both empty. This is called *\"the samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* states:\n*\"The term ‘one’ is like empty space. All myriad things arise and grow within it. When the bodhisattva’s true emptiness manifests, faith and other virtues all flourish.\"*\nThus it is named *\"the samādhi of singular emptiness,\"* also called *\"the samādhi of the singular dharma-realm.\"*\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* further states:\n*\"The term ‘one’ is the dharma-realm. The dharma-realm is also empty. Through the power of samādhi, this emptiness manifests—it is called the adorned samādhi of the singular dharma-realm.\"*\n\nThus, the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says:\n*\"Subtle and continuous, as if existing—\nits use is effortless.\"*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s samādhi of harmonious union.\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Spirit enters its gate,\nbones and frame return to their root—\nwhat ‘I’ remains?\"*\nThis is the Yellow Emperor’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Carrying your soul and embracing the One—\ncan you never part from it?\nConcentrating your *qi* to attain suppleness—\ncan you be like a newborn child?\"*\nThis is the ancient sage’s samādhi of harmonious union.\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Return to the root of nothingness,\nreturn to the limitless—\nI alone drift, without sign,\nlike an infant who has not yet smiled.\nVast and open, like a valley—\nstill, as if nowhere to abide.\"*\nThis is the ancient sage’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Now a dragon, now a snake—\ntransforming with the times.\nNow ascending, now descending—\nharmony as the measure.\"*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"samādhi of harmonious union.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Emerging without origin,\nentering without end—\nin entering and emerging, no form is seen.\nThis is called the Gate of Heaven.\nThe Gate of Heaven is nothingness.\nYet within this nothingness, there is no-thing—\nthe sage abides herein.\"*\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"*\n\nThe ancient sages first entered the *\"samādhi of harmonious union,\"* then advanced to the *\"samādhi of singular emptiness.\"* Externally, they relinquished the world; internally, they transcended body and mind. Freed from form, without reliance, they soared beyond the mundane—this is how the Yellow Emperor entered emptiness and communed with Guangcheng, directly realizing the wondrous cultivation of the dharma-nature body.\n\n---\n\n**35. The Stages of Elixir Cultivation**\nIn the Daoist school’s practice, the interdependence of mind and breath is fundamental throughout. Its sequential stages may be divided into three barriers of effort: *\"forgetting form to nurture *qi*, forgetting *qi* to nurture spirit, forgetting spirit to nurture emptiness.\"* The *Guidelines on Nature and Life* adds a fourth stage, *\"refining emptiness to merge with the Dao\"* (more accurately, *\"forgetting emptiness to merge with the Dao\"*), though one must not cling rigidly to these divisions.\n\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n*\"In a single moment of stillness, within that moment lie the efforts of refining essence into *qi*, refining *qi* into spirit, and refining spirit to return to emptiness—not only in the ten-month period. This holds true for an hour, a day, a month, or a year. Sitting with eyes closed, concentrating the spirit, calming the mind and regulating the breath—this is the work of refining essence into *qi*. Turning the light inward, focusing the spirit in the elixir field, allowing the true breath to flow—within, stillness reaches its extreme and stirs, movement reaches its extreme and stills. Infinite celestial mechanisms—this is the work of refining *qi* into spirit.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ibes the primordial light and *qi* emanating from the skin, manifesting externally.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"The body generates radiant light, and the *qi* is fragrant as orchids.\" Master Zhongli says: \"Jade nectar flows, moistening and generating luminosity.\" These convey the same meaning.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *\"Song of the Primordial Immortal for Li Yuanyang\"* says: \"The Daoist Yuanyang plays in truth, abandoning office as if it were a worn-out sandal in his quest for the Dao.\"",

      "translated_text": "I propose:\n\nThe stages of the elixir Way may be broadly divided into three parts.\n\nThe first is the preliminary practice. At the outset of learning, one employs the method of mind and breath interdependent, so that spirit and *qi* unite externally. Gradually they become harmonious, gradually subtle, gradually faint, passing from indistinct obscurity into the cessation of breathing and the great serenity of perfect samādhi—this is called the preliminary practice. The goal of the preliminary practice is to attain samādhi, for all elixir methods rest upon the foundation of great samādhi.\n\nThe second is the main practice. From the cessation of breathing and the great samādhi of spirit and *qi*, one proceeds to the seven returns and nine reversions, replenishing the primordial, which the elixir texts call the “minor celestial orbit.” Next, once the primordial is replenished, one ceases the fire and coagulates the elixir. Next, one nurtures the elixir. Next, when the elixir is full, one circulates the great celestial orbit. Next, one obtains the great medicine and performs the seven-day work of the great celestial orbit. Next, one embraces the origin and nurtures the embryo. Next, when the embryo is complete, the spirit emerges. Next, one nurses and returns to emptiness, and the transformations of the divided body are all at ease. This is called the main practice. The goal of the main practice is to return to emptiness.\n\nThe third is the final completion of the Way. Function is exhausted and effort forgotten, emptiness is shattered to atoms. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang says in his *Poem of Self-Congratulation*: “Parting with the child who rides the crane away, / Emptiness shattered to atoms, the whole body appears.” This is the message of the final completion. The final step must thoroughly realize one’s own nature and the mind of the First Principle; the elixir texts rarely record it, and one should study the *Śūraṅgama*, *Avataṃsaka*, and *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* to attain it.\n\n36. The Mao-You Bath\nMao and You represent the image of central harmony; the elixir texts liken them to a bath. Bathing means retiring and resting. I have heard from former masters: “Once the work reaches great samādhi, it is bathing and nurturing.” In elixir methods, the interdependence of breath is the martial fire, and breathless samādhi is the civil fire. When the work reaches great samādhi, thoughts are without arising or ceasing, breath without exit or entry, body and mind both still—this is precisely the time for bathing. In the Perfected One of Purple Clarity’s *Secret of the Mysterious Pass*, the bath at the Mao gate is one barrier, and the bath at the You portal is another. Longmeizi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* discusses bathing: “Refining the elixir is originally a year’s work, / But for two months one must halt the work. / When the hare meets the first full moon, cease; / When the cock meets the mid-autumn, end.” This is originally a matter of principle, and students must not cling rigidly to it. Have you not heard Purple Yang’s *Four Hundred Words*? “The firing times are not fixed; / The winter solstice is not at Zi. / As for the bathing method, / Mao and You are also empty comparisons.” The *Cantong qi* says: “Entrust your will to return to emptiness, / Taking non-thought as the constant.” This truly points to the essence of bathing, yet nothing is as direct and straightforward as my teacher’s pointing to the word “samādhi” as bathing. In samādhi, body and mind are both quiescent; within this quiescent samādhi, the primordial yang naturally receives nurturing, and the embryo of the Way naturally grows, without the danger of collapse.\n\n37. The Minor and Major Celestial Orbits\nThe terms “minor celestial orbit” and “major celestial orbit” did not exist before the Tang. When Master Cui wrote the *Mirror for Taking the Medicine* and Master Boyang composed the *Cantong qi*, neither used these terms. They first appeared in texts from the Yuan and Ming dynasties onward. Once these terms existed, various schools took the opportunity to expound upon them.",

      "translated_text": "I hold that the human body is itself a small heaven and earth, where qi and blood circulate in a single day and night as one celestial orbit. Daoist methods take heaven and earth as their model, requiring that this small heaven and earth of my body merge and dissolve into the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun. Only then can one “unite virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, sequence with the four seasons, and auspices and ills with ghosts and spirits,” thereby attaining the opportunity to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood.\n\nIf we now distinguish between them, the terms “minor celestial orbit” and “major celestial orbit” may be explained in three ways:\n\n**First**, the minor celestial orbit is the circulation of qi through the orbit, while the major celestial orbit is the circulation of spirit through the orbit. Yet both the circulation of qi and the circulation of spirit occur within samādhi, differing only in the depth of practice.\n\nWhy so? During the refinement of essence into qi, with my emptiness and quiescence, I summon the external true yang to enter my body. When true yang arrives, the entire body feels soft and supple; from softness it turns to numbness, from numbness it enters a state of primordial chaos, unaware and unknowing, like a living corpse. At this time, my body equals emptiness, my mind equals space—heaven and earth’s emptiness is my emptiness. My small heaven and earth dissolve and merge into the great heaven and earth of Qian and Kun. The true yang of all emptiness and the entire dharma-realm nurtures my body, penetrating within and without, from crown to sole.\n\nAs Lü Dongbin said: *“White clouds ascend to the celestial gate; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.”* This is precisely the landscape of qi circulating through the celestial orbit. Master Ge Xuan said: *“The fire of Li excites the sea; the water of Kan ascends to emptiness. Jade fluid irrigates; the bridal chamber streams with tassels. The celestial mechanism is revealed; the myriad sounds cannot compare.”* The *Cantong qi* states: *“Unceasing cultivation brings the qi like clouds and rain, gently as spring rain, fluidly as melting ice. From head it flows to feet, then ultimately ascends again, coming and going through the boundless, suffusing all within.”* Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Song* says: *“Await its single point to return and submit; within the body, the four seasons turn to spring. A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance, each rain renews. All day long, languid as a drunkard, idly guarding the spring within the cave. The body’s yin essence is entirely stripped away, transformed into a mass of pure yang. At this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death, forged into a single whole—the perfected true.”* Longmeizi’s *Poem on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* says: *“Each dawn, golden crucible smoke ascends; qi suffices, the river chariot ascends to heaven. Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand things; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.”* All these describe the methods and verifications of qi circulating through the celestial orbit.\n\nWhen refining qi into spirit, both spirit and breath settle within emptiness. The primordial true yang enters my physical body, circulates once around, and because the master dwells outside, the physical body becomes like an empty house. The spirit then departs the physical body and arrives in emptiness, embracing the master. As spirit settles, qi follows and settles. With spirit and qi both settled for a long time, qi is entirely transformed into spirit, leaving only a single radiant power blazing through emptiness—this is the verification of the embryo’s completion. Entering this gate of great quiescence and illumination, the original nature of emptiness merges with the six great elements. The dharma-nature of the six great elements and my true nature become non-dual, without separation between self and other, with self and things as one. Thereupon, one can enter water and fire, penetrate metal and stone, and manifest all manner of inconceivable spiritual powers—all verifications of spirit circulating through the celestial orbit.\n\nThus, in terms of qi and spirit circulation, there is the distinction between minor and major celestial orbits. The minor celestial orbit is the samādhi of refining essence into qi; the major celestial orbit is the samādhi of refining qi into spirit. This is the first explanation.\n\n**Second**, in terms of the minor and major returns, there is the same circulation of qi, yet again a distinction between minor and major celestial orbits.\n\nWhy so? During the minor return, the body’s interior remains the postnatal Kan and Li. When practice reaches the extreme of emptiness and profound quiescence, one senses the primordial pure yang qi entering the physical body, replenishing the losses incurred after the breaking of the body. Thus, my pure yin senses that pure yang. When the pure yang qi arrives, the entire body feels soft, numb, and throbbing. Each time the whole body experiences this softness and numbness, it receives the steaming of true yang once, completing one minor celestial orbit. Gradually gathering and refining in this way, when qi is sufficient, the fire is stopped, and the body returns to a youthful state. At this time, the Li palace is filled, and the body’s interior has become the Qian trigram, purely primordial. Then, with my Qian yang, I sense the Qian yang in emptiness; the primordial within the body and the primordial outside respond and unite, mutually congealing. This is the major return, combining the two layers of true yin and yang within and without.\n\nAt this stage of practice, the power of samādhi can reach two or three hours or more. Each time one settles into quiescence, sensing the Qian yang outside the body and uniting it with the Qian yang within, this constitutes one major celestial orbit, continuing until the great elixir is completed. Thus, the minor and major celestial orbits derive their names from the minor and major returns. The minor celestial orbit is used in returning from the postnatal to the primordial; the major celestial orbit is used when returning from the primordial to that which precedes the primordial. Though both are quiescence and the same circulation of qi, the depth of practice differs, as do the effects upon the physical body. The minor celestial orbit can only restore hair; the major celestial orbit can restore teeth, blood, even bones, marrow, and pupils, making one entirely new.",

      "translated_text": "This is the efficacy of the *Book of Changes*’ \"renewing the old and establishing the new.\" The minor celestial orbit is a method for peaceful longevity, while the major celestial orbit is the work of transcending the mundane and entering sagehood—this is the distinction between their depth. Thirdly, they are differentiated by the minor and major heavens and earth. The human body is a minor heaven and earth, while the cosmos outside the body is a major heaven and earth. When the adept’s practice reaches the state of indistinct obscurity, primordial chaos, and profound quiescence, yang arises, and the yang qi surges through the hundred meridians. The primordial harmony circulates internally, ascending to the crown and descending to the heels, the qi flowing in an unbroken cycle. This pertains to the minor heaven and earth of the human body, hence called the minor celestial orbit. If, in the state of indistinct obscurity, one becomes even more vacuous, the entire body softens, numbs, and pulsates—then the eighty-four thousand pores all receive the infusion of the true yang qi from the external cosmos. At this moment of extreme vacuity and profound stillness, one wondrously merges with the Great Void. The physical body has become true emptiness, freely allowing the true yang qi of the Great Void to permeate and harmonize, penetrating both internally and externally, from crown to sole, circulating without obstruction. This pertains to the union with the Great Void of the major heaven and earth, hence called the major celestial orbit.\n\nThus, according to the former explanation, the adept first practices the minor celestial orbit, then the major celestial orbit. According to the latter explanation, the adept first practices the major celestial orbit, then the minor celestial orbit. After completing the minor celestial orbit, one again practices the major celestial orbit, and the task is accomplished. The above three explanations all pertain to theoretical discourse. In actual practice, once the state of great quiescence is attained, externally the heavens and earth unite, and internally Kan and Li merge. The minor and major celestial orbits proceed simultaneously. As it is said: \"The inner elixir returns in harmony with the outer elixir; when the inner is open, the outer must also be open.\"\n\nMaster Cui’s *Mirror for Compounding the Elixir* simply states: \"The prenatal qi, the postnatal qi—those who attain it are ever as if intoxicated.\" It does not distinguish between minor and major (celestial orbits), yet in truth, both minor and major celestial orbits are already encompassed within, making it most concise. The adept should take heed.\n\nThe secret formula states: \"When heart and breath wondrously unite, embrace virtue and warm harmony. The true qi steams and suffuses, nurturing nature and prolonging life, reestablishing the embryo, and recreating the cosmos. In the mysterious tradition of cultivation and realization, this alone is supreme.\"\n\n**38. Passing the Major Celestial Orbit’s Barriers**\n\nOnce the adept completes the initial work of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\" and receives the cessation of firing instruction, the elixir may be formed. After the elixir is formed and signs manifest, one must nurture the elixir to fullness and then practice the major celestial orbit. This major celestial orbit is distinguished from the initial minor celestial orbit. The initial stage involves returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, using pure yin to attract pure yang. At this juncture, the inner body has already become a Qian entity, and with one’s own Qian yang, one again attracts the Qian yang of the void, uniting the inner and outer layers of the prenatal to achieve the great returning elixir, called the major celestial orbit.\n\nThe practice fundamentally relies on the interdependence of heart and breath, yet at this stage, three to five breaths suffice to attain profound quiescence. In this quiescence, the void is without self, forgetting things, thoughts, the heart, the environment, the internal, and the external. One’s own prenatal void communicates with the void of heaven and earth, allowing natural operation. At the moment of extreme vacuity, the body’s prenatal pure yang true qi naturally surges through the barriers to the crown, ascending along the Governor Vessel—what Ancestor Lü called \"white clouds ascending to the celestial gate.\" It then descends along the Conception Vessel—what Ancestor Lü called \"sweet dew sprinkling Mount Sumeru.\"\n\nThis stage of practice also involves three types of firing, which have been orally transmitted among immortals since ancient times and are not recorded in texts. As *Awakening to Reality* states: \"The契 and论, the scriptures and songs, expound the truth, yet do not commit the firing to writing. To know the oral secrets that penetrate the mysteries, one must discuss them carefully with immortals.\"\n\nAfter practicing for a suitable period, when the lower abdomen feels boiling and the great medicine is about to sprout, there is a seven-day process for passing the major celestial orbit. At this time, the adept must have two or three fellow practitioners as external guardians, retreating to a secluded and tranquil place where no roosters or dogs can be heard. With the external guardians attending to food and drink, keeping watch day and night outside the adept’s body, and remaining vigilant, the adept’s mindfulness remains luminous. When demonic states appear, the adept will not be led astray or encounter mishaps—this is the most crucial point. If external conditions are favorable, one may proceed day and night to complete this great return.\n\nAfter several days of practice, the great medicine naturally arises. This great medicine also has its signs. A poem in *Awakening to Reality* says: \"The divine work of firing is not confined to a single day; a sun-like wheel emerges from the deep pool.\" Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Songs* states: \"All myriad phenomena are not of its kind; a single red light is the ultimate truth. This red light is the spring’s essence, within which, like dust in a bright window, a speck of prenatal medicine hangs—distant as a grape, near as gold.\" Another *Daoist Song of the Rootless Tree* says: \"The rootless tree’s flowers are bright red; pluck all the red flowers, and the tree is empty.\" Master Hanxu’s commentary notes: \"Red is the symbolic form of the great medicine. The immortal master’s *Daoist Songs* and *Song of the Rootless Tree* are both essential works; from them, one can understand this.\" It further states: \"When the red light appears, the flowers are bright red. Once the red flower is obtained, the true medicine is secured. Apart from this red flower, there is no medicine to gather.\" These can be referenced.\n\nAfter the great medicine arises, it also ascends along the Governor Vessel and descends along the Conception Vessel. However, its ascent is extremely slow, requiring several days of work.",
      "overlap_context": "nd major returns. The minor celestial orbit is used in returning from the postnatal to the primordial; the major celestial orbit is used when returning from the primordial to that which precedes the primordial. Though both are quiescence and the same circulation of qi, the depth of practice differs, as do the effects upon the physical body. The minor celestial orbit can only restore hair; the major celestial orbit can restore teeth, blood, even bones, marrow, and pupils, making one entirely new.",

      "translated_text": "Within these several days, the physical body endures the most unbearable trials, beset by layer upon layer of demonic illusions—all conjured by the discriminating mind. One must urgently employ the contemplation of true emptiness to sweep them away. Only after the great medicine completes one full cycle through the Conception and Governor Vessels does this perilous barrier pass safely. The residual yin of the physical body is then swept clean without remainder, forging an indestructible vajra-body. Thereafter, one need only nurture the embryo in meditative absorption, and the spirit may depart at will.\n\nFor those of superior skill, this great cycle and passage of the barrier may be accomplished within six or seven days after the great medicine arises; those of lesser skill may require eight or nine days. The Master said: \"To achieve ascension, one must reverse the body within seven days. Beyond seven days, one may only attain liberation through the corpse or seated transformation—ascension becomes impossible.\" The Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: \"In all firing times, only this great cycle presents such grave danger. The alchemist must prevail in a single battle, and all under heaven will be settled.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of Three Peaks, in his *Discourse on the Verification of Return*, provides the most detailed account of this great cycle and passage of the barrier. He says:\n\n\"To refine this great elixir of dragon and tiger, one must seek seclusion where no cock crows nor dog barks, and where only trusted fellow cultivators are present—no idle persons may approach, lest the primordial spirit be startled and scattered. Previously, I spoke of harmonizing with the world; now, I speak of seclusion. Tempering the self amid the dust, nurturing it in the mountains—this is the moment to enter the chamber and commence the work. To transcend the mundane and enter sagehood is no trifling matter. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, free from all cares, utterly unattached, cutting all ties as with a single blade, forever a stranger to the world, without a trace of regret.\n\nHold emptiness to refine the spirit; guard the void to refine the nature. The five viscera, sinews, bones, qi, and blood of the entire body all transform into azure qi. With single-minded devotion, train the spirit to purity, shaping it to command. As stars revolve and the Dipper turns, it obeys the heart’s every intent, nourished until the body bears no wrinkles, like a spider’s form. When the seven orifices radiate light, shining day and night, and the body becomes as the Great Void—only then is the proper time to seek the Dao of immortality.\n\nThis verification comes when qi is full and spirit complete, when dharma-wealth is vast. Only then may one refine the great elixir, and only then is one truly called an alchemist. When the work is accomplished, the time arrives of its own accord. The seven orifices shine, the three yangs flourish, and the spirit-sword takes form. Seizing the moment when water flows and wind follows, one ignites the fire—thunder roars and lightning flashes—to seize the celestial mechanism. With hands set to work, one captures the true lead beyond the body, marrying the dragon to the tiger, driving the tiger to the dragon.\n\nIf one can gather and cluster without missing the timing, one suddenly draws up the gold from the sea-bottom, opens the spine’s pass, ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, and descends into the Crystal Palace, where it unites with the wood-mercury. In less than half a moment, the clustering is complete, and true fire surges into the four limbs. The entire body’s flesh and bones feel as if scorched by fire or sliced by a blade—most difficult to endure. Even the staunchest hero, at this point, has not a shred of control. One must guard against danger, bathe body and mind, and achieve the harmony of water and fire.\n\nIn an instant, the whole body crackles like roasting beans, bursting open all at once. The body’s qi and blood all coalesce into speaking forms, clamoring in a heap upon the body. Beneath the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the Elixir Well, the right the Stone Spring—this is precisely the Lianquan point, which opens along with the bone meridians. Kidney water surges upward like an external spring, impossible to swallow entirely, its flavor most extraordinary, unlike sugar or honey.\n\nYet the supreme marvel occurs at the moment of tending the furnace and setting hands to work: the earth is about to yield its golden lotus, and heaven hangs its precious dew. Suddenly, a single drop of true mercury descends, piercing the heart with icy clarity. One immediately directs a spark of spirit-fire to follow, clustering it within the Palace of Union. All at once, it resounds like a thousand drums in battle, roars like ten thousand thunders—yet this is merely the transformation of the body’s hundred meridians and qi-blood. Do not be alarmed. One must tread the steps of the Dipper, wield the sword, grasp the seal, and hold the mudra. Here lies the most treacherous point: three revolutions, nine turns, subduing generals and summoning marshals.\n\nIn this vigilance, amidst the void, one may witness dragons and tigers coupling, heaven and earth in harmony, sun and moon exchanging palaces, or the assembly of immortals and buddhas. When the work reaches this stage and all visions manifest, one must not acknowledge them, lest one be ensnared by external demons. Recognizing only the primordial spirit, mercury and lead unite. After three days, the great medicine is born. These three days are the hardest to endure: the entire world becomes a realm of demonic illusions, with wailing spirits on all sides and baleful vapors in every direction. This is precisely the great opening of the barrier. At this juncture, nine out of ten are terrified to death. The heart must harbor no fear, for though one has transformed into a spirit, it remains a yin-spirit. Yin-spirits are most cunning, capable of myriad transformations to inflict harm—they will not submit willingly.\n\nAn ancient adept said it well: ‘Only when you master the six penetrations can you escape birth and death; if you do not master the six penetrations, do not dream of attaining the Dao.’ After thirty hours—two and a half days—of primordial chaos, qi interpenetrates qi, filling to the utmost. Suddenly, a radiant solar pearl bursts forth, lively and free, leaping from its husk into the mouth. A hundred thousand dragon-spirits are struck with awe. This is the primordial yang elixir entering the mouth—only then does one know that one’s fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nAn ancient immortal said: ‘Only after this great death does one truly live.’ Another said: ‘Prevail in a single battle, and all under heaven is settled.’\"",

      "translated_text": "This is precisely such a stage.”\n\nThe above is Master Sanfeng’s account of the great celestial cycle’s passage through the barriers—among ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only this one reveals the secret. It is truly the guiding compass of esoteric cultivation and the mirror of the return to the origin. I have heard my late master say that among the disciples of Master Ke, there was one named Sun Jifu who personally underwent this seven-day practice. All the phenomena of his bodily transformations matched exactly what Master Sanfeng described: “like fire scorching and blades slicing, like beans crackling in a wok, all bursting open at once.” This too is absolutely true. Without steadfast concentration to maintain control, one would be utterly lost at this juncture.\n\nIt is further said that among demonic obstacles, the most difficult to dispel is the demon of form. Unless one’s cultivation of inner refinement has been profound in ordinary times, one will often lose control at this point, overwhelmed by yin forces, leading to grave danger—far beyond mere regression in practice. Therefore, this phase of cultivation must not be hastily undertaken by those lacking deep concentration. Later learners cannot afford to proceed without caution.\n\n39. **Transcending the Womb and Spiritual Transformation**\nMy late master said: “Transcending the womb means shedding the mortal breath of ordinary respiration; spiritual transformation means dissolving the acquired consciousness of the postnatal mind.” His words are concise and precise, beyond further elaboration—a true guiding compass for the cultivation of the esoteric tradition.\n\nAfter completing the great celestial cycle, the adept nurtures the Dao-embryo in quiescence, single-mindedly abiding in forgetfulness, entering the gate of great stillness and perfect illumination. The breath at the mouth and nose ceases entirely, replaced by the internal circulation of primordial harmony. After six or seven months, even eating and sleeping fall away, and throughout the twelve hours of the day, one remains in the state of great concentration. After eight or nine months of further refinement, the six pulses all still, and the primordial spirit shines alone. The Dao-embryo reaches completion, attaining the ultimate of true emptiness and selflessness. The dharma-body can then separate from the physical form.\n\nAs Ancestor Lü said: “After the cold clouds disperse, the waning moon remains; when the winter snow arrives, it turns toward the great void.” This refers precisely to this stage. The “winter snow” signifies the vision of six-petaled flakes falling in concentration—a sign of the spirit’s emergence.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: “Formed and emerged from the womb, one becomes a true child of the Buddha.” This also indicates the maturity of samādhi, the attainment of a body born of insight, and the meaning of transcendence.\n\nIn essence, the cessation of breath marks the great stillness of concentration, the starting point of transcending the womb and spiritual transformation. The complete dissolution of the consciousness-skandha signifies its perfection.\n\nAfter transcending the womb, one embraces the primordial and guards the One, awaiting the re-conception of the “embryonic grandson” and the unhindered division of the body—this is called “nurturing the embryonic infant,” also known as “nursing.” There is yet further work above this: using the true fire of samādhi to forge the mortal frame. Over time, form merges with the Dao, wondrously uniting with the great emptiness. Not only does the mortal body dissolve into emptiness, but even the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind at their most fundamental level melt away into the ocean of inherent nature.\n\nAs Master Sanfeng said: “Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial cycle, forging true emptiness to return to the great nothingness.” This is precisely what he meant.\n\n40. **Shattering the Void**\nSomeone asked: “The sinking of the great earth and the shattering of the void are the great awakening realms of the Chan school. How can the esoteric tradition possess such a state?”\n\nMaster Xuanjing replied: “Not so. Did Zhuangzi not say: ‘The Gate of Heaven is non-being. Yet within this non-being, there is a non-being of non-being—it is here that the sage abides.’? Now, ‘non-being’ is the void. To strike down even this state of non-being—is this not the meaning of shattering the void? When the void is shattered, the attachment to the void (for if one clings to the void, the void itself becomes an object) is extinguished, and one suddenly perceives the inherent nature.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: ‘When even one among you truly returns to the origin, this ten-directional void will entirely collapse.’ The *Liezi*’s ‘King Mu of Zhou’ chapter speaks of ‘the transforming man moving him, and the king seeming to fall into the void’—is this not akin to the *Śūraṅgama*’s ‘collapse of the void’? The realizations of immortals and buddhas align perfectly—what difference is there?\n\nThus, the True Man of Purple Yang said: ‘Parting with the child who rides the crane away, the void shatters to reveal the whole body.’ Master Yuchan said: ‘Joyous, joyous, truly joyous—the void shatters like autumn’s finest down.’ Li Daochun said: ‘Shattering the void to attain great awakening.’ Fan Yunqiao said: ‘Shattering the void, one is utterly at ease.’ Master Sanfeng said: ‘Breaking the void is no trifling matter—it gathers the six directions into a single millet grain.’ And again: ‘As virtue ascends and spirit advances, the void shatters beside the dharma-body.’ Chen Cuixu said: ‘Returning to the origin to restore true emptiness, shattering the void to accomplish the task.’ This is precisely the final step of esoteric cultivation: transcending both emptiness and existence, leaving all dependence behind. Only then does the pure dharma-body pervade the dharma-realm, turning the great Dharma wheel in every land and every mote of dust, entering the ocean of the wondrous awakening fruit, perfectly fused and all-encompassing—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao.”\n\n41. **Guarding Against Danger and Considering Risks**\nThe ancient sage said: “Value great calamity as you do your own body.” And again: “The reason I have great calamity is because I have a body. If I had no body, what calamity could I have?” This means that sentient beings, due to attachment to the body, generate the view of a self, giving rise to all manner of craving and clinging. If one can truly empty this illusory existence, forget the physical form, and relinquish the senses of ear and eye, then one can enter the Dao anywhere—what calamity could there be? “No body” means forgetting the form.\n\nIn the alchemical tradition, guarding against danger and considering risks arise because practitioners cannot forget the form, constantly clinging and lingering, unwilling to let go, thereby inviting all manner of dangers. For instance, during the refinement of essence into qi, if the adept, at the moment of yang’s arising, clings even slightly to the body, desire stirs, and the primordial true yang instantly transforms into postnatal turbid substance, risking the immediate loss of essence.",

A hundred thousand dragon-spirits are struck with awe. This is the primordial yang elixir entering the mouth—only then does one know that one’s fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nAn ancient immortal said: ‘Only after this great death does one truly live.’ Another said: ‘Prevail in a single battle, and all under heaven is settled.’\"",

      "translated_text": "When refining qi to transform into spirit, if one clings even slightly to the body, the already stabilized qi may become unsettled, risking the peril of the elixir’s escape. When refining spirit to return to emptiness, if the slightest attachment to emotion remains, one cannot revert to the Great Void and enter the gate of perfect penetration. Thus, the subtleties of the supreme Dao demand that even the faintest lingering attachment be relinquished—nothing less suffices. The view of the body must especially be cast aside. Tanzi’s *Book of Transformations* sets forth the three barriers of practice, taking the forgetting of form as the entry point, which may serve as a reference.\n\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records that the Dark Emperor ascended from beneath the Sheer Cliff of Wudang Mountain, carrying yet deeper significance. The *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: “The noble person who attains it preserves the body; the petty person who attains it treats life lightly.” This distinction between noble and petty lies precisely in whether one can forget the form or not. Those who cannot forget the form face danger at every step; those who leave the body behind walk in safety at every step. For the study of the primordial, any stirring of the mind or arising of thought already deviates from the Great Dao—how much more so clinging to the body?\n\nFormerly, my master instructed me: “Externally, do not cling to the colored body; internally, do not arise a single thought.” These two lines truly encapsulate the essential principles of forgetting the form and relinquishing the body, serving as a guide to guarding against danger and considering risks.\n\n---\n**Appendix**\nLetter from Master Wang to Meng Haoyuan of Tianjin:\n\nHaoyuan, my worthy friend,\n\nI have received your previous letter mentioning the arising of external yang, which I regard with indifference. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir values the primordial above all, not the postnatal. Even reaching the stage of yang’s arising may be considered a minor verification of progress.\n\nYour letter of the nineteenth brings both joy and vexation. Why joy? You wrote: “The qi settles into stillness, and breathing ceases.” This is a great verification of the primordial. Know that the gathering of the true seed, the advancing of yang fire, the retreating of yin tally, the Mao-You ablutions, and the minor celestial orbit—every verification and effect is contained within the four words “breathing ceases.” Without rigorous effort, one could never attain this state. This verification is truly cause for joy.\n\nEarlier, you asked about verifications and phenomena—this is the true phenomenon, the true verification.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures all teach one to guard against danger. To guard against danger is precisely to teach one to guard against attachment to the physical body. If one is not attached to the physical body, what danger could there be? Laozi said: “Set the body aside and the body is cultivated; forget the form and the form endures.” He also said: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble could I have?” Ponder this thrice.\n\nIn refining the Golden Elixir, can one remain ignorant of the need to depart from the physical body? Furthermore, upon grasping this truth, with daily practice, let heart and breath interdepend—always beyond the body—without the slightest notion or awareness of the physical form. Once stillness is attained and breath ceases, this is what the alchemical classics call “entering samadhi.” At this moment of entry, one must forget things, forget form, be without self or other—like a living corpse. The longer the samadhi endures, the swifter the effects manifest.\n\nShould yang arise, swiftly return to the interdependence of heart and breath beyond the body. Upon re-entering stillness, proceed as before. If the physical body experiences sensations like being sliced by a blade, drilled into, throbbing, or itching, remain ever the “living corpse.” With not a single thought stirring, leakage naturally ceases. Practice thus for another week or two and observe the results.\n\nAs for the question of firing times, so long as one is not attached to the physical body, all will align.

Upon receiving this letter, reply at once: how many breaths until you enter profound obscurity and trance? How many breaths until you attain great samadhi? Most crucial are those four words—*\"numbness throughout the body\"*—is this numbness in the interdependence of heart-mind and breath? Is it in profound obscurity and trance? Is it during great samadhi? And how many minutes does the numbness last? Write this clearly and plainly; only then will it be a true report. I will then have an anchor and can discern the state of your practice. Empty words about the physical form, stale phrases on paper—omit them entirely.\n\nIn sum, the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir comprises three stages of practice: first, refining essence to transform it into qi; second, refining qi to transform it into spirit; and third, refining spirit to return to emptiness. All are the interdependence of heart-mind and breath. Ah! When the interdependence of heart-mind and breath is complete, the alchemical path is complete. The transformations at each step are the firing times, the very essence of those thousand names and ten thousand appellations.\n\nI now send you a copy of *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*.

      "translated_text": "The day before yesterday, I received your express letter, and my father was greatly displeased upon reading the few lines you appended at the end. Yesterday, he prostrated himself at his desk to draft a swift reply. Today, another express letter arrived, and my father again found it unacceptable. He immediately instructed me to send you this express letter, urging you to temporarily suspend your practice—this is of the utmost importance. For at this stage of your practice, you must not, even in the slightest, attach to the physical body. You must understand that all the primordial pure *qi* that comes to your body will, if even a trace clings to the physical form, instantly transform into postnatal turbid *qi*, which is harmful rather than beneficial.\n\nMy father says: \"Your error stems from the two words 'experimentation' in your previous letter. The distinction between the primordial and the postnatal is a matter of the most minute yet vast divergence—you must pay the closest attention. In all worldly affairs, where there is benefit, there is also harm. At this stage of practice, you must clearly distinguish between the primordial and the postnatal, strictly adhere to your master’s instructions, and not rely on your own judgment in the slightest. Upon receiving this letter, you must suspend your practice at once and await my father’s further instructions before resuming. My father says he too once experienced such phenomena but later corrected himself. The only regret is that we cannot speak face-to-face, for then the error could be rectified in an instant.\"\n\n*(The following is omitted.)*\nRespectfully submitted by your younger brother, Wang Yuchuan\nThirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month\n\n---\n\n**Excerpt from the Master’s Letter**\n\nMy esteemed brother Haoquan, as if in your presence,\n\nI must inform you of two matters that require immediate correction. If you do not rectify them swiftly, there is no need to pursue the Dao at all.\n\nThe first is clinging to the written words of the ancients as the Dao.\nThe second is clinging to the physical body as the Dao.\n\nIn my previous letters, I repeatedly expounded upon the subtle principles of the primordial and postnatal, the Dharma-body and the physical form. Pray reflect deeply: if you cannot transcend the body, how can the body be cultivated? If you cannot forget the form, how can the form endure?\n\nAh! Can you afford to ignore the words of Laozi?\n\nI instructed you to study *The Unitary Principle*, yet you refuse to read it—what is the reason for this?\n\nThe Fifth Southern Patriarch said:\n*\"Lead and mercury are not to be sought within the body;\nThe dragon and tiger must be sought beyond the mind.\"*\n\nAh! Since lead, mercury, dragon, and tiger are not found within the body, you must realize that the crucial step lies *outside* the body. If you would but set aside the practice of questioning written words and instead study *The Unitary Principle*, all would become clear.\n\nFurthermore, Wang Chongyang, the direct disciple of the Patriarchs Zhong and Lü and the foremost of the Northern True Ones, composed *The Complete Reality Collection*, using the three words \"living dead man\" as a guide. He wrote hundreds of poems; I have copied ten for you to contemplate deeply:\n\n1.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nBurying the four illusions is the cause.\nSleeping soundly in the tomb, so carefree,\nBreaking through emptiness, trampling the dust to fragments.\n\n2.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nNeither speaking of karma nor its fruits.\nAt ease in the tomb, as I will it,\nAttaining freedom beyond the six realms of dust.\n\n3.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nToday I speak to you of the great cause.\nDying alone in the tomb is true joy,\nSharing a pillow and coffin, all turns to dust.\n\n4.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nKnow the causes of fire, wind, earth, and water.\nDaily in the tomb, consuming the true elixir,\nExchanging the mortal frame for a speck of dust.\n\n5.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nFinding death within life is the true cause.\nIn the tomb, tranquil and utterly still,\nCut off from the mundane world’s dust.\n\n6.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nThe harm of wind is my former cause.\nIn the tomb, this true message,\nA white lotus rising from water, untouched by dust.\n\n7.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nKnow that the five grains sustain the body’s cause.\nIn the tomb, perceiving the principle of true suchness,\nEating earth, consuming mud, nourished by filth and dust.\n\n8.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nSleeping by day, resting by night, knowing the cause.\nIn the tomb, a true youth,\nLaughing at the clod of earth amidst the dust.\n\n9.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nWithin emptiness, emptiness is the cause of emptiness.\nIn the tomb, the ever-present scene of true emptiness,\nAwakening to emptiness, no longer becoming dust.\n\n10.\nLiving dead man, ah, living dead man,\nAsking me about the pearls and jade of the living—what is the cause?\nThe tomb’s realm is the true family estate,\nYet in the end, all must face transformation into dust.\n\nMost strangely, in your letters over the past month or two, you have repeatedly asked me for phenomena, for verification, for clarity. Let me tell you again: the Way of the Golden Elixir was called \"the study of chaos\" in high antiquity. For chaos is the state before the separation of heaven and earth. By the end of the Zhou dynasty, Laozi said: \"I know not its name; I style it the Dao.\" Thus, it was also called \"the study of the Dao.\" The word \"style\" denotes that which is without form. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the various perfected ones wrote books teaching people to learn from the dead.\n\nI ask you: can chaos have phenomena? Can it have verification? Can it be made clear?",

The transformations at each step are the firing times, the very essence of those thousand names and ten thousand appellations.\n\nI now send you a copy of *The Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*.

However, when my father saw them, he could not help but stamp his feet in dismay, exclaiming repeatedly, \"This will not do! How could such errors arise?\"\n\nHe instructed me to send this express letter at once, urging you to suspend your practice immediately and under no circumstances proceed further. Yet even now, I remain utterly perplexed and can only ask you again and again for clarification.\n\nAccording to what you have written, your progress in practice is truly rare—how then can the distinction between the prenatal and the postnatal still elude you? When your practice reaches the point where your entire body tingles and grows numb, and your ordinary breath settles—indeed, when even the breath seems to cease—if at that moment there remains the slightest attachment to the body or the faintest stirring of thought, the true yang of Heaven and Earth that you have gathered will instantly transform into postnatal turbid qi, causing great harm. Sweat, mucus, tears, and all forms of leakage arise precisely in that critical instant, born of the harm caused by a single thought clinging to the body. This is what it means to be unable to relinquish the body, unable to learn from the dead, unable to enter the state of primordial chaos. If you persist in this practice, you will surely court danger. Thus, I urge you to pause your efforts and study *The Unity of the Three Teachings* thoroughly.\n\nI offer you this analogy: Consider a man past fifty who has no heir. Each time he lies with his wife, he harbors the hope of conceiving a child, yet his wish remains unfulfilled. Meanwhile, those with many children often conceive without such intent, even while holding an infant in their arms.

      "translated_text": "\"In this lies a profound truth. For those who study the Dao, if even a single thread of attachment remains to the physical form, the primordial will invariably transform into the acquired. Not only will this bring no benefit, but it will cause great harm, distancing one from spontaneity. As my esteemed father has observed: Your practice has reached an excellent stage, yet it is regrettably hindered by attachment to the physical form. At this level of attainment, the firing times are exceedingly subtle, and it is essential to receive oral instruction from a teacher to truly grasp their meaning.\n\nWhen you last visited Shanghai, we spoke for only two or three days. Such subtle transformations in firing times were not yet discussed at that time, nor would discussing them have been of any use. For in the study of the Dao, one must reach a certain stage of practice before a teacher’s guidance can lead to sudden enlightenment. Thus, in my father’s letter, he advised that when a convenient opportunity arises next year, you should arrange to meet and converse for several days—this alone would allow you to achieve a comprehensive awakening. However, if requesting leave proves difficult, there is no need to rush; this is of utmost importance.\n\nMy father further noted: In each of your letters, you mention the exact hours you begin and end your practice—this is already a mistake. Practice is simply natural practice; if you fall asleep while practicing, it is simply natural sleep. To harbor the intention of ending practice beforehand is to revert to the acquired. There is no logic in waiting until after practice to sleep. The opening and closing of the eyes, like all else, should be left entirely to spontaneity. In short, any arising of thought is a return to the acquired, and any attachment to the physical form is perilous. You must take heed.\n\nI recently received another letter from you, which my father read and found deeply unsatisfactory. I have since asked him to annotate all the harmful attachments to the body in this letter, so that you may clearly understand. I am now sending it to you.\" *(Text continues.)*",

      "translated_text": "May the Dao bring you peace.\n\nYour disciple, Wang Yuchuan, bows respectfully.\nTwelfth month, twentieth day.\n\nTo my esteemed brother Haoquan,\n\nI have received your letter sent last month and have already given a brief reply, which I trust you have kindly reviewed. Now, I shall elaborate further on all matters below, and I hope you will take this into consideration.\n\nAt the very beginning of Daoist practice, the heart and breath must depend on each other. The breath entering and leaving through the nostrils should retain a slight awareness, placed externally—neither forgotten nor forced. If forgotten, spirit and qi scatter; if forced, attachment arises and fire is kindled. The practitioner must achieve a state of pure naturalness, where one’s spirit and qi are always united and placed externally. If sleep comes, simply allow it to occur naturally (even when asleep through heart-breath interdependence, the heart and breath remain interdependent). In this way, one’s spirit and qi (the postnatal yin and yang) are nurtured within external emptiness (the prenatal yin and yang). Is this not like two heavens and four yin-yang?\n\nOnce I have become emptiness, my heart’s light naturally shines downward, and kidney qi naturally ascends (in ordinary people, after the body is broken, heart fire burns upward while kidney water leaks downward). Thus, the postnatal yin and yang within my own body naturally unite without any need for my intervention. I need only hold fast to the fundamental principle of heart-breath interdependence placed externally (the union of heaven and humanity). Then, all progress and verification in my practice will arise naturally (the foundation of the ten thousand transformations). This is the state you have previously experienced.\n\nFurthermore, as heart-breath interdependence is practiced externally with increasing familiarity and purity, the breath in the nostrils may cease entirely, leading to stillness and samadhi. This is when the ordinary breath stops, and the true breath manifests, with every pore of the body engaged in respiration.\n\nInitially, one may feel soreness, numbness, and refreshment in the limbs (achieving this is already a circulation of the microcosmic orbit). After the body is broken, the injuries sustained vary from person to person. With prolonged practice, soreness, numbness, and joy will spread from the crown to the soles, permeating the entire body (achieving this is also a circulation of the microcosmic orbit, after which sweet fluids will naturally fill the mouth, to be swallowed at will—do not rush). At this stage, the practitioner must exercise extreme caution. If one clings to the physical form or entertains a single thought, grave harm may ensue.\n\nFor when I, through heart-breath interdependence, attain stillness, my own body’s heart light shines downward like the sun illuminating all things, fostering growth in boundless clarity—truly unstained by even a speck of dust. Only when I have become emptiness can I resonate with the true yin and yang of heaven and earth within my body (the sensations of soreness, numbness, and pulsation are the advancement of yang fire and the retreat of yin tally). If at this moment one clings to the physical form or deliberately tests the experience, the true yang of heaven and earth instantly transforms into postnatal turbid qi, leading to seminal leakage, nasal discharge, sweat, tears, or blockages causing illness. This is why my father, upon reading your letter, urgently instructed you to cease practice.\n\nIn cultivating the practice of heart-breath interdependence until the breath ceases, entering stillness and samadhi, and experiencing the joy of soreness, numbness, and pulsation throughout the body, one must not cling to the physical form in the slightest. The mind must remain fixed externally (the intention should be present yet absent). At this point, one must become like a corpse in the abyss—utterly abandoned.\n\nWhen internal and external reach extreme emptiness and profound stillness, if yang stirs below, I must swiftly return to external heart-breath interdependence (this must be done instantly, without hesitation). The yang will then subside. Originally, through heart-breath interdependence, I attained stillness externally (note: I was already in samadhi, without breath or awareness, but when yang arises, qi surges upward, making me aware of the breath). Having attained stillness externally, I forget all things and all concerns, existing without self or other, allowing everything to unfold naturally. Thus, prenatal and postnatal yin and yang each find their proper place.\n\nIn short, the Dao of heaven is natural, while human affairs are forced. The practitioner must follow naturalness at every step and must not employ the slightest postnatal intention. This is of utmost importance.\n\nMy father also says: In your letter, you wrote that when the breath ceases, nothing is under your control. This is excellent progress, aligning with the alchemical principle, *\"Let it take the lead while I remain the guest.\"* The only pity is that clinging to the physical form at this stage causes harm.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of breath signifies heart-breath interdependence (vigorous fire), while its absence signifies stillness (gentle fire). Note that interdependence must be placed externally, and stillness must be fixed externally. \"Externally\" refers to the space just beyond the nostrils.\n\nMy father also earnestly instructs you to temporarily suspend practice. Based on your previous letter, which mentioned *\"frequent pulsations throughout the body, with hot qi swirling around the kidney root in the lower abdomen,\"* this indicates that you previously tested the experience while clinging to the physical form, transforming the three treasures of prenatal essence, qi, and spirit into postnatal turbid essence, qi, and spirit, which now afflict you. You must now focus on the principle of *\"purity and stillness.\"* I enclose a copy of the *Tai Shang Qing Jing Jing* (Scripture of Supreme Purity and Stillness). Please read it thoroughly and practice accordingly. With prolonged adherence, the turbidity will naturally recede, after which you may resume practice (this is akin to someone suffering from wind-cold avoiding tonics, lest they cause obstruction).",
      "overlap_context": "e opening and closing of the eyes, like all else, should be left entirely to spontaneity. In short, any arising of thought is a return to the acquired, and any attachment to the physical form is perilous. You must take heed.\n\nI recently received another letter from you, which my father read and found deeply unsatisfactory. I have since asked him to annotate all the harmful attachments to the body in this letter, so that you may clearly understand. I am now sending it to you.\" *(Text continues.)*",

      "translated_text": "This passage requires your utmost attention. My late father also mentioned: I previously sent you a copy of Lu Qianxu’s *Annotated Exegesis of the Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal*, along with Chen Shangyang’s *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. If one wishes to distinguish between the precelestial and postcelestial, these texts explain it most clearly.\n\nQianxu’s exegesis states: “The supreme medicine of today refers to the precelestial—namely, original essence, original qi, and original spirit. Original spirit is the spirit of the primordial chaos before separation, not the spirit of daily thought and deliberation. Original qi is the qi of the great beginning at the dawn of creation, not the qi of mouth-and-nose breathing. Original essence is the most authentic essence, the essence that holds true constancy, not the essence of lustful intercourse.”\n\nShangyang’s *Great Essentials* further explains that the precelestial essence, qi, and spirit each have their names and dwelling places. Both texts elucidate this in their opening chapters—you would do well to study them in detail.\n\nAlas! How could one who has broken the body still possess these three supreme treasures? Once you recognize that the postcelestial physical form is but a foul skin-bag, you must understand that the body is a servant, a thief. If the student fails to awaken and clings to the physical form in pursuit of the Dao, it is like taking a servant as master without knowing it, or mistaking a thief for one’s own child without realizing it.\n\nFurthermore, in future practice, never harbor the notion of “beginning” or “ending” the work. If you can achieve even a few moments of heart-and-breath interdependence, falling asleep would be even better—this will help dissolve the body’s yin qi.\n\nI earnestly hope you will reflect deeply on all of the above. It is my sincerest prayer, though the vast distance between us prevents face-to-face discussion, which I deeply regret. Our detailed conversation must await a future meeting.",

      "translated_text": "By this postal convenience, I hereby send this reply (all the above was written in response to inquiries from my esteemed father).\n\nWith deepest reverence, I wish you Dao-an.\nYour younger brother, Wang Yuchuan, bows.\nThe nineteenth day of the first month of the fifth year.\n\nAll the above letters are selected from my humble compilation, *Supplementary Records of the Elixir Teachings of the Body-Realized Master*, to demonstrate the dangers of attachment to the body.\n\nAt the initial stage of refining essence into qi, the slightest attachment to the body will immediately give rise to sweating, nasal discharge, tears, seminal emission, and other transformations. If, during the stage of refining qi into spirit, one’s thoughts become attached to the body, the elixir will undoubtedly be lost. The deeper the practice, the more severe the harm caused by attachment to the body.\n\nHow wondrous are the words of Master Tan’s *Book of Transformation*: “Forget the form to nourish qi, forget qi to nourish spirit, forget spirit to nourish emptiness.” These three “forgets” penetrate the three barriers—perfect! Perfect indeed! Nothing surpasses this!\n\n**42. Harmonizing Radiance and Blending with Dust**\n\n\"Harmonizing radiance\" means concealing one’s traces and veiling one’s light, refraining from self-display. \"Blending with dust\" means humbly aligning with worldly customs, moving and acting in accord with others, without setting oneself apart.\n\nLaozi said: “Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, harmonize the light, blend with the dust—this is called profound sameness.” This virtue of profound sameness was esteemed by the Keeper of the Pillars and is also the family teaching of the Old Master. Thus, Master Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* echoes this idea in a quatrain:\n\n*In cultivation, blend with the world and harmonize your light,*\n*Round when round, square when square.*\n*Hidden or revealed, yielding or resisting—none can fathom,*\n*How could others discern your conduct and concealment?*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Preface to Awakening to Reality* states: “The great cultivator harmonizes radiance and blends with dust, sheathes brilliance and blunts sharpness, avoids harm and preserves the body. Dwelling hidden in the marketplace, clothed in coarse robes while holding jade within, adapting to square or round, their conduct and concealment are unfathomable.”\n\nMaster Yongming of the Chan school said: “Conceal your traces, veil your light, act in secret, and employ subtly.”\n\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* says: “The noble person harmonizes but does not drift.” And again: “The Way of the noble person is obscure yet ever more manifest.”\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: “A fine retreat brings steadfast good fortune.”\n\nThe sages of the Three Teachings all valued concealed conduct, warned against self-display, and did so not only to preserve themselves with wisdom but also to employ the wondrous function of skillful means for liberating beings.\n\n*The Liezi·Heavenly Portents* says: “Master Liezi lived in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk.” Is this not a model of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust?\n\nIn ancient times, the Old Ancestor served as the Keeper of the Pillars in Zhou, Master Guanyin was the magistrate of Hangu Pass, Ge Hong was the magistrate of Goulou, and Master Jingyang was the magistrate of Jingyang—these were true immortals who harmonized their radiance within officialdom. Junping told fortunes, Qi Nian herded sheep, Master Hu sold medicine, Master Cuixu mended barrels, and Sun Simiao practiced medicine—these were true immortals who harmonized their radiance through crafts.\n\nIn the past, my teacher, Master Tianzhi, traveled to Hangao and encountered Master Li Zuhanxu at the Eastern Sacred Mountain Temple in Xi’an. At the time, Master Li was concealing himself among fortune-tellers, mingling with the crowd of character analysts to divine fortunes for others. Master Tianzhi stayed at the inn of Brother Ke for over a year, never revealing his true nature, and was regarded by all as an ordinary paper merchant. All these are exemplars of profound sameness, the wondrous function of Master Hu’s “hidden virtue and subtle mechanism,” serving as models for later generations.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: “When the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten feet.” The onset of demonic obstacles is largely due to self-display inviting misfortune. Therefore, concealing one’s traces, veiling one’s light, and practicing in secret are essential conduct after attaining the elixir.\n\nThe subtlety of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust lies in appearing the same while functioning differently, hence “harmonizing but not drifting.” Not drifting means not being turned by any circumstance. Dwelling among different kinds yet not assimilating with them; dwelling amid sounds and sights yet not being stained by them; dwelling in honor yet not priding oneself on it. Though entering all dharmas, one is not bound by any—this is called appearing the same while functioning differently.\n\n*The Precious Mirror Samadhi of the Cave School* says: “Snow in a silver bowl, a heron hidden in the bright moon—though resembling, they are not the same; when blended, one knows where to abide.”\n\nMaster Caoshan Jiji established three kinds of “falling,” referring to “falling into resemblance” and “falling into following,” which precisely capture the profound subtlety of harmonizing radiance and blending with dust. Yet without penetrating the ultimate barrier, one cannot easily attain this realm.\n\n**Appendix: Master Wang’s Teachings**\n\nFurthermore, after the student attains the elixir, they become “one who has gained the One and is thus numinous,” possessing a foundation of eternal attainment. Even if misfortune strikes, their spirit has its own master, and their qi cannot be invaded or dispersed. They may reincarnate and seize another’s body to complete their work. However, as the student’s practice deepens, they must be ever more cautious in worldly affairs, for “when the Dao rises a foot, demons rise ten feet.” The path of the golden elixir most provokes the envy of beings. The ancient saying about “three encounters with heavenly punishment” is truly due to self-display inviting misfortune, not actual heavenly punishment.\n\nWhen, in the future, the practice reaches the stage of rejuvenation, all worldly affairs and human sentiments will gradually conclude, and one will retreat to a tranquil state. If confronted with worldly clamor, respond with feigned foolishness and deafness—this is the most wondrous method. As the elixir texts say: “Blend with the world and harmonize your light, adapting to square or round in response to circumstances.” This point is truly crucial and must be carefully heeded when the time comes.\n\n**43. The Timeline of Dao Cultivation**\n\nAs the ancients said: “Those who skillfully cultivate the Dao accomplish it in a thousand days.”",

      "translated_text": "“It is also said: ‘Three years of diligence, ten thousand kalpas of bliss.’ In the early Qing dynasty, a woman from Guangling practiced the Dao for three years and passed away in seated meditation, leaving behind a gatha that read:\n\n*In stillness, nothing stirs,\nRepeatedly toying with emptiness.\nWhen earth ages and heaven decays,\nAmid the flight of the hun and the loss of the po,\nA master opens the lineage of the Dao,\nYet no method awakens the deluded.\nSuddenly, emptiness shatters—\nThe evening sun remains red as ever.*\n\nAnother disciple of Lü Zu, Zhang Zhennu, left her household and secluded herself for cultivation. After just over two years, she achieved liberation through the corpse.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states: ‘It is like standing a pole to see its shadow, or calling into a valley to hear its echo’—truly no exaggeration. Among the disciples of Master Ke, there was one named Sun Jifu, nearly sixty years of age. Upon receiving his master’s transmission, he practiced day and night with unwavering diligence. In just three months, the foundation of his elixir was laid; after another six months, he reverted to a youthful body. From the initial commencement of practice to completing the Great Celestial Cycle, only nine months had passed. Thereafter, ten months of nurturing the embryo allowed him to attain the ‘mind-generated body,’ achieving effortless liberation. As for the final stage of returning to emptiness, it may take as little as two or three years, or as long as eight or nine, to reach the state of the original, empty essence.\n\nThus, with wholehearted devotion to the Dao, one may attain accomplishment in three years and perfect realization in nine. As recorded in *Marvelous Encounters in the Sea and Mountains* in *The Grass Hut’s Own Record*: ‘Two years after Master Zhong’s departure, I resided in the Zhongnan Mountains, diligently refining the Golden Elixir of the Nine Returns. After nine cycles, the work was complete, and in ten months, my spirit was whole.’ This shows that Lü Zu completed the Great Return and attained the perfection of the embryo within two years. Furthermore, *Records of Immortal Traces* states that Lü Zu, from the age of sixty-nine to seventy-three, completed the Great Dao of returning to emptiness. This further confirms that Lü Zu’s cultivation spanned only seven years.\n\n*Zhuangzi*’s ‘Parables’ records: ‘Yan Chengzi You said to Dongguo Zi Qi: “Since I heard your teachings, in one year I became rustic; in two, I followed; in three, I penetrated; in four, I harmonized with things; in five, they came to me; in six, spirits entered; in seven, heaven was accomplished; in eight, I knew neither death nor life; in nine, I attained the great mystery.”’ Liezi, too, described his own cultivation and realization, which took nine years to transform. Examining the ancients and verifying with recent evidence, those who cultivate the Dao with diligence may, within three to nine years, attain the supreme state of spirit.\n\nFor those burdened with demanding duties, the key lies in stealing moments of leisure amid busyness to regulate the spirit and breath. As the ancient worthies said: ‘Steal leisure amid busyness to refine the external medicine.’ This precisely conveys the essence. If daytime offers no opportunity for practice, one may cultivate during sleep at night. Fall asleep with mind and breath interdependent, and upon waking, resume the practice. Alternating between sleep and practice throughout the night brings the return of spring to the world, yielding no small benefit. This is the method of ‘using sleep to preserve the true,’ a path that follows in the footsteps of the immortal Chen Tuan of Huashan, and aligns with the sage Confucius’ wisdom of ‘entering rest at dusk.’ Truly, it is the sole cultivation method for those entangled in worldly affairs.\n\n**44. The Benefits of Learning the Dao**\n\nZhou Dunyi of the Song dynasty wrote in *The Comprehensive Book*: ‘In the realm of heaven and earth, the most revered is the Dao, the most noble is virtue, and the rarest is humanity. Among humans, the rarest is one who embodies the Dao and virtue.’ The Old Sage said: ‘Thus, though one may establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Dukes, even offering large jades preceded by teams of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and advancing in this Dao.’ Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva declared: ‘If one sits in stillness for a single moment, it surpasses building pagodas of the seven treasures as numerous as the Ganges’ sands. Though those pagodas will eventually crumble to dust, a single thought of stillness attains right awakening.’ Layman Pang said: ‘The world cherishes treasures, but I value a single instant. Gold in abundance disturbs the mind, while stillness reveals the true nature of suchness.’ He also said: ‘The supreme matter in the world is nothing stronger than cultivating the Dao. If one awakens to the principle of non-arising, the three realms naturally vanish.’ The Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: ‘Merely coveting profit, rank, and glory, one fails to notice the gradual withering of the body. I ask: though gold be piled as high as mountains, can impermanence be bought to not come?’\n\nAll glory, wealth, and honor vanish in an instant, belonging to the impermanent. Only the learning of the Dao transcends the forging of yin and yang, liberates from the suffering of the cycle of birth and death, and eternally enjoys the bliss of non-action and true purity—unmatched by any worldly fame or achievement. Thus, the ancients said: ‘Three years of diligence, ten thousand kalpas of bliss.’ Even for beginners, the practice brings serenity to body and mind, harmony to the breath, regulates life, reduces suffering, halts worldly toil, eradicates chronic ailments, saves on medical expenses, and cuts costs for clothing and food (when qi is full, one does not crave food; when qi is sufficient, one does not fear the cold). It yields the effects of peace, longevity, and carefree ease, with all meridians flowing smoothly and the body and mind light and vigorous. The self-enjoyment far surpasses that of ordinary people.\n\nIn recent times, as the world’s population grows and prices rise, life becomes increasingly arduous. Without turning toward emptiness to harness the primordial yang qi of the void and supplement material insufficiencies, enhancing human health, it is difficult to find an appropriate remedy. For while material supplements material, material will eventually be exhausted. Only the void is boundless, and true qi inexhaustible. As long as a single breath remains, one can regulate the breath and concentrate the spirit, returning externally and reverting internally. It requires only willingness, not expense. Thus, this Dao is accessible to all, regardless of poverty or wealth, wisdom or folly, age or youth. All may engage in cultivation according to their capacity, gaining benefits that regulate life’s deficiencies and reduce spiritual suffering. Truly, nothing is more fitting than this.”",

As the elixir texts say: “Blend with the world and harmonize your light, adapting to square or round in response to circumstances.” This point is truly crucial and must be carefully heeded when the time comes.\n\n**43. The Timeline of Dao Cultivation**\n\nAs the ancients said: “Those who skillfully cultivate the Dao accomplish it in a thousand days.”",

      "translated_text": "Minerals are the treasures of the earth; primordial yang qi is the treasure of heaven, the treasure of the void. Earth’s treasures are finite, while heaven’s treasures are infinite. Earth’s treasures can only nourish the physical body, whereas heaven’s treasures nourish both the physical body and the wisdom-life of the Dharma-body. Those Western scholars who study science and mining, developing the earth’s treasures—how can they compare to the ancient sages of the East, who studied the Dao and thus unlocked the far subtler treasures of the void? The Old Sage said: “Only the Dao is good at lending and completing.” What is this lending? It is the bestowal of the primordial One Qi. The master who so generously lends is none other than the void before one’s very eyes, near and effortless. If we can rest our breathing at the heart of the void, entering the state of profound obscurity, this master will naturally lend us the primordial One Qi. It makes the weak strong, the ordinary sagely, the foolish wise, the sick healed, the withered flourishing, the feeble robust, the blocked unobstructed, the cold clothed, and the hungry fed—fulfilling every wish. The method is utterly simple and easy; its effects are divinely swift. Even the foolish and unworthy can know and practice it—is this not a matter of resolving all with one stroke, universally and equally? True Man Sanfeng said: “When one nurtures spirit and qi, spirit becomes the master that gathers qi. Gather one part qi, and you gain one part treasure; gather ten parts qi, and you gain ten parts treasure. Qi is so precious that in the world, even a hundred taels of gold or jade cannot exchange for a single part.” Thus, the study of qi-transformation in the Mystery School has always unfolded before the seamless pagoda, woven within the cave of emptiness, dwelled in the palace of the Void King, and rested beneath the shadowless tree—gathering primordial yang and assembling the precelestial. Harnessing the true One Qi to defend and nourish body and mind, transforming mortal bones, dissolving the yin of consciousness, instantly ceasing worldly toil, transcending life and death, and forever avoiding the three calamities, it is the teaching that awakens the latent potential of the Chinese people. It can resolve present hardships and eternally preserve boundless ease—why would one not strive to practice it?\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into the Dao De Jing* says in verse:\nAt the hundred-fathom shoal, he casts his line alone;\nNo need to seek the ferry to the Peach Blossom Spring.\nWhen the dragon in the sea’s depths stirs to wake,\nA night of wind and thunder brings spring to the earth.\n\n**45.

      "translated_text": "“Has your skill truly reached such heights?” Cook Ding laid down his blade and replied: “What your servant delights in is the Dao—progress beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I follow the natural grain, cleave the great gaps, guide the blade through the great hollows, and rely on what is inherently so. I have never touched the tendons or ligaments, much less the great bones. A good cook changes his blade every year—he cuts. An ordinary cook changes it every month—he hacks. My blade has lasted nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. The joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness. With what has no thickness entering where there is space, there is ample room for the blade to play. Thus, after nineteen years, my blade remains as if newly whetted. Nevertheless, whenever I encounter a complex joint, I see the difficulty, grow cautious, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost subtlety—until the ox falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. Then I stand, blade in hand, look around, and savor the moment with full satisfaction before wiping the blade clean and putting it away.” Lord Wenhui said: “Excellent! From Cook Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life.”\n\nThis passage subtly illustrates the fire-timing of the celestial cycle. The ox is an analogy for the physical body, and the blade’s edge represents the razor-sharp union of heart and breath. At the outset of practice, one cannot yet attain emptiness and spontaneity; the sense of the body remains, and movement is hindered—hence, “all I saw was the ox itself.” Once skill is perfected, body and mind are both forgotten, and the physical body becomes empty—thus, “I no longer saw the whole ox.” The meridians and channels of the human body are often obstructed; when practice reaches great stillness, the external primordial true yang surges through, opening the hundred vessels, and the qi circulates, irrigating above and below. One must follow its natural movement without contrivance. If the true qi ascends along the Governor Vessel and encounters obstruction midway, one may gently employ the *xun* wind to stir it. “Move the blade with utmost subtlety, and the ox falls apart”—this is the original stillness maintained externally. Such is the subtlety of “cleaving the gaps and guiding through the hollows.” The lines “meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses halt while my spirit moves; I follow the natural grain” reveal that when fire-timing reaches extreme purity and spontaneity, nothing is directed by the self; all is governed by the primordial spirit—this is what is meant by “let it be the master while I am the guest.” The four characters “spirit meets, spirit moves” are most profound, for the true primordial state admits no contrivance. Even the slightest intentional arrangement would no longer be “spirit moving.” Thus, the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: “There is a natural true fire-timing,” and also: “Simply rest the spirit and breath, and follow what is natural.” The Dao of Heaven operates the sun and moon in emptiness; the method of the Elixir observes the Dao of Heaven and likewise operates in emptiness. Cook Ding merely used a blade without thickness to enter the spaces of the joints, causing the ox to fall apart like earth crumbling—this, too, is the subtlety of emptiness. Emptiness and spontaneity are the master keys of fire-timing. The Classic states: “The wonder of spontaneity lies in knowing, yet its source of wonder lies in unknowing.” Thus, knowing yet being without knowledge is the ultimate principle of spontaneity.\n\n**2. The Hunchback Catching Cicadas**\nThe *Attaining Life* chapter says: Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback (an old man with a bent back) catching cicadas as easily as if picking them up.

As for divers, they can handle a boat the first time they see one.’ I pressed him further, but he would not explain.

Though a thousand overturnings and reversals unfold before them, they do not enter their minds. Where could they find no leisure?”",

      "translated_text": "This passage reveals that the crucial fire-phase lies in the word \"forgetting\"—forgetting leads to transformation. Once transformed and in communion, it is as the *Book of Changes* says of the Kun hexagram: \"Without practice, there is nothing unprofitable,\" just as the diver (one who dwells at the water’s bottom) can steer a boat the first time he sees one. When mind and breath interdepend, one can cross the great sea of birth and death—this is the supreme Dharma-boat. To steer this boat, one must reach the state of mutual forgetting, only then entering the realm of transformation. When the forgetting of concentration reaches its extreme, responses and actions all abide in samadhi, yet this does not hinder handling affairs. Whether in concentration or not, one does not know; whether acting or not, nothing obstructs—just like the diver steering the boat.\n\nAh, how wondrous!\n\n---\n\nFour: *Ziqing Carves a Ju*\nThe \"Attaining Life\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: \"Ziqing carved wood into a *ju* (a musical instrument). When the *ju* was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked, ‘What technique did you use to make it?’ Ziqing replied, ‘I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Yet there is one thing...’\"",

As for divers who can handle a boat the first time they see one—it is because they see the depths as though they were dry land, and a capsized boat as no different from a cart rolling backward. Though a thousand overturnings and reversals unfold before them, they do not enter their minds. Where could they find no leisure?”",

      "translated_text": "When I prepare to carve a *ju*, I never dare expend my *qi*, but must fast to quiet my mind. After fasting for three days, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dare entertain thoughts of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forget that I possess four limbs and a physical form. At this time, I am no longer aware of the court or state; my skill becomes concentrated, and external distractions dissolve. Only then do I enter the mountain forests to observe the natural forms and structures of trees—perfect in their inherent nature. Only then does the *ju* appear before me; only then do I set my hand to it—otherwise, I would not proceed. Thus, it is by aligning the heavenly with the heavenly that the instrument seems to partake of the numinous. Is this not the reason?\"\n\nThis passage hinges on the fasting of the mind and sitting in forgetfulness. As inner cultivation deepens, external distractions dissipate; *qi* becomes abundant and spirit whole. In movement, it follows the course of heaven; in stillness, it abides in profound silence. Aligning with the natural rhythm without calculation or deliberation—this is what is meant by \"aligning the heavenly with the heavenly.\" In this way, one merges imperceptibly with the great transformation, far beyond the reach of thought and measure.\n\nFive: *Ji Sheng Raises Fighting Cocks*\nThe \"Attaining Life\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: Ji Shengzi was raising fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, \"Are the cocks ready?\" He replied, \"Not yet. They are still hollow and arrogant, relying on their *qi*.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Not yet. They still respond to shadows and movements.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Not yet. Their gaze is still fierce, and their *qi* remains excessive.\" After another ten days, the king asked again, and he replied, \"Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, they show no change.

May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?\"\nThe man replied: \"No, I have no Dao. I begin with my origins, grow with my nature, and complete with my destiny. I enter with the swirling waters and emerge with the rushing currents, following the Way of water without imposing my own will—this is how I tread it.\"\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with origins, growing with nature, and completing with destiny?\"\nThe man said: \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is my origin.

A hundred hooks and back—the horses’ strength could not endure, hence their failure. Yet this was not Dongye Ji’s fault; rather, it demonstrates that use must not be exhausted, for exhaustion leads to failure.\n\n8. Gongchui’s Turning Craft\nThe *Chapter on Attaining Life* states: Gongchui’s turning surpassed compass and square (盖 here means \"to exceed.\" It refers to his hands’ rotation alone, his skill surpassing the tools, reaching the pinnacle of precision). His fingers merged with the object, his mind unburdened by deliberation, so his spirit was unified and unshackled. Forget the feet, for the shoes fit perfectly; forget the waist, for the belt sits comfortably. To forget right and wrong is the mind’s ease; neither inwardly altered nor outwardly swayed is the ease of timely action. To begin with ease and never depart from it is the ease of forgetting ease.\n\nLu Fanghu said: *\"This speaks of the marvel of pure spontaneity. Observe how he discusses ‘merging’—this is what the sages call ‘following the heart’s desire without overstepping the bounds.’ Gongchui shaped vessels without compass or square, merely rotating the object by hand to form perfect circles. The mention of ‘square’ merely completes the phrase. At that moment, his fingers merged with the object, his mind entirely unengaged—hence the words: ‘not deliberating with the mind.’ Though he did not deliberate, his mind was nonetheless present, simply unified and unconstrained. Had his focus been divided even slightly, even mastery would not have sufficed to form the circle. In learning, nothing is more feared than a divided mind or an overactive one. A divided mind leads to distraction and lack of precision; an overactive mind clings to things and fails to merge. Only the unified and unshackled can enter the marvelous. In *Zhuangzi*, even the most refined passages, every word and phrase, conceal profound meaning.\"*\n\nI say: Gongchui’s firing process had entered the realm of transformation, yet it still drew strength from the word \"forgetting.\" The firing process of returning cinnabar is the same—only when one attains Gongchui’s spontaneity can one reach the wondrous realm of the primordial, entering divine transformation. This is what the ancients meant by: *\"With no intent toward Chan, there is nothing that is not Chan.\"*\n\n9. Liezi Practices Archery\nThe *Chapter on Tian Zifang* states: Lie Yukou shot for Bo Hunwu Ren, drawing the bow to its fullest and placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrows, and each successive shaft fitted into the nock of the previous one. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bo Hunwu Ren said: *\"This is the archery of archery, not the archery of non-archery. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread upon perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you shoot then?\"* Thereupon, Wu Ren climbed the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, stood at the edge of the hundred-fathom abyss, his back turned and hesitant, with two-tenths of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Yukou forward. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming to his heels. Bo Hunwu Ren said: *\"The perfected person gazes above into the azure sky, delves below into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your aim is already imperiled!\"*",

      "translated_text": "This chapter on *huohou* (firing times) demonstrates the stabilization of spirit in profound tranquility, where external phenomena do not intrude and both emotions and perceptions are forgotten. Only then can one gather the great elixir and perform the seven-day completion of the grand celestial cycle.\n\nWhen Liezi trembled in fear, it was evident that his human heart had not yet perished. The \"archery of non-archery\" is the forgetting of achievement. To enter the state of effortless operation—this is the highest level of *huohou*.\n\n**10. The Painter’s Unfettered Posture**\nThe *Tian Zifang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: The Lord of Song wished to have a painting made, and all the painters arrived. They received his bow, stood at attention, moistened their brushes, and ground their ink—half of them remained outside. One painter arrived late, strolling leisurely without haste. He received the bow but did not stand; instead, he went to his lodging. The lord sent someone to observe him, and there he was, stripped of his robes, sitting cross-legged and bare. The lord said: *\"This is the true painter.\"*\n\nThe commentary explains: His leisurely stroll without haste was walking meditation, what the Perfected One of Double Yang called: *\"Let your feet go wherever they will; let your spirit always follow the qi.\"* Sitting cross-legged and stripped of robes—this was also seated meditation. Calming the spirit and regulating the breath, he had no concern for painting, yet the painting was already complete. How wondrous!\n\nZhuangzi’s writings truly convey the Dao, and here they contain a distinct Chan mechanism—stillness, stillness, no need for words. The other painters, moistening brushes and grinding ink, were all entangled in the workings of the discriminating mind. Even if they produced a fine painting, it would be but a dead thing. Better to sit cross-legged, stripped of robes, concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath, utterly unmoving—a naturally living arhat. The intent precedes the painting; the body itself preaches the Dharma. No wonder the Lord of Song called him the *\"true painter.\"* This is also a veiled metaphor.\n\nThe above ten passages describe varying depths of *huohou*. What must be noted is that most contain the principle of *\"concealing the spirit and guarding the qi\"* and the practice of *\"preserving the spirit and nurturing the nature.\"* Gradually, when body and mind become unmoving and one forgets both self and environment, one enters the wondrous realm of spiritual transformation. Only then can one achieve perfect freedom and respond with effortless mastery.\n\n**46. The Secret of Subduing Demons**\nIn *Journey to the West*, among all the demonic beings, the Red Boy possesses the greatest divine powers and the strongest magical abilities—this represents the postnatal deviant fire. Later, the Bodhisattva Guanyin cast down three rings and subdued him. Though called three rings, there were in fact only two: above, *Qian* (Heaven), below, *Kun* (Earth), with the central emptiness as the third—a state where the heart and breath are placed externally, relying on true emptiness. Merely casting down these three rings subdues all demonic beings. Their immense efficacy can thus be imagined.\n\nWhenever postnatal impurities stir or heavenly demons arise, one need only externally unite heart and breath. When true emptiness is attained, all will be at peace. This *\"Samadhi of Subduing Demons through the Great Void\"* is the most transcendent method.\n\n**Excerpt from Master Wang’s Record (from the *Secret Record of Alchemical Instructions by the Body-Realized Mountain Man*):**\nIn *Journey to the West*, the Red Boy represents the postnatal deviant fire, the false yang on both sides of the *Li* trigram. The Black Wind Demon represents postnatal yin essence, the false yang on both sides of the *Kan* trigram. When these two wield their powers, they nearly kill Sun Wukong—how formidable! Without Guanyin’s single ring cast down, they could not be subdued. But once you enter the external emptiness, the Black Wind Demon naturally vanishes, and the Red Boy transforms into Sudhana, ceasing his mischief.\n\n**47. The Wondrous Realm of Harmonious Equilibrium**\nWhen the firing times of heaven and humanity align without error, various transformations arise in the physical body, which can be broadly summarized in the term *\"harmonious equilibrium.\"* As Master Cui’s *Mirror for Ingesting the Medicine* states: *\"The prenatal qi, the postnatal breath—those who attain them are ever as if intoxicated.\"* The *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *\"The pores rise like one just bathed; the bones and channels are as if in deep slumber; the spirit and essence unite like lovers in joy; the hun and po cling like mother and child.\"* This is one example of the realm of harmonious equilibrium.\n\nHowever, one must understand that as practice advances, the wondrous realm of harmonious equilibrium also changes accordingly. There is the harmonious equilibrium of the minor celestial cycle, the grand celestial cycle, the seven-day completion of the grand celestial cycle, and the harmonious equilibrium during the nurturing of the embryo—these cannot be generalized.\n\nFocusing on the minor celestial cycle: when the entire body is supremely soft and blissful, this transforms into a state of numbness throughout. Numbness is the profound realm of harmonious equilibrium, and there is an even deeper state beyond it. At this stage, one must verify it with great samadhi.\n\nWang Qiyun’s *Five Degrees of Harmonious Equilibrium* states: *\"Harmonious equilibrium relies entirely on fire to refine the qi, and its effects manifest in five degrees. After three to five years of unshaken stillness, one may suddenly feel a qi ascending to the heart, hearing the sounds of wind, rain, and thunder, with the four limbs and all channels flowing—this is the harmonious equilibrium of ministerial qi, not yet the true Dao. Or after three to five years, one may suddenly hear the sounds of fierce winds, thunderous roars, and war drums, rising to Kunlun and descending to the knees, tasting the five flavors, the tongue producing sweet fluids, the eyes radiating light, and the nose flowing with jade-like essence—this is the harmonious equilibrium of the bladder’s citizen qi. The adept advances further, and other effects appear. After another three to five years, one may again hear the sounds of wind, rain, and thunder, with the hot qi of the elixir field spiraling upward, gradually ascending. This qi travels from behind the kidneys to Caoxi, rising to Kunlun. Sweet fluids are again produced, ascending like ghee to anoint the crown, descending like ambrosia to sprinkle the heart. The eyes flash with lightning-like brilliance—this is the flying golden essence behind the elbows.\"*",

He beckoned Yukou forward. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming to his heels.

Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your aim is already imperiled!\"*",

      "translated_text": "The adept who proceeds to this stage and advances further will encounter yet other signs of progress. Should they dwell in stillness for three to five years, they may hear within the roar of thunder and the sound of tearing silk in the abdomen. The qi resides behind the kidneys, striking the Weilu acupoint, passing through the Jade Pillar Gate, piercing the Niwan Palace and the Kunlun summit. The sound resembles a fierce wind tearing at the earth, while the surging qi descends like a cold spring. This is the Mysterious Pearl descending into the Elixir Palace, where at times the azure sky appears, or moonlight, or white snow, arrayed in the void. Sometimes dragons and tigers intertwine in harmony, or the sun and moon exchange palaces. Though such transformations occur, the adept presses onward, and after another two or three years, new signs emerge, arising from the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Sovereign. The Supreme Unity is the northern Ren and Gui waters, ascending to the Niwan Palace and descending to the Yongquan point. Again, the ears hear the clash of a thousand battle drums and the rumble of ten thousand thunderclaps, like a fierce wind tearing at the earth—this is the great ocean’s release, a thorough ascent and descent, all ablaze with crimson. The fire of the celestial cycle ignites, and the entire body, from head to toe, aches as if the bones are shattered and the sinews pierced. The four limbs and hundred vessels flow without obstruction, the bones seeming to break apart. One may lose awareness for three to five days, reopening the primordial chaos to reestablish heaven and earth. This is the fire of the celestial cycle, the harmony of heaven and earth, the exchange of sun and moon palaces, the transformation of mulberry fields into vast seas. At this stage of practice, ascension is certain—this is the end returning to the beginning, the changing of bones and drawing out of sinews, the Great Harmony.\n\nMaster Qiyun’s discourse may be cross-referenced with Zhang Sanfeng’s *On the Verification of Returning*. The final stage he describes corresponds to the seven-day completion of the great celestial cycle, which Sanfeng elucidates in even greater detail, serving as the definitive guide for the return in the Mysterious School.\n\n---\n\n**48. The Wondrous Workings of Spontaneity**\n\n*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: \"Only with utmost sincerity does one follow spontaneity.\"\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: \"What spontaneity does is not the path of deceit or falsehood.\"\n*The Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: \"Thus the sage knows the Dao of spontaneity cannot be violated and thereby masters it.\"\n*The Scripture of Great Penetration* says: \"Suchness is spontaneous, boundless and without limit.\"\n*The Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"Heaven and earth move by their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called spontaneity. If they are made to know what they do not know, this too is called spontaneity. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, arises from what is not known.\"\n\nMaster Xuanjing says: \"Not knowing is the forgetting of the heart-mind. All worldly arts and skills, without the utmost application of the heart-mind, cannot attain wonder. The methods beyond the world, without the utmost forgetting of the heart-mind, cannot achieve transformation. Thus the Dao’s method lies in spontaneity—this is the wondrous function of forgetting mechanism, responding without intention, constantly functioning yet constantly absent, difficult to exhaust in words.\"\n\nWang Yiqing says: \"Spontaneity is that which nothing can make so, and nothing can make otherwise.\" Thus spontaneity is divine wonder. The divine is that which is divine without one knowing how it is so; the wondrous is that which is wondrous without one knowing how it is so. At its utmost, it cannot be described in words or fathomed by thought. One knows *that* it is so but not *why* it is so; one names *that* which is named but not *why* it is named—where then does the name of spontaneity reside?\n\nThe former master said: \"The scriptures state: The dual-cultivation practice lies entirely in the fire timing. Huo Yun says: The fire timing follows each stage, all depending on spontaneity. To know spontaneity is to know the twofold heaven and earth, the fourfold yin and yang—this too is spontaneous.\"\n\nMaster Qianxu says: \"Spontaneity has a deeper meaning. My teacher instructed me: To follow spontaneity is not to yield to it.\" I say: When a practitioner’s effort reaches the state of spontaneity, every movement and stillness perfectly aligns with the heart of heaven, allowing no room for the slightest contrivance. If one employs the heart-mind to arrange things, they depart far from spontaneity.\n\nSome may ask: The ancient sages said, \"The Dao models itself on spontaneity.\" Yet the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Pure awareness is luminous, neither caused nor conditioned, neither spontaneous nor non-spontaneous, neither non-spontaneous nor non-non-spontaneous, free from all affirmations and negations, free from all characteristics, free from all dharmas.\" This seems to contradict the ancient sages—how can they be reconciled?\n\nI answer: The *Śūraṅgama* refutes the spontaneity of external paths, which is yielding to spontaneity. The spontaneity of the ancient sages is following spontaneity. When attachments are broken, all dharmas are perfectly fused, all suchness is one continuum. The spoken causes and conditions and spontaneity do not depart from the essence and function of self-nature—what hindrance is there?\n\n---\n\n**49. The Essentials of Great Samādhi**\n\nGreat samādhi is the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, where external breathing ceases, and spirit and qi settle into stillness. After prolonged samādhi, body and heart-mind become utterly quiescent, forgetting form, forgetting appearance, forgetting things, forgetting concerns. At this time, the primordial true yang penetrates the physical body, cleansing, irrigating, steaming, and nourishing the constructive and defensive qi, permeating the skin and marrow without exception. It renews the old and transforms the coarse into the wondrous—this is called \"refining the form in true emptiness.\"\n\nThus, for every degree the body and heart-mind attain stillness, emptiness advances by one degree, and primordial true yang advances by one degree. If body and heart-mind attain ten degrees of emptiness, primordial true yang advances by ten degrees. This refinement of qi must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nFurthermore, for every degree the body and heart-mind attain emptiness, the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree. As the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree, the primordial spirit manifests by one degree, increasing brightness and dispelling darkness. When the consciousness-spirit is fully transformed, the primordial spirit is fully revealed.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"When the heart-mind dies, the spirit lives\"—this is the essential principle of refining the spirit, and it too must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nMoreover, when body and heart-mind attain the utmost emptiness and stillness, the form merges with the void, the six directions all become heart-mind, the six harmonies all become body. Pervading and embracing all, fusing without bound, one may manifest responsive transformations at will, with every thought instantly realized. One may simultaneously enter countless buddha-lands, displaying boundless spiritual powers—this is the final stage of \"returning to emptiness and merging with the Dao,\" and it too must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nThe essence of great samādhi is fully expounded in the *Zhuangzi*. As it states: \"Fish are born of water, humans are born of the Dao. Those born of water thrive by carving out ponds; those born of the Dao attain birth in samādhi without effort.\" It also says: \"When the cosmos is at peace and settled, celestial radiance arises.\" And: \"Abide in great samādhi.\" And: \"The spirit that arises from instability is not borne by the Dao.\" Thus, the marvel of attaining the Dao may be encompassed in the single word *samādhi*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Human World\" chapter states: \"Gazing upon that emptiness, the empty chamber generates brightness. Auspiciousness abides in stillness—if one does not abide, this is called sitting while galloping.\" The esoteric commentary explains: *Que* means emptiness. At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, when inner and outer are both void, at the cusp of midnight, between the waning and waxing moons, when all sounds are hushed—this is the time of \"gazing upon that emptiness.\" When the empty chamber generates brightness, the first yang returns, and the primordial qi arrives at the palace. *Zhi zhi* refers to great samādhi. To be constantly moving yet constantly still is most auspicious, like a bright mirror reflecting images—responding to things without attachment, illuminating yet still, stillness and illumination as one, movement and stillness undivided. Is this not \"auspiciousness abiding in stillness\"? If qi stirs while the spirit scatters, one cannot summon the primordial.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Sutra* states: \"Samādhi and harmony are like clear awareness.\" And: \"At the inception of samādhi, breath is unified; in great harmony, a thousandfold peace. In great samādhi, the true is complete; in wondrous practice, the numinous is communicated.\" The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"When samādhi reaches its peak, clarity arises; when clarity reaches its peak, awakening is fulfilled.\" These all describe the phenomenon of wisdom emerging from long samādhi and clarity arising from long stillness.\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* presents a pure and correct vision. Upon reading his poems, I find he repeatedly reveals the essentials of great samādhi, displaying a unique insight among alchemical texts. He writes:\n*\"When body and heart-mind attain stillness,\nCongeal the spirit and secure qi and essence.\nThe body at ease transcends the leaky,\nThe heart-mind still verifies the unborn.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When body and heart-mind are still, the mysterious teaching flows.\nEssence, qi, and spirit empty, naturally merge.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Refining mercury and smelting lead have no fixed time—\nThe adept must seek them within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Attaining the Dao was never difficult—\nThe work lies solely within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Medicinal substances are gathered only from the formless;\nThe great elixir is wholly forged within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Abiding in stillness, unmoving, one accords with the true constant.\nDissolving all yin, yang naturally returns.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The great elixir’s nine returns and seven reversals—\nThe adept must seek them within samādhi.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you can maintain samādhi at the proper time,\nYou will know that noon is the third watch.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When the tide rises, water overflows the banks;\nWhen the wind stills, the river’s heart is free of waves.\nNature still, emotions empty, the heart-mind unmoving—\nSitting without dullness or distraction, sleeping without demons.\"*\n\nObserve: the phrase *\"nature still, emotions empty\"* is the true culmination of great samādhi. When refinement reaches this point, no matter what transformations arise in the physical body, all remain utterly still, like the great void. At this stage of the firing process, one may be said to have entered the hall and ascended the chamber. Thus the *Yongjia Song of Realizing the Dao* states: *\"Even if an iron wheel spins atop your head, samādhi and wisdom remain perfectly bright, never lost.\"*\n\nLongmeizi, the true heir of Bai Ziqing, composed the *Poems on Verifying the Golden Elixir*. Lu Zuqianxu wrote a commentary to elucidate them, and the poems also reveal the essentials of stillness and samādhi, as in:\n*\"Only when stillness reaches its extreme does movement arise—\nThis is the boundless becoming bounded.\nThe primordial qi originally emerges from the void;\nThe two modes must be trusted to revolve within samādhi.\"*\n\nQianxu’s commentary states: \"Yuanduzi said: The primordial qi arises from the formless. Thus it is said: *The primordial qi originally emerges from the void.* Immortals steal this true mechanism—gathering it in movement, refining it in stillness. Thus the revolving of heaven and earth, the movement of sun and moon, all proceed from samādhi. The word *samādhi* is most pivotal; the beginning and end of alchemical attainment lie solely within it. If one is not settled at the outset, thoughts and circumstances will not fade, and one cannot properly approach the task of tending the furnace and gathering the medicine. If one is not settled at the end, the firing process will not be harmonized, and one cannot achieve the work of liberating the spirit and transforming the embryo. Thus it is said: *The two modes must be trusted to revolve within samādhi.*\"\n\nThe poem further states:\n*\"To discern the cauldron’s lead, one must settle within;\nWhen yang fire flees, it is spread below.\nWithout meeting a true master’s direct instruction,\nWhere will you resolve the mysterious pivot?\"*\n\nQianxu’s commentary explains: \"The qi of the medicinal substances in the cauldron is subtle. To discern it, one must unify the will, settle the thoughts, attain great samādhi of the six senses, and forget both circumstances and emotions. Only then can one gather it without error. When the yang fire arrives, one spreads it below to welcome it. This requires the true teachings of a true master to practice.\" Since the words of the Eastern School’s founding patriarch are thus, the Western School’s transmission, which takes *\"great samādhi and true emptiness\"* as the secret essentials of elixir-making, is all the more credible and attested.",
      "overlap_context": "n degrees of emptiness, primordial true yang advances by ten degrees. This refinement of qi must be founded upon great samādhi.\n\nFurthermore, for every degree the body and heart-mind attain emptiness, the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree. As the consciousness-spirit is transformed by one degree, the primordial spirit manifests by one degree, increasing brightness and dispelling darkness. When the consciousness-spirit is fully transformed, the primordial spirit is fully revealed.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Master Wang once said: \"The methods of the elixir all return to a single word—*ding* (定, samādhi/settling). This is what is called the Way of utmost simplicity and ease.\" Yet though this be so, to attain true *ding*, one must forget both body and mind, still all emotions and circumstances. Without a measure of bitter effort, how could *ding* be so easily spoken of?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter states: \"Guangyao asked Wu You, ‘Master, do you exist? Or do you not exist?’ Wu You did not respond. (These five characters are missing in the received text and have been supplied from the *Huainanzi* to complete the meaning.) Guangyao, unable to obtain an answer, observed Wu You’s appearance: it was profound and empty. He gazed at him all day but saw nothing, listened but heard nothing, grasped but could not seize him. Guangyao said, ‘This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain non-being from being, yet I cannot attain non-being from non-being. How could one reach this from non-existence?’\" This passage from the *Zhuangzi* depicts the state of *\"great samādhi and true emptiness\"* with divine subtlety. When one is asked and Wu You does not respond, and the practitioner abides in *ding*, even after seven days of completing the great celestial cycle of firing times, such phenomena may arise. Thus, Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Way* says: \"To apply effort in such leisurely stillness—how could it compare to calmly cultivating great *ding*?\"\n\n**Fifty. The Wondrous Function of Killing Life**\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: \"Those who kill life do not die; those who give life do not live.\" Master An of Lingyan said: \"One must know that within killing lies liberation, and within living hides the mechanism. Neither buddhas nor patriarchs can fathom it.\" Layman Pang said: \"To protect life, one must use killing; only when killing is complete can one dwell in peace. Grasping the meaning within, an iron boat floats upon the water.\" Pure Yang said: \"That which lives does not live; that which dies does not die. To kill life after it has arisen, and to learn death before dying—this is long life.\" A monk asked Caoshan: \"Is not a śramaṇa one who possesses great compassion?\" Caoshan replied: \"Yes.\" \"If the six thieves suddenly arrive, what then?\" Caoshan said: \"One must also possess great compassion.\" The monk asked: \"How does one possess great compassion?\" Caoshan said: \"With a single sword, sweep them all away.\" The monk asked: \"After they are swept away, what then?\" Caoshan said: \"Only then is harmony attained.\"\n\nLong ago, Chan Master Shigong, before leaving the household, entered the mountains to hunt. Passing by Master Mazu’s hermitage, Mazu asked him: \"Why not shoot yourself?\" The purport of \"shooting oneself\" is the secret purport of killing life. \"Those who kill life do not die\"—this is the wondrous function of the heart dying and the spirit living. Reviving after absolute cessation, attaining life within death—both Chan and Daoist schools are thus. In the Daoist school, when the heart and breath interdepend, this is the sword of wisdom. When the six thieves arrive, sever them in two with a single blade, leaving no residual attachment. Externally, when breath and qi attain great *ding*, and internally, when not a single thought arises in the center, with inner and outer purity and emptiness—this is the moment of \"harmony.\"\n\nWhenever practicing the work, if one becomes aware of any phenomenon in the body, swiftly turn outward to interdepend, without the slightest attachment—this is the wondrous secret of killing life. With prolonged practice, when one becomes aware of any phenomenon in the body, one will naturally and effortlessly depart from the physical form and settle outside, thus forever eliminating the maladies of seminal and qi leakage.\n\nThus, one who truly kills life can truly attain long life. This is the function of reversing the flow, entering the unshakable ground, transcending the ordinary to realize the real—what Chan calls \"cutting off the flow.\" When the flow of life and death is severed, is this not liberation? This is the wondrous realization of non-birth and the wondrous fruit of long life. Without the wondrous mechanism of cutting off the flow and killing life, how could one attain stillness?\n\nOne might object: \"You are a scholar of the Daoist school—how can you recklessly advocate killing life? Now you even teach others to kill life. What is the meaning of this?\" I reply: \"Previously, I spoke of killing life in the conventional sense—merely knowing how to slaughter living beings to nourish this physical form, which only increases karmic conditions and offers no benefit to the Way. This should be abandoned. Here, I speak of killing life by reversing the flow—emptying this physical form and heart, severing the flow of life-and-death thoughts, and emerging from the five skandhas. This is the work of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood. The difference between following the current and reversing it is as vast as heaven and earth—how can they be mentioned in the same breath?\"",

      "translated_text": "Should a beginner inquire, \"What method should one adopt to attain the state of 'killing to the utmost and dwelling in tranquility'?\" I would answer: \"At all hours of the day and night, whenever the slightest wandering thought, stray念, or desire arises, swiftly turn outward to unite mind and breath. During practice, if the slightest stirring of external yang, or sensations of softness, pleasure, numbness, or pulsation occur, the moment you become aware, immediately depart from the body and unite mind and breath externally. When this union becomes effortless, inner and outer naturally harmonize, the six thieves vanish, and body and mind become light and vigorous—this is the secret to 'killing to the utmost and dwelling in tranquility,' the essential principle of refining the self.\"\n\n51. The Profound Meaning of Thrift and Restraint\nThe ancient sage said: \"In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses thrift. Only through thrift can one return early; early return is called accumulating virtue. With accumulated virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome; with nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom one’s limits. When none can fathom one’s limits, one may possess the state. Having the mother of the state, one may endure long—this is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.\"\n\nHere, \"thrift\" does not mean stinginess or withholding, but rather not being swept away by things, the state of the six roots being free from leakage. Leakage is the meaning of \"dissipation.\" The eye, drawn by forms, is led astray; the ear, by sounds, is led astray; the nose, by fragrances, is led astray. Everywhere, one follows the flow of the six dusts, and with movement within, essence is shaken. When essence is exhausted and spirit departs, life follows—thus the ancient sage said: \"Were I to have even a little knowledge, in walking the great Dao, I would fear dissipation above all.\"\n\nNon-leakage is the meaning of \"thrift.\" When the six roots are firmly stabilized and do not follow the six dusts—sounds, forms, and the rest—spirit and qi settle and overflow, the Great Harmony fills and abounds, and brightness endures day and night—this is called \"early return.\" The Way of long life and enduring vision lies precisely here. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—\nClose and seal, do not let them open.\nThe true person hides in the deep abyss,\nFloating and wandering, guarding the compass within.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Depart from qi, receive the camp and guard,\nKan ceases to use hearing,\nDui unites without speech,\nRare words follow the primal chaos.\nWhen these three are secured,\nRelax the body in an empty chamber,\nEntrust the will to emptiness,\nTake no-thought as the constant.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Firmly seal their meetings,\nStrive to make them complete and strong.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Close and seal the Dui,\nFortify the numinous root,\nThe three lights sink into obscurity,\nWarmly nurture the child-pearl.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Can one be careless?\nThe first principle of governance\nIs to grasp the subtle and secret.\"*\nAll these are the workings of the word \"thrift.\" In sum, thrift is the wondrous principle of concentrating spirit and securing qi, the six roots firmly stabilized, not chasing after the six dusts. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Reverse the flow to perfect unity, the six functions cease.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"Be cautious within, close off without.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Guard against evil and preserve sincerity.\" *The Analects* says: \"Look not at what is contrary to ritual; listen not to what is contrary to ritual; speak not what is contrary to ritual; make no movement that is contrary to ritual.\" All these express the meaning of \"thrift.\" The Wondrous Orthodox Perfected One said: \"Within seeing and hearing, cut off seeing and hearing—this is called the great rest.\" This is the supreme secret of the word \"thrift,\" encompassing boundless wondrous meanings without remainder.\n\n52. Verification in the Dao of the Elixir\nVerification in the Dao of the Elixir may be divided into two aspects: first, verification in the physical body; second, verification in the Dharma-body. As for verification in the physical body, the patriarchs Zhengyang, Ziyang, Cuixu, Sanfeng, and Qiyun have spoken of it in detail. The *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Golden sand enters the five viscera,\nMist scatters like wind and rain,\nSteaming and reaching the four limbs,\nThe complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.\nWhite hair all turns black,\nFallen teeth return to their places.\nThe old man becomes a youth again,\nThe aged woman becomes a maiden.\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"Transforming the form to escape worldly calamities—this is called the Perfected Person.\"\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*\"After ten months of toil and hardship,\nGradually gathering, gradually congealing,\nNow the whole body is white blood,\nAnd the four limbs no longer know cold or heat.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"After a year of practice,\nThe six pulses cease, and qi returns to its root.\nA newborn infant dwells in the cinnabar field,\nIts form and appearance just like mine.\"*\n\nIn the *Four Hundred Words Preface* by Ziyang, it is written:\n*\"When cultivation reaches this stage, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, and the waves of the Grain Sea settle. The spine moves like a wheel, the four limbs are as steadfast as mountains, the pores feel as if just risen from a bath, and the bones and channels are as deeply relaxed as in sound sleep. The spirit is as joyful as a reunion of lovers, and the hun and po souls are as inseparable as mother and child—this is the true realm, not mere metaphor. Refined by method, it gathers without scattering; tempered by measure, it solidifies ever more firmly. The hun soul is stored, the po soul extinguished; essence congeals, spirit coagulates. With a single intent of harmonious balance, the skin and flesh become radiant and clear. Day by day, hour by hour, it gradually congeals and gathers, transforming the formless into form, coalescing into the Sacred Embryo. Once the embryo’s qi has congealed, the Infant manifests; the Mystic Pearl takes shape, and the Supreme Unity embraces the True.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Essential Mysteries* reveals various verifications of the method, all trustworthy and attested. His *On the Verification of Returning and Restoration* describes the seven-day completion of the Great Heavenly Circuit in particular detail—among ten thousand volumes of elixir texts, only this one exposes the secret. Truly, it is the great treasure of the Mystic Tradition and the hidden repository of elixir practitioners.\n\nIn general, the essence of the elixir method lies in emptying and stilling the self to attract the arrival of primordial true yang. The deeper the degree of emptiness and stillness, the more abundant the coming of true yang—like a teacup: only by increasing its emptiness can one add more water. As true yang grows ever fuller, the original spirit flourishes, and the power of concentration strengthens. Thus, when refining essence into qi is complete, azure hair regrows, and the skin emits light. Advancing further, red blood turns white, the pupils become square, and the sinews, teeth, blood, and marrow—all undergo transformation, each renewing the old cauldron. At night, sleep is soundless; in labor, one does not tire. Eventually, qi transforms into spirit, eliminating sleep and food; wisdom’s light shines inwardly, and external realms dissolve into emptiness. All this flows naturally, requiring no forced arrangement.\n\nAs for verification in the Dharma-body, elixir texts speak of it only briefly. In my view, what the elixir method values is the Dharma-body, not the physical body. Therefore, from the very beginning, one must depart from the physical body, resting the mind and breath outside the body until great samadhi is attained. Even samadhi is established externally, using its power to subdue delusion and eliminate desire, and employing wisdom to shatter ignorance. One turns birth-and-death into nirvana, transforms affliction into unshakable wisdom, breaks through the five aggregates to emerge from the five turbidities, and eradicates habitual tendencies of views and thoughts without remainder. The true nature becomes perfectly luminous, pervading the Dharma-realm, with the Dao’s capacities fully realized—every thought instantly fulfilled. Thus, verification in the Dharma-body is even more precious than that in the physical body.\n\nAs the Perfected Ziyang said:\n*\"Deep in the night, the moon shines bright,\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\"*\n\nLi Qing’an wrote:\n*\"I ask: what is the verification of completing the work?\nThe moon’s radiance encircles heaven and earth.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said:\n*\"Activate the samadhi fire of the Heavenly Circuit,\nTempering true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"Constantly apply the work,\nThe bright moon hangs in the sky, glowing red above the crown,\nIlluminating one’s own master.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The mind and the sun-moon share a great radiance,\nI and heaven-and-earth are inner and outer.\nShattering emptiness is no trifling matter,\nGathering the six directions into a single millet grain.\"*\n\nAll these illustrate the verification in the Dharma-body. The verification of the Dharma-body takes samadhi and wisdom as its foundation.\n\n*Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"The Great Unity flows through it; great samadhi upholds it.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The empty chamber generates brightness; auspiciousness abides in stillness.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Follow the ears and eyes in inward communication, while transcending the mind’s knowledge.\"*\n\nThis precisely reveals the image of great samadhi—profoundly still—and wisdom—perfectly luminous.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s section on breaking through the five aggregates describes the stages one must traverse in samadhi.\n\n---\n\n**53. The Classic of Nurturing Life**\n\nIn *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, Nanrong Chu inquired of Laozi about the classic of nurturing life. Laozi said:\n*\"The classic of nurturing life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill fortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you abandon others and seek within yourself? Can you be carefree? Can you be unconstrained? Can you be like a child? A child cries all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony; clenches its fists all day without stiffness—such is the sharing of its power; gazes all day without blinking—its focus is not external. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, flowing with things and moving with the waves. This is the classic of nurturing life.\"*\n\nNanrong Chu said: *\"Then is this the virtue of the Perfected Person?\"*\nLaozi replied: *\"No.\"*",

As for verification in the physical body, the patriarchs Zhengyang, Ziyang, Cuixu, Sanfeng, and Qiyun have spoken of it in detail.

      "translated_text": "This is what is called \"melting like ice and thawing like frost.\"\n\nThe Perfected Person shares sustenance with others upon the earth and shares joy with them under heaven. They do not entangle themselves with the gains and losses of others, nor do they conspire in strangeness, nor scheme together, nor engage in affairs. They come and go with carefree ease. This is the classic of nurturing life.\n\nThe commentary states: *Jing* (經) means the constant Dao. This chapter reveals the essentials of the Way of nurturing life: \"embracing the One without separation, and uniting one’s virtue with that of an infant.\" To \"embrace the One\" is to harmonize the heart with the breath, where the two luminaries meet and merge into one, refining the *qi* to achieve softness, just like the state of an infant. \"To stop\" means to be still—concentrating the spirit and entering the *qi*-cavern, so the heart attains stability. \"To cease\" means to rest. As the ancients said: \"Suddenly severing the ten thousand conditions, transcending the stream of life and death.\" Severing conditions is the crucial step in entering the Dao. \"Carefree\" means being unburdened by worldly dust. \"Unconstrained\" means being without knowledge. The following passage specifically illustrates the infant’s essence of harmony and softness, its virtue of unknowing and unawareness. \"Walking without knowing where it goes, dwelling without knowing what it does\"—this fully demonstrates the wonder of forgetting things and self, responding without intention. To nurture life is to reach the state of primordial chaos and unite one’s virtue with that of an infant, so that the spirit is whole and the *qi* is gathered. \"Flowing with things and moving with the waves\"—the phrase *wei yi* (委蛇) is most profound, meaning to neither grasp nor reject things beyond their form. When matters arise, respond; when they depart, do not cling, like the reflection of light on waves—universally responsive yet without intention, following events without attachment. The virtue of an infant is without intention or emotion, neither resisting nor refusing, hence it is said: \"It gazes all day without blinking, cries all day without hoarseness, clenches its fists all day without stiffness.\" \"The Perfected Person shares sustenance with others upon the earth and shares joy with them under heaven\"—this means the heart and breath depend on each other, summoning the true *yang* of heaven and earth, drinking harmony to nourish life, delighting in heaven and accepting fate. Simply entering the samadhi of self-reception, they do not concern themselves with the gains and losses of others, returning to the great void in primordial chaos. \"Coming and going with carefree ease\"—this is uniting with the virtue of heaven, and the classic of nurturing life is complete.\n\nThe formula states:\n*Empty, still, tranquil, and detached,\nHeart and breath unite as one.\nExternally, harmonize with heaven’s harmony,\nAwakening the life-force within.\nLife-force without end,\nLife too knows no bounds.\nThis is nurturing life,\nAnd thus attaining longevity.\nThe mysterious origin of *qi*-transformation—\nThis is the supreme attainment.*\n\n**54. The Wonder of Living Burial**\nLinji Chan Master said: \"In other schools, they cremate the dead; here, we bury the living.\" Master Chongyang said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! Burying the four illusions is the cause. Sleeping soundly in the tomb, utterly free—shattering empty space, trampling the dust to pieces.\" He also said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! Attaining death in life is the true cause. In the tomb, tranquil and empty—true emptiness—cutting off the worldly dust of the mortal realm.\" Again, he said: \"A living dead man, ah, a living dead man! In emptiness upon emptiness lies the cause of emptiness. In the tomb, the true scene of emptiness—awakening to emptiness, no longer making dust.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"In the mysterious origin of cultivating the true, nothing is more wondrous than living death and living burial. Where does one perform this living burial?\"\n\nThe answer: The empty space itself is the place of living burial. Preserve the spirit in the void, uniting it with the breath, directly entering the realm of great samadhi. After one round of living burial, attaining life within death, naturally spring arises beyond the kalpas, withered trees bloom anew. At that time, there will be boundless self-reception and endless life-force, as it is said: \"Only after this great death does one now live.\" Thus it is said: \"Having been born, kill life; before dying, learn to die—then you will attain longevity.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"At this moment, the breath ceases as in a small death, merging into one—this is the complete truth.\" Wang Qixuan said: \"When the fire of the celestial cycle ignites, the whole body, from top to bottom, aches—piercing the bones, penetrating the sinews. The *qi* flows through the four limbs and hundreds of channels, the bones as if shattered. One may lose consciousness for three to five days, reopening the primordial chaos, reestablishing heaven and earth. This is the fire-time of the celestial cycle. When the work reaches this point, one will surely ascend.\" The ancients had the metaphor of \"one coffin, two corpses\"—this is the wondrous metaphor for the spirit and breath both stabilizing in the void. When the work reaches the point where body and mind are utterly still and unmoving, then the meaning of living burial is attained.\n\nThe formula states:\n*The fire-time of the celestial cycle,\nCrushing the body to dust.\nThree days in primordial chaos,\nDying and reviving.\nReestablishing the fetal womb,\nRecreating heaven and earth.\nThe wondrous Dao of the mysterious origin—\nFar beyond ordinary sentiments.\nThe wise trust and cultivate,\nSurely attaining longevity.*\n\n**55. The Land of Virtue and the Dao**\nIn the *Zhuangzi*, \"Mountain Trees\" chapter, it is said: Zhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a large tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stopped beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, Zhuangzi was told: \"It is of no use.\" Zhuangzi said: \"This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan!\" Later, the Master left the mountains and lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked: \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\" The host said: \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\" The next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi: \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, fulfilled its natural lifespan; today, the host’s goose, by being useless, died. Where will the Master position himself?\" Zhuangzi laughed and said: \"I will position myself between usefulness and uselessness.\"",

      "translated_text": "Between usefulness and uselessness—this is but an approximation, not the truth, and thus one remains entangled in burdens. Yet if one rides the Dao and virtue, drifting freely, it is not so. Without praise or blame, now a dragon, now a serpent, one transforms with the times, never clinging to a single form. Rising and falling, one takes harmony as the measure, drifting among the ancestor of the ten thousand things. Treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be burdened?\n\nThis is the method of the Yellow Emperor and Shennong. As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction; sharpness invites defeat, honor invites criticism, action incurs loss, worth invites schemes, and worthlessness invites deceit. How can one ever be certain?\n\nAlas! Disciples, take heed—only in the realm of Dao and virtue can this be so.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s parable here reveals how worldly affairs are like hooks and files: union and separation, completion and destruction, worth and worthlessness, schemes and deceits—none can escape entanglement. Only by drifting beyond the realm of images and the Emperor, where mind and subtle breath merge in wondrous harmony, where dragon and serpent alike transform, where nature and destiny are cultivated in tandem, where rising and falling unite in harmony, where wondrous being and true emptiness interpenetrate, where the primordial harmony fuses—only by returning to the subtle and formless, transcending the five aggregates, and forever leaving birth and death behind can one attain carefree ease and transcend death without reliance. Thus, to escape the suffering of rebirth and the burden of life and death, there is nothing but the diligent cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\n---\n\n**56.

Prince Shao asked: \"My lord, why do you appear so troubled?\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu replied: \"I have studied the Way of the former kings and cultivated the undertakings of my predecessors. I revere the spirits, honor the worthy, and practice these virtues without the slightest lapse. Yet I cannot escape misfortune—this is why I am troubled.\"\n\nPrince Shao said: \"My lord, your method of avoiding misfortune is too shallow! The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in rocky caves, and remain still. They move by night and rest by day, ever vigilant. Though hungry and thirsty, they still keep their distance from rivers and lakes while seeking food, ever composed. Yet they cannot escape the snares and traps—what crime have they committed? Their pelts are their calamity.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the Lord of Lu alone is not your pelt? I wish for you to flay your form and shed your skin, to cleanse your heart and cast off desire, then wander in the wilds where no man dwells.\n\nIn the southern lands of Yue there is a city called the Realm of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with few selfish desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where propriety is born, nor where ritual is led. Reckless and unconstrained in their actions, they tread the great square of the Dao. Their lives are joyful, their deaths are burials.\n\nI wish for you to abandon your state and forsake custom, then walk alongside the Dao as your companion.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"That path is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what can be done?\"\n\nPrince Shao replied: \"Do not be rigid in form, do not linger in place—take this as your carriage.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"That path is secluded and remote, with no one there. With whom shall I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?\"\n\nPrince Shao replied: \"Lessen your expenditures, reduce your desires—though you have no provisions, you will have enough. Cross the river and float upon the sea. Gaze upon it and you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the less you will know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, and you will be far from here. Thus, those who possess others are burdened; those who are seen by others are troubled. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was seen by them. I wish to remove your burdens, dispel your troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless realm.\"\n\nLiu Xuxi said: \"How profound, Master! You wander beyond the dust of the world, describing all you see with vivid clarity. You prepare carriages and provisions to send him off—whether as illusion or immortality, it is as it is. Reading to the point where they turn back from the shore, one feels the lightness of casting off old sandals. Is this not the pinnacle of discourse on the land of virtue and the artistry of writing?\"\n\nLu Fanghu’s *Nanhua Fumo* states: \"The entire passage speaks as if scratching an itch through a boot, casually using the fox and leopard to expound on stillness, vigilance, and composure. Clearly, this elder’s words are all parables about the Dao. The fox and leopard bring disaster upon themselves with their pelts, just as the Lord’s troubles arise from the state of Lu—both are burdens of existence. Thus, he wishes the Lord to flay his form and shed his skin to purify the exterior, to cleanse his heart and cast off desire to purify the interior, then wander in the wilds where no man dwells, solitary and alone. This would make him inwardly unaware of himself and outwardly unaware of others—the greatest liberation in the world. What external burdens could then trouble him? The original intent of Zhuangzi and Laozi is simply to urge people to return their hearts to the Dao, to be utterly bare and unadorned, entirely free from worldly burdens. This is the mindset of the sage who possesses the world yet does not cling to it. If one’s duty to the state is weighty, how could one lightly abandon the state of Lu? Yet if we speak of severing attachment and discarding the source of calamity, then everyone has a fox’s pelt, everyone has a state of Lu. The meaning lies beyond the words.\"\n\nXuanjing said: \"This chapter uses the Dao to inspire people to leave the burning house of worldly toil and reach the wondrous realm of purity, stillness, and joy. The so-called boundless realm is the land of the formless and the soundless; the wilds where no man dwells are the state of great samadhi. When scholars regulate their breath and concentrate their spirit, returning their spirit and qi to their root, they pass through the indistinct and obscure to reach perfect stillness. Forgetting things and forgetting cares, without self or others, in a state of unknowing and undifferentiation—this is wandering with the Dao in the boundless realm. As the practice deepens, body and mind become profoundly still, unstained by the six senses, undisturbed by worldly desires. Naturally, one becomes carefree and at ease, transcending all phenomena.\n\nYet this is the principle; the work at the edge of the dharma realm is called 'principle distant from dust'—it does not mean abandoning one’s duties or family. If scholars can cast off everything, then with a few like-minded companions, they may retreat to nurture their nature amidst green mountains and clear waters, roaming freely in thatched huts and stone chambers, far from the bustling marketplace. In such a tranquil setting, the mind easily becomes still, and samadhi and the Dao are readily attained. Thus, Han Qingfu’s poem says: *'The green mountains and flowing waters are my home.'* The ancients attained the Dao in the mountains and forests for this reason—this is called 'both principle and practice distant,' the most sublime path.\"\n\n**57. The Wanderings of Gathering the True**\n*Zhuangzi, \"The Turning of Heaven\"* states: \"The perfected people of old borrowed the Dao of benevolence and lodged in righteousness, wandering in the emptiness of freedom. They ate from the fields of simplicity, stood in the gardens of non-transaction. Freedom is non-action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this the wanderings of gathering the true.\"\n\nExplanation: The perfected people of old regarded benevolence and righteousness as expedients for governing the world, treating them like temporary lodgings without lingering in them. They wandered freely in the land of the formless and soundless, simply following their own inclinations. Simplicity means ease of nourishment. Confucius said: *\"Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its abilities. What is easy is easy to know; what is simple is easy to follow.\"* This \"field of simplicity\" is the empty space beyond the body—what the school of the mysterious calls the Yellow Court, the Center of the Compass, the Chamber of Spirit, the Earthen Cauldron, the Cinnabar Field. Concentrating the spirit here and merging it wondrously with the breath, one enters fetal breathing. The external senses draw in the primordial qi, which enters the body, nourishing the constructive and defensive energies, steaming and melting the fluids—this is the true practice of eating from the fields of simplicity.",

      "translated_text": "The common folk cultivate gardens and fields to sustain their livelihoods, while Daoists tend the Cinnabar Field to nourish life. The primordial qi of Great Harmony is inexhaustibly summoned and gathered; jade nectar and liquid jasper are endlessly consumed. Such is its wondrous efficacy—hence it is called \"simplicity and ease of nourishment.\"\n\nThose who rely on borrowing have no true exit. Ordinary people’s breath flows in and out without self-mastery; should a single breath fail to come, life is no longer their own. They stand in the garden of borrowed existence. \"Borrowing\" means debt—with the creditor’s claim resting in another, far from secure. The creditor may press demands at any time, leaving no escape. Only when mind and breath interdepend, when external breath ceases yet one remains in perfect serenity—like the antelope hanging its horns, leaving no trace to be found—does the power over life and death shift from another to oneself. Creation cannot then constrain one; this is the wondrous state of non-borrowing. If there is borrowing, there is the breath of exit and entry; without borrowing, there is no breath of exit and entry. With neither exit nor entry, one merges with the vast oneness of heaven—this accords with the mystery of the ancient primordial Dao.\n\nThis great quiescent samādhi of no exit or entry is the profound subtlety of the alchemical school, the true mechanism of gathering and refinement. It is called the wandering of gathering the real—profound and subtle indeed. The secret formula states:\n*Empty, still, tranquil, and serene,\nSpirit and breath harmoniously blend.\nEmptiness and being fuse as one,\nSelf and other are not two.\nWithin and without merge completely,\nNature and life return to unity.\nTrue emptiness, great samādhi,\nBeyond form, beyond name.\nThe gathering that is no-gathering—\nGreat Harmony fills to overflowing.*\n\nThe mysteries of the Daoist school were revealed by Laozi and Zhuangzi. In this profound treatise, the two sages stand as ancestors. Once the treasury of emptiness is unlocked, one may freely partake.\n\n58. The Mystery of Fasting the Mind\nIn the \"World of Men\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, Yan Hui says: \"My family is poor, and for months I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Can this be called fasting?\" [Confucius] replied: \"That is the fasting for sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.\" Yan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fasting of the mind?\" Zhongni said: \"Unify your will! Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing, the mind to matching signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness—this is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had yet received this teaching, I was truly myself; having received it, I am as if I have never been myself. Can this be called emptiness?\" The Master said: \"It is complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master [i.e., the commentator] states: *The Zhuangzi* employs the dialogue between Confucius and Yan Hui to illuminate the subtlety of \"fasting of the mind.\" Li Qing’an’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* says:\n\n*To be immortal, Buddha, or Confucian—*\n*The Three Teachings transmit but one emptiness.*\n*From ancient times to now, those who transcend*\n*All cultivate within this emptiness.*\n\nNow, *The Zhuangzi* declares: *\"Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness—this is the fasting of the mind.\"* This precisely reveals that both the Confucian and Daoist traditions begin with emptiness and quiescence, progressing from the interdependence of mind and breath to the realm of great samādhi and true emptiness. Body, mind, and world dissolve entirely, directly attaining \"that which precedes the Lord of Images.\" Self and dharma forgotten, principle and phenomena both extinguished—such is the subtlety of the fasting of the mind. The key to this dharma-gate lies in \"reversing hearing to hear the self’s cessation.\"\n\n*\"Unify your will!\"*—this means directing the will without distraction. Hearing with the ears, hearing with the mind, and hearing with qi constitute three progressive stages. *Zhuangzi* seeks to guide one into profound realization, hence the inverted phrasing: *\"Do not listen with the ears, do not listen with the mind.\"* Beginners listen to the breath with their ears; when the practice matures, the ears are no longer needed—with a single turn of awareness, perception arises naturally. As skill deepens further, even the thought of turning awareness fades, and the mind spontaneously harmonizes with the breath. Breath and mind merge effortlessly, and I simply abide in the naturalness of emptiness. Only when body, mind, and the external world are wholly forgotten can this be called \"hearing with qi.\" From hearing the breath to hearing with qi, one enters the purely prenatal realm.\n\nIn essence, hearing with qi is the true message beyond mind, intention, and consciousness. As *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says, it is *\"emptiness and awareness perfectly rounded.\"* The subsequent text states: *\"The ears are limited to hearing\"* (some editions read *\"hearing is limited to the ears\"*), meaning the function of the ears culminates in their capacity to hear. *\"The mind is limited to matching signs\"*—the function of the mind culminates in its capacity for perception. Yet traces of subject and object remain: where there is a hearer, there must be something heard; where there is perception, there must be something perceived. Only upon reaching true emptiness do subject and object dissolve together, leaving only a single emptiness. This is called *\"the samādhi of a single dharma-realm’s adornment,\"* which perfectly accords with the subtlety of the fasting of the mind.\n\nYan Hui says: *\"Before I practiced the fasting of the mind, the notion of self had not yet vanished, and I truly felt the presence of Yan Hui. Once I practiced it, both body and mind became empty, and neither self nor other remained. It was as if 'I halted at the back, losing my body; walked in the courtyard, yet saw no one.' Could this be called emptiness?\"* Confucius affirmed it, saying: *\"It is complete.\"* Yet this is merely provisional approval. One must understand that to sit fixedly in the realm of emptiness is still to dwell in a nest—only when one reaches *The Zhuangzi*’s state of *\"neither having one nor having nothing,\"* where both being and non-being are ungrasped, does one attain the ultimate fasting of the mind.\n\n**59. The Subtlety of Reversing the Flow**\n*\"Following the current, one enters the sea of birth and death; reversing the current, one emerges from the sea of birth and death.\"* The term \"reverse\" means to go against the flow, tracing back to the origin before birth, and attaining \"that which precedes the Lord of Images.\" It also carries the sense of \"returning,\" meaning the *\"revolving return to the origin.\"* *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *\"Entering deeply through one gate in reverse, the six senses become simultaneously pure,\"* and *\"reversing the flow to perfect oneness, the six functions cease.\"* *The Book of Changes* says: *\"Return: cooking, the firm reverses,\"* and *\"tracing origins and reversing endings, one knows the discourse on death and life.\"* The Old Master [Laozi] says:\n\n*The multitude bustles, as if feasting at a grand sacrifice,*\n*As if ascending a springtime terrace.*\n*I alone drift, without sign,*\n*Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,*\n*Unattached, as if with nowhere to return.*\n*The multitude all have more than enough,*\n*While I alone seem bereft.*\n*I have the heart of a fool—how muddled!*\n*The vulgar are bright; I alone am dim.*\n*The vulgar are sharp; I alone am dull.*\n\nHe also says: *\"Profound virtue is deep and far, turning back with things,\"* and *\"return to the root, return to simplicity, return to the limitless, return to nothingness.\"* All these are the esoteric principles of reversing the flow and the practice of revolving return. *\"I alone seem bereft\"*—this is the forgetting of both inner and outer, body and mind. *\"Dim\"*—this is the state of primal chaos, knowing nothing and perceiving nothing. Master Sanfeng says: *\"Return to a state of dull silence, like one drunk or foolish.\"* At the moment of coalescing the elixir, the hundred vessels return to their source, and the breath ceases as in a small death—this is the true realm of dullness and oblivion, the authentic message of the Daoist tradition’s *\"reversing the flow to perfect oneness, where the six functions cease.\"*\n\nIn *The Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s assembly, the twenty-five sages each expounded their path to perfect penetration. For instance, Aniruddha’s *\"revolving vision to follow the origin,\"* Gavāṃpati’s *\"returning taste to revolve awareness,\"* Subhūti’s *\"revolving dharmas to return to nothingness,\"* Cūḍapanthaka’s *\"reversing breath to empty space,\"* and Avalokiteśvara’s *\"entering the flow and forgetting the source\"*—all illustrate the purport of reversing the flow. In the Daoist tradition, practice begins with regulating the breath, its subtlety lying in revolving hearing to merge with the breath, and revolving the breath to return to the origin. This perfectly aligns with the Buddhist principle of *\"reversing breath to empty space.\"* \"Reversing the breath\" means shifting from the breath of existence to the breath of non-existence. The breath of non-breath is called the true breath. The Daoist tradition, through revolving the breath, enters true emptiness and emerges into wondrous being, achieving the dual perfection of emptiness and existence, the marvel of both form and spirit. One attains the three liberations, realizes the patience of non-arising, and shares the same fruition as the twenty-five sages.\n\n**60. The Beauty of Yang Harmony**\nWhen spring’s qi is harmonious and mild, when spring winds are warm and gentle, when orioles sing and swallows chatter, when flowers bloom and waters flow—all things at this time flourish and grow.",

      "translated_text": "In sum, when one’s practice reaches the point where the entire body softens and melts, true qi steams and suffuses, one enters the realm of yang harmony. For every fraction of original yang that advances, a corresponding fraction of yin qi is dispelled. By frequently abiding in this realm of yang harmony, one constantly summons and attracts the primordial unity of qi to the palace. Over time, yin is exhausted and yang becomes pure, and one naturally transforms in form to become an immortal.\n\nThe Mystery School indeed prizes yang harmony, yet the Chan school is no different in this regard. At the moment of great awakening in the lineage, the wondrous luminous true mind—the inherently pure and radiant essence—suddenly manifests. Wherever the realm of yin intrudes, it is wholly dissolved and smelted away, presenting the image of the great earth returning to spring.\n\nHaving perused the *Song Mirror* and *Dharma Grove* and other works, I find that the poems and gathas of ancient worthies extolling \"the beauty of yang harmony\" are beyond counting. Zen Master Dongshan Jia says:\n\n*\"Withered trees bloom with spring beyond kalpas,\nRiding the royal elephant backward to chase the qilin.\"*\n\nGreat Master Mingbin says:\n\n*\"Withered trees roar with dragon’s song, the great earth in spring,\nSpirit roots sprout from cold crag’s grass.\"*\n\nZen Master Fengxue Zhi says:\n\n*\"Ever recalling the third month in Jiangnan,\nWhere orioles sing, a hundred flowers fragrance.\"*\n\nZen Master Ping Zhiyang says:\n\n*\"Clouds part, moonlight fills every home,\nSpring comes, flowers bloom in every place.\"*\n\nZen Master Nanjian Wen says:\n\n*\"Like wind blowing fire—no great effort,\nSpring fills the imperial capital’s four hundred prefectures.\nTipping over the great earth to reveal yang spring,\nMistaking orioles’ songs for entering willow shade.\nDisheartened, night deepens, sobering from wine,\nLaughing at them still lodging in the deep village.\"*\n\nZen Master Li’an Ding says:\n\n*\"Mud oxen bellow at the moon, cold pools sink,\nWooden horses neigh in the wind, Mount Tai renewed.\nGazing up and down, heaven and earth are utterly undivided,\nInstantly teaching grasses and trees to harmonize with yang spring.\"*\n\nZen Master Xiuyan Rui says:\n\n*\"Village songs and communal dances—where is the nāga’s samādhi?\nMangy dogs and mud pigs—pure bodies.\nPenetrating root and dust, no Buddha-dharma,\nUḍumbara flowers bloom across the ten continents in spring.\"*\n\nZen Master Fohui Quan says:\n\n*\"Before father and mother were born,\nWhere was the nose’s place?\nOld hands in the grove\nAll obscure the hiding verse.\nThough Mount Gu sees the opportunity,\nIt still props up the gate.\"*",

flourish?\nOnly because they have endured frost and snow.\nYet the lone rider on his lame donkey stands,\nUnknowing of spring’s descent upon the mossy rocks.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Without the spring wind, flowers do not open;\nOnce open, they are blown away by the wind.\nScattered petals trampled into mud,\nTheir lingering fragrance swells in vain.\"*\n\nMaster Zifu Guan says:\n*\"Spring gardens

home?\nOnce he trod the path by Wuling Stream’s banks—\nThe grotto’s spring surpasses the mortal world.\"*\n\nMaster Gunan Men says:\n*\"Each bout of wind and snow brings deeper cold,\nYet when the cold recedes, spring’s warmth expands.\nWhy labor to repeat what’s already clear?\nWest of the post station lies Chang’an.\"*\n\nMaster Li’an Ding says:\n*\"A towering iron staff grinds against the moon,\nEnduring frost and snow, its spirit shines brighter.\nSuddenly, in the night corridor, it opens a laughing mouth—\nBy dawn, the earth is steeped in spring.\"*\n\nMaster Hongding Jiao says:\n*\"Layer upon layer of mist and rain chant the moss,\nHow does spring’s light arrive from ten thousand miles?\nWhen the partridge calls, the sun warms the clearing,\nAnd the bamboo staff ascends the Terrace of Gazing Home.\"*\n\nMaster Xianghu Ren says:\n*\"Leisurely he climbs, leaning on the railing,\nGazing at the streams and mountains framed like a painting.\nIn the immortal garden, spring winds stir pipes and strings,\nAmid the throng of songs, the sound of rain grows dense.\"*\n\nMaster Haihui Xing says:\n*\"To transplant flowers, one loves the fine, misting rain;\nTo plant willows, one prefers a dim, overcast sky.\nBehold the early spring of Shanglin Park—\nFlowers cradle pearls of dew, willows veil themselves in mist.\"*\n\nMaster Deshi Xin says:\n*\"The spring wind brushes wildflowers into crimson,\nTheir branches high and low, some pale, some deep.\nEndless vistas of water and mountain hues—\nA single bird’s cry echoes through the empty peaks.\"*\n\nHe also says:\n*\"To grasp and release is but wasted effort,\nCircling thoughts lead nowhere.\nSuddenly turning back, spring is late—\nAt the staff’s tip, a single red orb is won.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A hidden bird sings in the tall trees,\nFading blossoms drift upon the flowing stream.\nUnknowing that spring is late,\nThe lotus blooms, its fragrance filling the nine continents.\"*\n\nMaster Falin Yin says:\n*\"Spring reaches the peach blossoms, overflowing the water’s source,\nA world apart, its splendor unique.\nThe fisherman dares not speak of it to others,\nFearing it might stir idle sorrow in his descendants.\"*\n\nMaster Deqing Qi says:\n*\"All because of the moon over Huaidi,\nIt illuminates the spring of Yingyang.\nA single arrow pierces the layered pass—\nHis merit high, yet he raises no banner.\"*\n\nMaster Miaoyun Xiong says:\n*\"A single uncarved lump, the heart of primordial antiquity—\nWho has so cunningly chiseled it, losing its true purity?\nThough one may wield the power to mend the sky with molten stone,\nHow can one resist the East Lord’s early teasing of spring?\"*\n\nMaster Quanyue Zu says:\n*\"The moon over the river, the plum’s sparse shadows sway,\nIn subtle hues, spring stirs in the Penglai gardens.\nA gust of harmonious wind betrays all—\nHeaven is filled with fragrance, guiding travelers to the ford.\"*\n\nMaster Cishou Shen says:\n*\"For saints and mortals, no separate paths diverge,\nYet how many know the source of their own thoughts?\nThe spring wind never reaches Peach Blossom Spring—\nLeaves fall and flowers bloom in their own time.\"*\n\nMaster Tiantong Hua says:\n*\"The garden’s spring lingers on the branches,\nVexing the spring wind, which never rests.\nIdly, at dusk, he gazes upon the river—\nTwo or three fishing boats drift by.\"*\n\nMaster Lan’an Shu says:\n*\"Watching others ride horses and play polo,\nHe realizes only now how late he’s entered the temple.\nThe official road fades as spring reaches its prime—\nThe plum by the river insists he compose a poem.\"*\n\nMaster Zhe’an Fan says:\n*\"Honors and favors bind him in a traveler’s dream,\nThe palace orioles’ calls make him long for home.\nWhen he returns, jade pendants chiming on his steed,\nThe second month’s mountains are all in bloom.\"*\n\nMaster Wanshan Ning says:\n*\"No sign of the pool, no sign of the dragon,\nYet his whole being

eastern crags, western peaks brighten,\nFrom the southern islets, the sound of flutes rises.\nThe sky’s light is heavy, his robes damp with sleep—\nOrioles warble on high branches, willows draped in spring.\"*\n\nMaster Chufang An says:\n*\"If the favorable wind does not come, spring ages,\nYet he recalls the donkey grazing in the back garden.\nA full moon in the sky gifts the traveler,\nBy the

Gathered here, they form a jade forest of jasper trees, a magnificent sight. Though much within holds profound meaning, beginners may not easily fathom it. Yet even a single recitation stirs the vastness of spring’s qi, the grace of spring’s light, the gentle breath of spring’s wind, boundless spring’s intent—unexpectedly aligning with the profound Dao. This too is wondrous.\n\nWhen the mind is still and breath harmonized, water and fire merge as one. Entering the garden of radiant spring, continuing the melody of spring’s harmony, one naturally grasps its subtleties, personally savoring samādhi—beyond what brush and ink can fully express.\n\n**61. The Benefits of Emptiness and Stillness**\n\nThe Dao enters through emptiness and stillness, and is realized through emptiness and stillness. Emptiness means an empty mind; stillness means tranquil qi—this is the profound essential of cultivating both nature and life. If the mind is not empty, qi is not still; if qi is not still, breath is not harmonized; if breath is not harmonized, spirit does not congeal. Only when both spirit and qi are still, reaching great samādhi and returning to emptiness and nothingness, does one attain the true purport of “returning to the root and recovering life.” Thus the ancient sage said: *“Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness—\nthe ten thousand things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nThings flourish abundantly,\neach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness;\nstillness is called recovering life.\nRecovering life is called constancy.”*\n\nMaster Qianxu writes in *Xuanlan*:\n*“The Dao is fundamentally empty, still, and unified. When stillness reaches its extreme, it moves. Wandering qi stirs in profusion, giving rise to the ten thousand distinct beings, and the Dao begins to fall into the realm of later heaven’s names and forms. Thus, those who embody the Dao originally return to the beginning, taking the attainment of emptiness and guarding stillness as their foundation. Constantly observing within purity and stillness, not a single thing clings—how empty and still! With the slightest thing, emptiness is filled and stillness disturbed. The great void, vast and open—yet a single cloud drifts and obstructs its clarity. The deep spring, limpid and still—yet a slight breeze rises and stirs its waves. How can one restore its original essence? Those who embody the Dao must constantly discipline this mind: what is within does not go out, what is without does not enter. Thus, the breast is clear and unburdened, not a speck of dust clings. In this way, one restores the original sky-like, deep, and limpid essence—this may be called attaining utmost emptiness. Who but those who guard deep stillness can achieve this?”*\n\nHe also says:\n*“Thus, returning to the root is the Dao’s movement reaching its extreme and becoming still. Therefore, beings follow the mechanism to enter—hence, returning to the root is called stillness.

      "translated_text": "Master Shao says: *“The sage shares the same body as the Great Void and the same function as Heaven and Earth.”* This is precisely the case. The great person harmonizes their virtue with Heaven and Earth—how could one achieve such harmony without the emptiness and stillness of body and mind?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Heavenly Dao” chapter states: *“The sage’s stillness is not because stillness is inherently good, but because nothing in the myriad things can disturb their mind—hence, they are still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and brows, and its level surface serves as a standard for the great craftsman. If still water is so luminous, how much more so the spirit! The sage’s mind is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the reflection of the ten thousand things. Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. Resting in them is emptiness; emptiness becomes fullness, and fullness is order. Emptiness is stillness; stillness moves, and movement attains. Stillness is non-action; through non-action, those who handle affairs bear responsibility. Through non-action, one attains serenity; serenity means cares and troubles cannot abide, and longevity is achieved. Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the root of the ten thousand things. Understanding this and facing south, one becomes a ruler like Yao; understanding this and facing north, one becomes a minister like Shun. Practicing this in a high position, it is the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; practicing this in a low position, it is the Way of the profound sage and the uncrowned king. Retiring with this and wandering in leisure, it is embraced by recluses of rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; advancing with this to support the world, it brings great merit, illustrious fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.”*\n\nHe also says: *“Using emptiness and stillness to ride the waves and assist Heaven and Earth, penetrating the ten thousand things—this is called heavenly joy.”*\n\nThe *Carving Intentions* chapter states: *“Emptiness and tranquility accord with the virtue of Heaven.”* *“Unchanging oneness is the perfection of stillness; nothing opposing it is the perfection of emptiness; no interaction with things is the perfection of tranquility; nothing resisting it is the perfection of purity. Thus it is said: Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, tranquil and non-active, moving in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit.”*\n\nThe *Human World* chapter states: *“Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”*\n\nThe *Liezi* says: *“Nothing surpasses stillness; nothing surpasses emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these attain their proper place.”*\n\nI observe: What the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* expound fully inherits the intent of the ancient sages’ *“attaining emptiness and guarding stillness.”* This is the orthodox lineage of the profound tradition, the bridge to returning to the root and recovering life, the essential element of reversion.\n\nSpeaking of practice, it lies solely in the interdependence of the body’s breath and the mind’s rest, thereby attaining great samadhi. The essentials of emptiness and stillness were revealed by the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, and *Liezi*, and later generations of true immortals inherited and expounded upon them.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Four Hundred Words* states: *“Emptiness gives birth to white snow; stillness sprouts the yellow sprout.”*\n\nLi Daochun’s *Song of Refining Emptiness* says: *“In learning immortality, emptiness and stillness are the essence of the elixir.”* He also says: *“Emptiness reaches its extreme, and primordial qi congeals; stillness reaches its depth, and yang returns.”* And: *“Gathering lead relies on emptiness and non-action; advancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows. All reduction and augmentation depend on emptiness; shattering emptiness itself achieves great awakening.”*\n\nMaster Boyang’s *Triple Concordance* states: *“Inwardly nurture the self with tranquility and emptiness.”*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Examination and Commentary on the Triple Concordance* says: *“Tranquility and emptiness—these four words are the essential secret of nurturing the self. A thousand sages and ten thousand perfected ones share this single principle. The *Laozi* says: ‘Attain the extreme of emptiness; guard stillness firmly. The ten thousand things arise together, and I observe their return.’ Master Sima’s *On Sitting in Forgetfulness* states: ‘When the mind is at peace and empty, the Dao naturally comes to reside.’ Man is born still—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, it becomes desire. Once there is desire, the ears are seduced by sounds, the eyes seized by colors, and the mouth spoiled by flavors. The true nature is lost, and primordial essence and primordial qi are thereby depleted, and one’s life follows. Thus, nurturing the self takes tranquility and emptiness as its foundation. Tranquility and emptiness mean: Do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence. Not a single thought arises, and the ten thousand conditions are all empty. The mind is like the Great Void, not clinging to a single thing. Master Xu Jing said: ‘To keep the spirit within the mind from departing, do not allow a single thing to remain in the numinous terrace. If things reside in the mind, the spirit is not clear, and true essence is dissipated, harming the sinews and bones.’ If scholars can thoroughly investigate the original state and turn their light inward to illuminate it, they will know that within clarity and stillness, not a single thing exists—and that so-called tranquility and emptiness are attained within oneself.”*\n\nFloating Hill Immortal Ancestor says: *“Resolving to return primordial essence to qi is the beginning; in the midst of emptiness and stillness, one obtains the cloud ladder.”*\n\nAncestor Lü says: *“Primordial qi is the true mystery; within the mystery lies the mysterious mechanism, which requires stillness and focus.”* He also says: *“Each explores the mysterious mechanism within stillness; in stillness’s subtlety, one attains the profound and wondrous.”*\n\nThe secret says: The initial practice of the profound tradition is to concentrate the spirit in emptiness—this is the essential meaning of an empty mind. When breath harmonizes with the mind, it is the true secret of still qi. When breath is regulated and the mind is concentrated, one attains great samadhi. Body and mind become profoundly still, unchanging and unmoving, utterly like the Great Void—thus, the principle of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness is realized.\n\nFloating Hill Ancestor says: *“Wisdom arises from samadhi; samadhi is attained through stillness. The true meaning of stillness is difficult to fathom. Testing within emptiness, stillness is not samadhi. Movement captures the numinous mechanism; clinging is not the profound. The stillness within the profound—its subtlety is hard to express.”*",

Know that the stillness of the profound tradition is the stillness of both body and mind—unattached and vast, roundly illuminating and thoroughly penetrating, like the light of a mirror or the moon in water. When both are still, not even the finest dust arises; when both illuminate, one enters layer upon layer. Like the lotus bearing dew, each drop forms a pearl—separation and union are unobstructed. Only by not clinging or abiding does this wondrous aspect appear. The profound tradition does not depart from emptiness and stillness, nor does it dwell in the subtlety of emptiness and stillness—it is thus, and this is called the Great Profound.\n\nThe principle of emptiness and stillness in Buddhism is known as *śamatha*. The *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* states: “If all bodhisattvas awaken to pure perfect enlightenment, and with a still, awakened mind take stillness as their practice, by clarifying all thoughts, they recognize the disturbance of discriminating consciousness. Still wisdom arises, and the adventitious dust of body and mind is forever extinguished. Thereupon, inner tranquility and light ease emerge. Through this tranquility, the hearts of all tathāgatas in the ten directions manifest within, like images in a mirror. This expedient means is called *śamatha*.” It further states: “If all bodhisattvas take only supreme stillness, by the power of stillness they forever sever afflictions and ultimately attain accomplishment. Without rising from their seats, they enter nirvana. Such bodhisattvas are called those who cultivate *śamatha* alone.” The *Avataṃsaka Sutra’s* “Chapter on the Ten Samādhis” states: “Abiding in *śamatha*, most tranquil, ever dwelling in the one mark—namely, the markless.”\n\nThe stillness of the profound tradition is precisely entered through *śamatha*, transcending a single gate to emerge upon the adorned path, sharing the same enjoyment as all buddhas and bodhisattvas. Layman Pang said: “In stillness, one sees the true suchness of nature.” The *Classic of the Unseen* states: “The Dao of nature is still,” and “Supreme stillness is the essence of integrity.” *Zhuangzi* says: “Rectitude leads to stillness; stillness arises from clarity; clarity leads to non-action, yet nothing is left undone.” Thus, both immortals and buddhas cultivate through emptiness and stillness to return to their original nature, aligning with the true and constant Dao.\n\n---\n\n62. The Purity of the Infant\n\nLaozi said: “Carrying your *po* and embracing the One—can you never part from it? Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?” This teaches one to unite mind and breath, harmonizing qi and breath, sleeping without sound, just like an infant. He further said: “The multitude bustle about, as if feasting at a great sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace. I alone remain tranquil, showing no sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.” And again: “One whose virtue is profoundly accumulated is like a newborn babe. Poisonous insects do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, birds of prey do not strike it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm. It does not know the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—this is the perfection of essence. It cries all day without its throat becoming hoarse—this is the perfection of harmony.”\n\nLaozi repeatedly teaches one to emulate the infant, for it holds a profound meaning. First, the infant has no cunning mind, free from distinctions of right and wrong, high and low, great and small. Second, the infant is supple and soft—Laozi’s words: “In human life, one is soft and weak; in death, one is stiff and strong. The soft and weak are companions of life; the stiff and strong are companions of death.” Third, the infant does not contend—Laozi said: “The Dao of the sage is to act without contending,” and “Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.” The virtue of non-contention is emphasized three times in the *Five Thousand Words*. Fourth, the infant has no lustful desires, seeing form yet not as form, pure and serene. Fifth, the infant embraces the One, guarding only spirit and qi, harmonizing mind and breath, sleeping at night without sound, able to resonate with heaven and earth’s true yang. Those who study the Dao should be like this. Sixth, the infant has no sense of self or others, no clinging mind, muddled and unaware, forgetting things and cares, knowing only to eat when hungry and sleep when tired. Those who embody the Dao must be thus. Therefore, the virtues of the infant are held up for emulation.\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into Laozi* states: “The ancients who cultivated the self concealed and accumulated virtue, deep and unexposed, thus they were often compared to newborn babes.”",

      "translated_text": "The sutra states: *\"Carrying the soul and embracing the One.\"* Profit and harm do not intrude, thus venomous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and predatory birds do not strike. Since the mind harbors no scheming, external things do not respond with scheming intent. Moreover, though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grip remains firm—why? Because the essence is perfect. When essence is whole, qi naturally concentrates, thus the grip is firm, and the mechanism operates in due time, without command yet spontaneously. Though crying all day, the throat does not grow hoarse—why? Because harmony is perfect. When qi is harmonious, the voice remains rounded. Yet know this: the harmony of qi arises from the spirit remaining unharmed. Excessive joy, fear, sorrow, or anger—if one cries thus, the spirit and qi are both injured before the day is done. When essence and harmony converge, this is the virtue of the infant. Those who embody profound virtue are likewise. Therefore, constantly embrace the primordial and guard the One, concentrate qi to utmost softness, so that one’s harmonious qi flows in communion with heaven and earth. Then the root of nature remains whole, the stem of life secure, and the unchanging Dao of true constancy resides within.\n\n*The Precious Mirror Samādhi of the Cave School* states: *\"Like a worldly infant, the five aspects complete.

Gentle and harmonious, with phrases yet without phrases.\"*\n\nMaster Yuanwu said: *\"Whether form or fragrance, all is penetrated at once—only then is it called the realm of no-mind. Cultivate until resembling an infant: pure harmony and tranquil simplicity. Though amidst worldly toil, worldly dust does not stain. Though dwelling in serene wonder, serenity cannot hold one back. In movement and action, all is effortlessly free. Roots, dust, birth, death—realm and wisdom are empty and wondrous. Like hot water melting snow, one always knows the time, without excess—this is the person of no-mind.\"*\n\nAfter the *Sage Conduct* and *Brahmā Conduct* chapters in the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, the *Infant Conduct Chapter* follows, stating: *\"Good son, why is it called infant conduct? The good son cannot arise, abide, come, go, or speak—this is infant conduct. The Tathāgata is likewise: ‘Cannot arise’ means the Tathāgata never arises in the marks of dharmas. ‘Cannot abide’ means the Tathāgata does not cling to any dharmas. ‘Cannot come’ means the Tathāgata’s bodily actions are without movement. ‘Cannot go’ means the Tathāgata has reached great nirvāṇa. ‘Cannot speak’ means though the Tathāgata expounds dharmas for all beings, in truth nothing is said. Further, the infant does not know suffering or joy, day or night, father or mother. The bodhisattva mahāsattva is likewise: for the sake of beings, they do not perceive suffering or joy, have no marks of day or night, and toward all beings, their mind is equal—thus they have no marks of father, mother, intimacy, or estrangement, serving as an analogy for the Tathāgata’s conduct. Further, the infant cannot undertake great or small affairs; the bodhisattva mahāsattva is likewise, no longer creating karmic actions in saṃsāra—this is called ‘not creating.’\"* The sutra extensively illustrates the marks of infant conduct to analogize the Tathāgata’s conduct, perfectly aligning with the Lao Sage’s principle of returning to the infant.\n\nThe Mystic School’s teaching of reverting to the child’s body is precisely the practice of returning to the infant. After seven days passing the great kalpa of heaven, the roots of lust, the mind of lust, and the mechanism of lust are all uprooted, restoring primordial purity—thus attaining the Dao becomes effortless. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s ten abodes include the *Abode of Primordial Purity*. Mañjuśrī, the teacher of seven buddhas, is uniquely called the *Bodhisattva Youth*—this too shares the same principle.\n\n*The Meaning of Mahāyāna* states: *\"Infant conduct has two types. Regarding self-benefit, it is named by analogy: conduct free from discrimination, like an infant who accomplishes nothing—this is infant conduct. Regarding benefiting others, it is named for those being transformed: as the sutra says, ordinary beings, śrāvakas, and beginning bodhisattvas resemble infants; transforming these infants is called infant conduct.\"*\n\nBoth the immortal and buddha traditions use the infant to illustrate the cultivator’s practice. However, the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* shows the marks but not the practice. The Lao Sage not only demonstrates returning to the infant but also reveals the principle of concentrating qi to softness and embracing the One without departure—comprehension, understanding, practice, and realization are all complete. Truly, this is the guiding principle of profound cultivation and the precious raft for transcending birth and death.\n\n---\n\n**Sixty-Three: The Virtue of Primal Chaos**\n\nPrimal chaos is the state before yin and yang separate, before black and white divide—a realm of seamless indistinction, where function is forgotten in wondrous perfection. In the Dao, it is the *Great Mystery*, the *Ultimateless*, the *Chaotic Darkness*, the *Prior to the Emperor of Images*. In Buddhism, it is *Before the Sound of Might*; in Confucianism, the *Great Ease*. According to Dongshan’s five ranks of merit, it is the *Merit of Merit*; in the five ranks of correct and partial, it is the *Position of Simultaneous Middle Arrival*. Principle and phenomena merge without trace—this is the ultimate of the Dao.\n\nThus Dongshan said: *\"Seamless, with no need for concealment—beyond this, nothing to seek.\"* Caoshan said: *\"Seamless, without inside or outside, harmonious and level above and below.\"* And again: *\"Seamless, concealing principle and phenomena—its signs are utterly obscure. Before the King of Might’s sound, how could Maitreya awaken?\"* Dongshan’s verse states: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—who dares harmonize without falling into being or non-being? Everyone wishes to escape the common stream, yet in the end, they fold back and sit in the ashes.\"*\n\nMaster Lu’s verse says: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—the tongueless child truly knows the Dao. Where to brush away dust to meet the source? Letting go and returning, the path regains its wonder.\"*\n\nHongzhi said: *\"Simultaneous Middle Arrival—the Dipper’s handle slants, the sky not yet dawn. The crane’s dream awakens to dew on leaves, cold; from the old nest, it flies into the clouds and pines.\"*",
      "overlap_context": " the Dao should be like this. Sixth, the infant has no sense of self or others, no clinging mind, muddled and unaware, forgetting things and cares, knowing only to eat when hungry and sleep when tired. Those who embody the Dao must be thus. Therefore, the virtues of the infant are held up for emulation.\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into Laozi* states: “The ancients who cultivated the self concealed and accumulated virtue, deep and unexposed, thus they were often compared to newborn babes.”",

He saw an old man working in his vegetable garden. Zigong asked, ‘What are you doing?’ The man replied, ‘I am a disciple of Confucius.’ The gardener said, ‘Are you not the one who broadly studies to emulate the sages, who struts about to overshadow the masses, who plays the lone lute and sings dirges to sell your name throughout the world? You will forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your body—how can you hope for that? If you cannot govern yourself, how can you govern the world?’ Zigong shrank back, dismayed, and felt uneasy for thirty *li* before recovering. Returning to Lu, he told Confucius. Confucius said, ‘He is one who falsely practices the arts of the Chaos Clan. He knows one but not two, governs the inner but not the outer. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who is inactive and returns to the uncarved, who embodies nature and embraces spirit, wandering among the vulgar—how could you not be startled?

      "original_text": "’日凿一窍，七日而混沌死。 ” 《庄子》内七篇，以此作结，其旨深矣。 七日而混沌死者，盖混沌乃先天无极境界，离心意识分情量。 若六根用事，六识纷然，则落于后天见闻之中，非《大易》“用九，见群龙无首”之象矣。 又倏与忽乃心与息，心息合一，臻于大定。 定久，内外混忘，根尘俱泯，是为混沌。 藏心息于混沌，玄宗归根复命之学也。 洞山颂云：“头角才生已不堪，拟心求佛好羞惭。 迢迢空劫无人识，肯向南询五十三。 ”头角才生，即群龙有首，根尘纷起。 迢迢空劫，正先天无极，混沌鸿蒙，无始无终，无几无时之境。 《大易》“群龙无首”之象，老氏复归于无极之妙证也。 玄宗丹法，集成于《参同契》。 《契》曰：“混沌相交结，权舆树根基。 ”此谓阴阳交合，入于混沌。 混沌乃生天生地生人之根源也，而丹基正树于此。 吕祖所谓“真诀谁知藏混沌”是也。 《契》又曰：“圣人揆度，参序元基，四者（即乾坤坎离，亦即两重天地四个阴阳也）混沌，径入虚无。 ”此谓先后天冥合，返于混沌之乡，凝结于虚无之谷。 此混沌虚无，即是元基。 元基者，玄牝之机也。 《契》又云：“晦朔之间，合符行中。 混沌洪蒙，牝牡相从。 滋液润泽，施化流通。 天地神明，不可度量。 利用安身，隐形而藏。 ”此谓混沌洪蒙，乃日月合璧之际，圣人于此安身，洗心退藏于密，如羚羊挂角，无迹可寻。 一切天地神灵，不可测度，最为玄妙。 此作丹之枢纽，仙化之洪炉也。 以上略举玄禅二宗丹经子书，阐扬混沌之渊微。 自结丹以至脱胎，无时无刻，不在混沌之中。 学者诚能身体而力行之，返还之道，思过半矣。 六十四   重玄之奥 老子《道德经》云：“无名天地之始，有名万物之母。 故常无欲以观其妙； 常有欲以观其徼； 此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。 玄之又玄，众妙之门。 ” 盖无乃理法界，有乃事法界。 即无以观有（妙有也），即有以观无（真空也），有无交彻，乃事理无碍法界，具华严四法界也，契《心经》色空不二之旨，已入大乘般若之门矣。 玄之又玄，示重玄之境。 如千灯一室，光影重重，涉入交参，周遍含融，契华严宗因陀罗网境界，即事事无碍法界是也。 此重玄法门，一中含无量，无量复入一。 老圣但举其名，未揭其义。 若以华严宗十玄义释之，则妙理自显。 所谓十玄者，一、同时具足相应门； 二、广狭无碍自在门； 三、一多相容不同门； 四、诸法相即自在门； 五、秘密显隐俱成门； 六、微细相容安乐门； 七、因陀罗网境界门； 八、托事显法生解门； 九、十世隔法异成门； 十、主伴圆明具德门。 具如《华严悬谈》所说，兹就因陀罗网境界一门而言，《华藏品偈》云：“华藏世界所有尘，一一尘中见法界。 ”清凉疏云：“一一微尘中，各现无边刹海； 刹海之中，复有微尘。 彼诸尘内，复有刹海。 如是重重，不可穷尽，非是心识思量境界。 如天帝殿，珠网覆上，一明珠内，万象俱现，珠珠皆尔。 此珠明彻，互相现影。 影复现影，而无穷尽。 亦如镜灯，重重交光，佛佛无尽。 ” 准此而言，老圣重玄之门，乃妙中含窍，窍中含妙。 此窍妙之中，又各各复含妙窍，重重无尽，玄玄难穷。",
      "translated_text": "Daily they bored one aperture, and after seven days, Chaos died.\"\n\nThe *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi* conclude with this passage, its purport profound indeed. That Chaos died after seven days signifies that Chaos represents the primordial, boundless state prior to Heaven, beyond the divisions of heart, intent, and discriminating consciousness. When the six roots become active and the six senses scatter, one falls into the posterior realm of perception and knowledge—no longer the *Book of Changes*’ image of \"using the nine, beholding the flock of dragons without a head.\"\n\nMoreover, Shu and Hu are the heart and the breath. When heart and breath unite, one attains great stillness. With stillness prolonged, inner and outer merge and are forgotten, roots and dust both extinguished—this is Chaos. Concealing heart and breath within Chaos is the esoteric teaching of the Mysterious School, the art of returning to the root and restoring the mandate.\n\nThe *Song of Dongshan* says:\n*\"No sooner do horns appear than they are unbearable—\nTo seek the Buddha with the mind brings only shame.\nThrough endless kalpas, none have known,\nWho would inquire of the fifty-three in the south?\"*\n\nThe moment horns appear is when the flock of dragons has a head, when roots and dust arise. The endless kalpas are precisely the primordial, boundless Chaos, the vast primeval mist—timeless, beginningless, without measure or duration. This is the image of \"the flock of dragons without a head\" in the *Book of Changes*, the wondrous proof of Laozi’s return to the boundless.\n\nThe esoteric alchemical arts of the Mysterious School are compiled in the *Triplex Unity*. The *Unity* states:\n*\"Chaos intertwines and binds,\nThe first sprouts plant the root’s foundation.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the union of yin and yang, entering into Chaos. Chaos is the source that generates Heaven, Earth, and humanity, and the foundation of the elixir is planted therein. As Ancestor Lü said: *\"Who knows the true secret hidden in Chaos?\"*\n\nThe *Unity* further states:\n*\"The sage measures and orders the primal foundation.\nThe four (that is, Qian, Kun, Kan, Li—twofold Heaven and Earth, fourfold yin and yang) merge into Chaos,\nDirectly entering the void.\"*\n\nThis describes the fusion of prior and posterior Heaven, the return to the homeland of Chaos, the coagulation in the valley of the void. This Chaos and void are the primal foundation—the mechanism of the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe *Unity* also says:\n*\"Between dark and new moon, the tally aligns at the center.\nChaos and vast obscurity—\nThe female and male follow one another.\nNourishing fluids moisten and enrich,\nBestowing transformation and flowing through.\nThe numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth\nCannot be fathomed.\nUse it to secure the body,\nConceal the form and hide.\"*\n\nThis speaks of Chaos and vast obscurity as the moment when sun and moon conjoin. The sage secures the body therein, washing the heart and retiring into secrecy—like the antelope hanging its horns, leaving no trace. All the spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot plumb its depths; it is most wondrous. This is the pivot of elixir-making, the great furnace of immortal transformation.\n\nThe above briefly cites the alchemical classics and Chan texts of the Mysterious and Zen schools to expound the profundities of Chaos. From the formation of the elixir to the shedding of the embryo, there is no moment, no instant, that is not within Chaos. If scholars can embody and diligently practice this, the Way of return is more than half understood.\n\n---\n\nThe Profundities of the Double Mystery\n\nLaozi’s *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, constantly without desire, observe its mystery;\nConstantly with desire, observe its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name,\nTogether called the Mystery.\nMystery upon mystery—\nThe gateway of the manifold wonders.\"*\n\nThe \"without\" is the Dharma-realm of principle; the \"with\" is the Dharma-realm of phenomena. Through the without, observe the with (the wondrous existent); through the with, observe the without (true emptiness). When with and without interpenetrate, this is the Dharma-realm of unimpeded principle and phenomena—encompassing the four Dharma-realms of the *Avataṃsaka*, in accord with the *Heart Sutra*’s principle of non-duality of form and emptiness, having already entered the gateway of Mahāyāna prajñā.\n\n\"Mystery upon mystery\" reveals the realm of the Double Mystery. Like a thousand lamps in a single chamber, light and shadow layer upon layer, intermingling and interpenetrating, pervading and containing all—matching the *Avataṃsaka* school’s Indra’s Net realm, which is the Dharma-realm of unimpeded phenomena.\n\nThis gateway of the Double Mystery contains the one within the infinite, and the infinite again within the one. The Old Sage merely named it, without disclosing its meaning. If interpreted through the *Avataṃsaka* school’s Ten Profound Principles, the wondrous truth becomes self-evident.\n\nThe Ten Profound Principles are:\n1. The Gate of Simultaneous and Complete Correspondence;\n2. The Gate of Unimpeded Freedom in Vastness and Narrowness;\n3. The Gate of Mutual Containment of the One and the Many;\n4. The Gate of Unimpeded Identity of All Dharmas;\n5. The Gate of Secret and Manifest Co-actualization;\n6. The Gate of Subtle Containment and Bliss;\n7. The Gate of Indra’s Net Realm;\n8. The Gate of Displaying Dharmas through Phenomena to Generate Understanding;\n9. The Gate of the Ten Times Interpenetrating Different Dharmas;\n10. The Gate of the Principal and Companions Perfectly Illuminating All Virtues.\n\nAs expounded in the *Avataṃsaka Suspension of Doubts*, taking the Indra’s Net realm as an example, the *Flower Garland Sutra*’s verse says:\n*\"All the dusts in the Flower Treasury world—\nIn each and every dust, the Dharma-realm is seen.\"*\n\nMaster Qingliang’s commentary states:\n*\"In each and every mote of dust, the boundless realms of lands appear;\nWithin those lands of realms, motes of dust again arise.\nWithin those dusts, realms of lands once more appear—\nLayer upon layer, inexhaustible, beyond the reach of thought and cognition.\nLike the pearl-net in the palace of the Heavenly Emperor,\nWithin a single bright pearl, all images are reflected;\nEach pearl is thus, luminous and clear,\nMutually reflecting shadows, shadows reflecting shadows—endlessly.\nLike mirrors and lamps, light intermingling layer upon layer,\nBuddha upon Buddha, infinite.\"*\n\nBy this standard, the Old Sage’s gateway of the Double Mystery contains wonders within apertures and apertures within wonders. Within these apertures and wonders, each again contains wonders and apertures—layer upon layer, boundless, the mysteries unfathomable.",
      "overlap_context": "led, chaotic, they never depart from it.

      "translated_text": "One encompasses all, and all encompass one—\nthe one and the many mutually contain each other,\nsimultaneously and perfectly fulfilled.\nThus is it called the gateway of all wonders.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* speaks of \"layered radiance, layered splendor,\"\nwhich shares the same meaning as the Old Sage’s gateway of the Double Mystery.\nYet Confucianism and Daoism merely name it,\nwhile the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* of the Buddha’s tradition\nfully reveals its realm—\nthere is, indeed, a difference in depth and detail.\n\nOver two thousand years, over a hundred scholars have annotated the *Laozi*,\nbut those who could expound the wonder of the Double Mystery\nand use it to illuminate the boundless pearl-net of the *Avataṃsaka*’s Dharmadhātu—\nsuch minds are as rare as morning stars.\nTruly, the difficulty of true insight is evident.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Laozi* by Heshang Gong, though spuriously attributed,\nat least hints at the gateway of the Double Mystery.\nHis annotation reads:\n*\"Mystery (xuan) is Heaven.\nMystery upon mystery (xuan zhi you xuan) means Heaven within Heaven.\"*\nThe Song-dynasty Chan master Yongming Yanshou,\nin his *Record of the Source-Mirror*,\ncited this passage to reveal the wonder of the *Daodejing*.\nYet how lamentable that the Qingliang Chengguan National Preceptor,\nin his *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka*,\nvehemently disparaged the teachings of Laozi,\nequating them with the views of ordinary outsiders,\nand failed to recognize this saying of \"Heaven within Heaven\"\nas proof of the *Avataṃsaka*’s boundless pearl-net of wonders.\nDoes this not contradict the intent of the Third Patriarch Xincan’s teaching:\n*\"Harmonizing the mind in equality,\nall dharmas viewed as one,\nnon-duality all-inclusive,\nnothing left unembraced?\"*\n\n---\n\n**§65 The Subtlety of Double Emptiness**\n\nThe *Daodejing* opens the gateway of the Double Mystery;\nthe *Nanhua Jing* (Zhuangzi) reveals the profundity of Double Emptiness.\nDouble Mystery is the meaning of the *Avataṃsaka*;\nDouble Emptiness is the meaning of *Prajñā*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter states:\n*\"Emerging without origin, entering without aperture.\nThere is reality yet no place to abide,\nthere is extension yet no boundary to sever—\nsomething emerges yet has no aperture.\"*\nThis \"reality\" marks the meaning of true emptiness.\n\nFurther on, it says:\n*\"There is life, there is death,\nthere is emergence, there is entry.\nEntering and emerging without seeing its form—\nthis is called the Heavenly Gate.\nThe Heavenly Gate is non-being;\nall things emerge from non-being.\nBeing cannot generate being from being;\nit must emerge from non-being.\nYet even non-being is not a fixed non-being—\nthe sage abides in this.\"*\nHere, the Heavenly Gate signifies emptiness.\nWhen practice reaches the point where thought and breath both cease,\nperson and dharma are both extinguished,\ninner and outer both empty—\none enters the Heavenly Gate.\nYet if one clings to the trace of emptiness,\neven emptiness becomes something.\nThus, one must empty the appearance of emptiness,\nso that even \"non-being\" is no more—\nthis is the stage of Double Emptiness.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states:\n*\"Emptiness, awareness, and quiescence are perfectly round;\nthe emptiness that empties emptiness is extinguished.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"When this root first awakens,\none first attains emptiness of the person.\nThe nature of emptiness becomes perfectly luminous,\nachieving liberation from dharmas.\nOnce liberated from dharmas,\nboth are empty and unarisen—\nthis is called the samādhi of the bodhisattva,\nattaining the patience of non-arising.\"*\nThis deeply accords with the *Zhuangzi*’s teaching of Double Emptiness.\n\nObserving Laozi’s Double Mystery,\none deeply enters the *Avataṃsaka*’s infinite gateway.\nObserving Zhuangzi’s Double Emptiness,\none deeply accords with the *Prajñā*’s teaching of no-form.\nThus, the subtle words of Laozi and Zhuangzi\nand the mind-essence of the Buddhas\nmerge like water and milk,\nresonating like a seal and its impression—\nthere is no doubt of this.\n\nYet it is strange that the Qingliang Chengguan National Preceptor,\nin his *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka*,\ncondemned Laozi and Zhuangzi as external paths\nand failed to cite the principles of Double Emptiness and Double Mystery\nto mutually illuminate them.\nEven later works like Zhao Yandu’s *Unity of Immortals and Buddhas* (Yuan dynasty)\nand Wu Chongxu’s *Convergence of Immortals and Buddhas* (Ming dynasty)\ncould not employ these principles to achieve fusion.\nThus, the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi have remained obscure in the world for over two thousand years.\n\nDouble Mystery and Double Emptiness\nare the subtle wonders of quiescence and illumination in mutual fusion.\nDouble Mystery is expounded from the side of illumination;\nDouble Emptiness, from the side of quiescence.\n\nThe *Profound Discourse on the Avataṃsaka* states:\n*\"When mind and realm are thusness,\nthey are equal and unimpeded.\nThe Buddha who understands the realm through mind,\nthe Tathāgata who sees only mind in the realm—\nmind and Buddha are layer upon layer,\nyet the nature of original awakening is one.\nAll are grasped yet unattainable—\nthus mind and realm are both forgotten.\nIlluminated yet unfathomable—\nthus principle and wisdom interpenetrate.\"*\nForgetting both is the realization of true emptiness;\ninterpenetration is the manifestation of wondrous being.\nThis is how the Heavenly Gate and the gateway of all wonders are established.\n\nFrom the perspective of perfect fusion:\nLaozi’s teaching reveals that wonder and aperture are one in mystery—\nthus, being is also mystery, and non-being is also mystery.\nEven \"non-being within non-being\" is the gateway of Double Mystery,\nthough here it is spoken from the perspective of the empty Tathāgata-garbha.\nThe *Avataṃsaka*’s Ten Mysteries\nare expounded from the perspective of the non-empty Tathāgata-garbha.\n\nIf a practitioner realizes the one mind\nand thoroughly fathoms the source of dharmas,\nboth the empty and non-empty Tathāgata-garbha are revealed.\nThis is what Qingliang meant by:\n*\"With the mind that knows quiescence as non-dual,\none accords with the Middle Way of empty and being in dual fusion.\"*\n\nSomeone may ask:\nIs there a sequence between Double Mystery and Double Emptiness?\n\nThe answer:\nQingliang said:\n*\"When both are forgotten in realization,\nwondrous awakening becomes perfectly luminous.\"*\nThus, only when one accords with Double Emptiness\ndoes the gateway of Double Mystery open.\nThen, the large appears within the small,\nthe small appears within the large—\nwondrous functions layer upon layer,\ndeeply entering the *Avataṃsaka*’s infinite gateway.\n\n---\n\n**§66 The Path of the Bird**\n\nA bird flies through the sky without leaving a trace—\nthis is called the path of the bird.\nZhuangzi called it the \"bird’s flight.\"\n\nWhen mind and breath depend on emptiness,\nsettle in emptiness,\nand forget in emptiness,\nnot clinging to the bodily form—\nis this not the wondrous practice of the bird’s path?\n\nThus, Li Qing’an’s *Song of Cultivating Emptiness* says:\n*\"Within emptiness, the spirit is at peace, within emptiness it moves.\nThe hidden emptiness—heaven and earth all return to it.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ght pearl, all images are reflected;\nEach pearl is thus, luminous and clear,\nMutually reflecting shadows, shadows reflecting shadows—endlessly.\nLike mirrors and lamps, light intermingling layer upon layer,\nBuddha upon Buddha, infinite.\"*\n\nBy this standard, the Old Sage’s gateway of the Double Mystery contains wonders within apertures and apertures within wonders. Within these apertures and wonders, each again contains wonders and apertures—layer upon layer, boundless, the mysteries unfathomable.",

      "translated_text": "**§66 The Path of the Bird (continued)**\n\nZen Master Zuan of Zu’an said:\n*\"The wondrous, empty bird’s path leaves no speck of dust;\njade halls stand vacant, locked in emerald moss.\nA shuttle hangs on the wall—autumn sheds its bones;\nthe old oyster in the deep sea broods by day.\"*\n\nZen Master Jue of Tiantong said:\n*\"Sandbirds roost at night in trees by the blue shore;\nstone shoots pierce fresh through the moss of ancient paths.\nDo not say the leviathan lacks wings—\ntoday it returns along the bird’s path.\"*\n\nA monk asked Zen Master Jia of Dongshan, *\"The Master often teaches people to walk the bird’s path. What is the bird’s path?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Not encountering a single person.\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"How does one walk it?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Simply go with no selfishness in your step.\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"Is walking the bird’s path itself the original face?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Why is the Venerable so confused?\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"How am I confused?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"If you were not confused, why would you call a servant ‘master’?\"*\nThe monk asked, *\"What is the original face?\"*\nThe Master said, *\"Not walking the bird’s path.\"*\n\nZen Master Hong of Li’an said:\n*\"Not walking the bird’s path—only then is it the original face.\nWhy, then, does one usually teach people to walk the bird’s path?\nI ask: What did Dongshan mean?\"*\nAfter a long pause, he said:\n*\"To cross the river, one needs a raft;\nonly upon reaching the shore does one leave the boat.\"*\n\nZen Master Qi of Fengshan said:\n*\"I ask: What is the face of not walking the bird’s path?\"*\nAfter a long pause, he said:\n*\"I would not refuse to tell you,\nbut to continue it is most difficult.\"*\n\nZen Master Chun of Danxia said:\n*\"The ancient path leans freely on the great void;\nwalking it is still to tread rough terrain.\nNot ascending the bird’s path may be wondrous,\nbut upon examination, one still traverses the way.\"*\n\nZen Master Zhi of Moli said:\n*\"Not walking the bird’s path—\nthe imperial wind blows vast.\nWhat does the old nag know?\nDrunk in the celestial streets,\n‘What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?’\"*\n\nZen Master Jue of Tiantong said:\n*\"The six gates open freely, the path is not lost;\nin the light of the great sun, one does not seize the moment.\nEven if one models wondrous display without selfish intent,\njust so does one return along the bird’s path.\"*\n\nI note: Walking the bird’s path is returning home by way. Not walking the bird’s path is sitting steadily at home. Walking the bird’s path remains within the stage of merit; not walking the bird’s path is the stage beyond merit and its fruition.\n\nWhen a practitioner first cultivates merit, mind and breath are placed in the emptiness outside the body, interdependent and continuous as if present—spirit harmonized, qi settled, naturally attuned. This is the stage of merit. When merit is pure and effort exhausted, suddenly spirit and breath are both forgotten, entering great stillness. Mind and realm are both quiescent, person and dharma both empty, inner and outer both dissolved—only then does one enter the original position.\n\nWhat is meant by *\"the six gates open freely\"*? The six senses enter deep stillness, the six consciousnesses do not arise—this is precisely the moment of turning merit into position. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the first yang returns; in the midst of vagueness, a transformation occurs in the profound darkness. One must swiftly turn the mysterious pass, so that mind and breath again interdepend outside—this is turning position into merit. Depending thus, one enters stillness again, neither exiting nor entering, forgetting form and image, thereby entering the samādhi of no-mind. Detached from the body, without reliance—this is again turning merit into position.\n\nIn this process, whether walking or stopping, one does not miss the moment. Within this turning wheel, all is the subtle mechanism of the bird’s path. Only when one reaches Zhuangzi’s *\"realm of no walking\"* is one truly on the path; only when one attains the level of *\"shattering empty space\"* is one fully transcendent.\n\n---\n\n**§67 The Sign of the Sparrow’s Egg**\n\nLongmeizi’s *Poem Verifying the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"Like a sparrow’s egg, round and full,\nor a black pearl, perfectly spherical.\nThe dragon child, having shed its skin, is swallowed—\nthis body has already attained the immortal who walks on land.\"*\n\nShangyangzi said:\n*\"When the medicine enters the mouth, one circulates one’s true fire to nurture it. While circulating the fire, one suddenly feels the true qi at the spine rising to strike the mud-pill palace, with a trickling sound, as if something touches the brain. Momentarily, like sparrow’s eggs, one by one, it enters the throat below the tower, cool as ice, sweet as cream, incomparably fragrant and delicious. When one perceives this state, it is the verification of the golden liquid returning elixir. Thereafter, it is unceasing. Closing the eyes to inwardly observe the viscera, they are as clear as if illuminated by a candle. Gradually, a golden light envelops the body.\"*\n\nZiyang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The maiden passes through the southern garden,\nholding a jade olive in her hand.\"*\n\nZhuokuiyun’s *Direct Explanation* says:\n*\"‘Jade’ symbolizes its whiteness; ‘olive’ symbolizes its neither-square-nor-round shape.\"*\n\nThis is a vivid and precise inner vision, imbued with profound meaning by the immortals.\n\nNiniuweng said:\n*\"The three yangs’ maiden plays with bright pendants.\"*\n\nZixianweng said:\n*\"It is also like a golden silkworm or a jade shoot.\"*\n\nTheir meanings are the same.\n\nI note: The jade shoot, jade olive, bright pendants, and sparrow’s eggs are all inner visions of obtaining the elixir. Where jade is hidden in the mountains, peaks become elegant and waters graceful, and plants and trees do not wither. When the elixir is formed within the body, the body radiates luster, bones become like fine jade, form is transformed and substance altered, the turbid becomes pure, the coarse becomes wondrous—attaining the Dao and becoming a true one is not difficult.\n\nThis sparrow’s egg and jade shoot are the primordial qi, refined by the fire of samādhi, coalescing into this form. They have appearance but no substance—merely a mass of original yang’s luminous qi. Even if one were to dissect the physical body, there would still be nothing. For the primordial qi is subtle and wondrous beyond compare. Only when the practitioner, in samādhi, observes with the eye of wisdom can it be seen—it is never visible to the ordinary eye.\n\n---\n\n**§68 The Auspice of the Red Sun**\n\nWhen the great elixir first congeals, the image of a red sun suspended in the sky appears before one’s eyes.",

Suspended at its center is the primordial medicine—from afar like a grape, up close like gold.\"*\n\nThe *Wugen Shu* (\"Rootless Tree\") states: *\"Rootless tree, its blossoms crimson bright—pluck all the red flowers, and the tree stands empty.\"* And again: *\"Like a ruby orange, like a pellet shot, guard and tend it, never let it stray.\"* Patriarch Hanxu commented: *\"The red is the symbolic manifestation of the great medicine. The immortal masters’ verses on the Daoist sentiment and the Rootless Tree are both essential works—from one, the other may be understood. When the red glow appears, its blossom is truly crimson. When the red blossom is grasped, the true medicine is obtained. Apart from this red blossom, no medicine can be gathered. Once the great elixir matures, this red blossom transforms into a purple hue, becoming purple light and purple qi.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang’s Daoist name, Ziyang (\"Purple Yang\"), alludes to this very symbolic manifestation. When the Old Sage was about to emerge from seclusion, Guan Yin instructed him to observe the celestial signs at night. From afar, he saw purple qi approaching from the east and knew that a great sage would pass through at dawn—soon after, the Old Sage indeed arrived. When Patriarch Lü wandered to Huanglong Mountain, he saw purple clouds forming a canopy and knew a sage dwelled there. Upon entering, he met Chan Master Huanglong Huiji ascending the hall, and through his words, Lü attained sudden awakening, completing the final step.\n\nNote that red is the precursor to purple, and purple is the ultimate transformation of red. Among the seven colors of light, purple is supreme. When the sage’s cultivation reaches the perfection of the great elixir, purple qi appears above the crown—elevated yet another level beyond the red glow of the elixir’s initial congealment. Thus, the *Four Hundred Characters* states: *\"Lead and mercury bind into cinnabar, its radiance a resplendent purple-gold.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Its color shifts further to purple, blazing forth as the returned elixir.\"* Master Sanfeng also said: *\"The two qi harmonize, transmuting into purple light.\"*\n\nIn the esoteric Buddhist text *Ekākṣara-Uṣṇīṣa-Cakra-Kālacakra-Sthāna-Vidhi*, it is written: *\"There, the Bhagavān, with the light of self-nature wisdom, forms the wheel of majestic solar radiance, illuminating all realms without remainder.\"* And again: *\"Again, behold the golden wheel, adorning the sun-wheel of the heart.\"* When the great elixir of the Daoist mystery school first congeals, the auspicious sign of a red sun suspended in the sky appears—is this not the purport of the heart’s adorned sun-wheel? Otherwise, what meaning could be drawn from the doctrine of the great solar wheel? Know that the golden wheel of Buddhism and the golden elixir of the mystery school are both inner-realized symbolic manifestations—there is no doubt of this.\n\n**§69 The Fragrance of Sweet Dew**\n\nThe Old Sage said: *\"When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends.\"* Master Ziyang remarked: *\"When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where the yellow sprout arises, Kan and Li intersect.\"* Patriarch Lü said: *\"White clouds ascend to the celestial gate, sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\"* And again: *\"Drive the green dragon, seize the white tiger, summon auspicious winds and descending sweet dew.\"* Master Yuchan declared: *\"When the magic fungus blooms, sweet dew descends; the tortoise and serpent eternally entwine.\"* Longmeizi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* states: *\"Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand beings; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: *\"I do not envy the beauty of delicate flowers, only await the sweet dew and nectarous spring.\"* And again: *\"The fragrance of sweet dew arises, sweet as honey; entering the jade pool, it transforms into golden liquid. Carefree, I drink the sweet dew as it falls.\"* And: *\"From the Niwan Palace descends ambrosial su, like a ruby orange brewing the wine of *tihu*. The *tihu* reaches the mouth like sweet dew.\"* And: *\"Primordial qi, the mist of supreme simplicity—one draught of *tihu* preserves the countenance.\"* And: *\"Daily, the *tihu* wine of longevity; hourly, swallowing the nectar that revives the soul.\"* And: *\"The *tihu* poured upon the crown is the true bellows and key, gathering the primordial qi of the One.\"* And: *\"Transformed into jade nectar, swallowed into the belly—like a mute tasting honey, beyond words.\"* And: *\"Drink the immortal wine of extended years, consume the jade nectar of renewed life.\"*\n\nMaster Niyuan’s *Purple Court Classic* states: *\"Gather and ingest it in an instant—a single white pulse surges through the Niwan. Transformed into jade liquid, it flows into the mouth, its fragrance and cool sweetness suffusing the tongue.\"* The *Cantong Qi* also says: *\"First, the golden blossom arises; in a moment, it dissolves into water, its horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.\"* And: *\"The three substances mutually embrace, their transformations wondrous as spirits. Below lies the qi of the great yang, steaming and seething in an instant. First liquid, then congealing, it is called the Yellow Chariot.\"* And again: *\"Transformed into white liquid, congealing into firmness.\"*\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Oral Exegesis* states: *\"Now, the primordial water-metal first arises at the moment of hexagramic movement—merely a single qi. In a brief span, half a watch, it crosses the Magpie Bridge, turns at Kunlun, dissolves into water, and is named *tihu* and sweet dew. Descending through the double towers, falling into the yellow palace, binding into the elixir, it takes the form of horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.\"* He also commented on Patriarch Lü’s *Hundred-Character Stele*: *\"The primordial qi is born at the time of hexagramic movement.\"*",

For the primordial qi is subtle and wondrous beyond compare. Only when the practitioner, in samādhi, observes with the eye of wisdom can it be seen—it is never visible to the ordinary eye.\n\n---\n\n**§68 The Auspice of the Red Sun**\n\nWhen the great elixir first congeals, the image of a red sun suspended in the sky appears before one’s eyes.",

      "translated_text": "At this moment, wielding the sword to pursue it, it crosses the Magpie Bridge, pierces the *weilü*, ascends along the Governing Vessel, and reaches the *Niwan*. One suddenly feels a smooth, billowing sensation, as if white clouds were ascending to the upper palace. In an instant, it transforms into jade nectar, its taste like sweet dew, sprinkling upon Mount Sumeru, descending through the double towers, entering the Central Palace—this is what is meant by \"qi returning and the elixir congealing,\" and such is its manifestation. It is also said: \"When qi transforms into water, nothing is as sweet and fine, hence the names *jade liquid* and *fine wine* are given as fitting.\" The above excerpts from the poems, words, and exegeses of ancient adepts illustrate the effects of the Daoist ancestral practice of qi circulating through the *zhou tian*.\n\nFor *tihu* and sweet dew, *jade liquid* and *fine wine*, are all transformations of the primordial, harmonious qi, serving as proof of \"Heaven’s One generating water\" and the meditative flavor of qi circulating through the *zhou tian*—this is called \"ingesting the Great Harmony.\" From this, the hundred vessels thaw like spring, the Three Fields are moistened, essence and qi fill the interior, and spirit-light radiates outward, until qi is full, fire ceases, and the Returned Elixir congeals.\n\n---\n\n**Seventy: The Strangeness of White Blood**\nIn the Daoist ancestral practice of return, after seven days and the completion of the great *zhou tian*, the blood throughout the body gradually transforms into white milk, presenting the phenomenon of \"shedding the old and renewing the crucible.\" Patriarch Lü said: \"Red blood changes, and white milk flows.\" He also said: \"Blood transforms into white cream, and the body becomes indestructible.\" Chen Cuixu stated: \"Though the toil lasts but ten months, gradually gathering and congealing, now the whole body is white blood, and one feels the four limbs free of cold and heat.\" Another poem reads: \"Golden light permeates the body, the marrow fragrant, sinews of gold and bones of jade—pure yang. Refining causes red blood to turn white, yin qi dissipates, and the body is naturally healthy.\" The Perfected One of True Yang said: \"Sometimes blood transforms into milk, and one gradually comes to loathe the rank and foul.\" The *Song of Breaking Delusion and Upholding the True Dao* also states: \"Blood turns to cream, the body like silver; truly, for a hundred days there is no loss, and jade cream flows, generating radiance.\"\n\nZhang Sanfeng’s *Explanation of the Verifications of Return* says: \"After six months of refinement, the body becomes like silver cream, blood transforms into white nectar, the whole body exudes a fragrant aroma, and the breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the maturation of the numinous elixir—a lump of dry mercury. One who ingests it will never die.\"\n\nI note that in modern times, with the flourishing of science, when human blood is observed under a microscope, it is found to contain two kinds of blood cells: red and white. The proportion of white blood cells is small, but their function is immense—they eliminate pathogens, resist cold, nourish the five viscera, and strengthen the body. Daoist ancestral practitioners, in stillness pushed to its extreme, sense the primordial True One’s qi entering their bodies, altering the composition of the blood and increasing the white blood cells. At its utmost, the red blood cells are entirely transformed into white, and thus blood becomes milk. This is the way of nurturing life through the primordial, beyond what those who focus solely on postnatal hygiene can attain.\n\nThat blood transforms into milk is merely a change within the physical body. The sensation of the four limbs being free of cold and heat indicates that the seventh consciousness has also been transformed. As body and mind subtly shift, these are all verifications of the Daoist ancestral methods of qi transforming and spirit transforming, possessing the effortless efficacy of \"water flowing to form a channel\"—this is the way of \"externally transforming the body.\"\n\nSome may ask: In Daoist ancestral cultivation and verification, blood transforming into milk is indeed so. But what of the Buddhist tradition? The answer is: If one attains the great stillness of no-breathing, within that stillness the primordial True One’s qi steams and suffuses the hundred vessels, irrigating the whole body—vast and boundless!—merging with the Great Nature. The Great Harmony overflows, shedding the old and renewing the crucible, and the blood naturally changes, yin exhausted and yang pure.\n\nIn the Chan tradition, when the twenty-fourth patriarch of the Western Heaven, the Venerable Lion, was killed by the king, white milk surged upward several feet. During the Zhou Emperor Wu’s suppression of Buddhism, the Dharma Master Jing’ai, having exhausted his efforts to remonstrate, entered the Zhongnan Mountains. Weeping for seven days, he sat upon a boulder, drew his blade, and sliced open his flesh, hanging his intestines and stomach upon a pine branch. Holding his heart, he died, and white milk flowed beside him, congealing upon the stone. These events are recorded in the classics and are clearly verifiable. They are all evident proofs of blood transforming into milk. Since the verifications of the physical body align, the states of the Dharma-body’s samādhi and wisdom are likewise equivalent—there can be no doubt.\n\n---\n\n**Seventy-One: The Wonder of Square Pupils**\nFormerly, the Queen Mother of the West said to Emperor Wu of Han: \"The practice of *benefiting and transforming* means constantly contemplating the *Numinous Treasure*. *Numinous* is spirit, and *Treasure* is essence. You need only cherish essence, hold it firmly, regulate the mind, and nurture qi. Qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, and essence into spirit. Practicing without weariness, spirit and essence become abundant. In one year, qi is transformed; in two years, blood; in three years, essence; in four years, the vessels; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the bones; in seven years, the sinews; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the body. When the body is transformed, the way of change and transformation is complete.\"\n\nThe way of externally transforming the body is what Daoist practice esteems, yet its verifications must arise gradually. First, qi is transformed, and last, the body. The sign of the body’s transformation lies in the transformation of the pupils. When the pupils transform, qi, blood, bones, and marrow are all transformed without exception.\n\nThe *Six Books* states: \"Humans receive qi to live, and the eyes are the first. Where spirit gathers, there are none but the eyes.\" Now, in practicing the way of *benefiting and transforming*, reversing the flow to be born beyond life and death, the pupils, which were last to transform, become square. Thus, square pupils are the culmination of bodily transformation and the symbolic verification of attaining the Dao.\n\nThe saying that immortals have square pupils was spoken of by Liu Xiang and Ge Hong in earlier times, and recounted by Su Shi and Song Lian in later times.",

His feet trod phoenixes, his stride outran swift steeds. To Yao’s gate he bestowed this divine formula—those who fulfill their nature may refuse it, while those of middling wisdom should embrace it.\" This is the earliest record of square pupils.\n\nGe Hong’s *On Immortals* in the *Baopuzi* states: \"If all were like those who verify it, they would have heard of the pupils’ perfect squareness.\" The *Subtle Principles* further says: \"If my eyes had square pupils and my ears extended beyond my crown, I would ride flying dragons and harness auspicious clouds, soaring past lightning to reach the inverted heavens—how then could you question me?\" The *Dispelling Doubts* chapter notes: \"The *Immortals’ Classics* say that the pupils of immortals are all square. In Luoyang, I met Bai Zhongli, who told me his pupils were perfectly square—truly, he was an extraordinary man.\"\n\nIn the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, volume ten of the *Biography of Li Gen*, it is written: \"Tai Wen also said that Li Gen’s two pupils were square. According to the *Immortals’ Classics*, those who live eight hundred years have square pupils.\"\n\nI once asked Master Wang why the pupils of immortals become square. He replied: \"It is the work of divine spirit. This transformation occurs only after refining the spirit to return to emptiness. Such is the verification of spiritual transformation, manifest in the eyes. The human spirit resides in the eyes, as the *Classic of Yin Convergence* says: 'The mechanism lies in the eyes.' If the heart-ground is opened and unobstructed, the eyes too will transform.\" I believe the eyes and heart are interconnected—if the heart remains unmoved as a mountain, the round pupils will turn square. Roundness is the image of movement; squareness, the image of stillness. The *Book of Changes*, in the second line of the *Kun* hexagram, speaks of \"straight, square, and great\"—this can serve as proof. Square pupils are the auspicious sign of immortals, the verification of spiritual transformation, and the culmination of bodily refinement.\n\nGrand Preceptor Wu once encountered Li Zuhanxu in an ancient temple in Xi’an. Seeing his pupils were perfectly square, he recognized him as an immortal, bowed in reverence, and sought the mysteries of the Dao. Ultimately, he too attained realization. This is another modern verification of square pupils.\n\nSu Shi’s poem *For Wang Yi, Departing for Fuzhou* reads:\n*\"Long ago I knew you in Wugong,\nShared wine and night talk in the cold quarters.\nWhen wine ran out and candles burned low, words still flowed,\nWhile weary servants dozed, stiff as folding screens.\nYou urged me to learn the deathless art,\nSaying you’d received it from a square-pupiled elder.\"*\n\nSong Lian of the Ming dynasty wrote: \"Traveling in Jiangnan, I met Zhou Yuanzhen (styled Yuanchu) on Phoenix Terrace. His square pupils gleamed, his long brows bristled, and he gazed with disdain upon all things below. I secretly thought he must be an immortal from Mount Gou, descending on a crane while playing the sheng.\"\n\nThe *History of Divine Immortals* records: \"Li Sheng, a native of Jiangxia, studied the arts of refining qi and nurturing form under a Daoist of Shaoshi. Yuan Zhen and Bai Juyi befriended him. In the gengzi year of Emperor Xizong’s reign, when Huang Chao invaded the capital, Li moved to Wanling.\"",

As *Zhuangzi* says: \"His sleep is unhurried, his waking at ease.\"\n\nConfucius also said: \"Eating coarse food, drinking water, pillowing my arm—happiness lies therein.\" This happiness arises when, in sleep, spirit and breath embrace, the spirit merges in darkness, the hundred vessels pulse in harmony, and bliss flows through the four limbs.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Yellow at the center, penetrating the pattern, rightly positioned in the body—beauty resides within.\"\n\nLong ago, the Yellow Emperor wandered in spirit to the land of Hua Xu. \"Clouds and mist did not obstruct his sight, thunder did not confuse his hearing, beauty and ugliness did not disturb his heart, mountains and valleys did not trip his steps.\" \"Awakening, he was joyful and content.\" This is proof of the Yellow Emperor’s benefit from reclining dhyana.\n\nOf the four dignified postures—walking, standing, sitting, lying—sleep is the most comfortable. When work wearies and energy flags, to stretch out on a couch, drift into sleep, and awaken refreshed—spirit at ease, qi flowing, the whole body at peace—is to reap the profound benefits of quiet nurturance in sleep.\n\nA human life spans a hundred years, active by day, resting by night, wholly dependent on sleep to regulate life and restore spirit. How much more so for those who practice the profound arts! For them, heart and breath intermingle in sleep, and even in sleep, heart and breath remain united.\n\nOrdinary people, in deep sleep at night, at the stillest moment, can only summon the true yin of heaven and earth, not the true yang. But if heart and breath unite in sleep, both can be summoned simultaneously. With the harmony of my heart and breath, I summon the harmony of heaven and earth—this is the moment when heaven and humanity unite. The benefits are boundless!\n\nWhen first practicing the union of heart and breath, if you can neither forget nor force it, but maintain it gently and continuously, even for a brief moment, you will fall asleep. Awakening, the hundred vessels are regulated, qi and blood harmonized, the spirit at ease—its wonder defies description.\n\nWith further progress, sleep naturally shifts into samadhi. Sleep is the harbinger of samadhi; samadhi arises from sleep. Beginners have sleep without samadhi; with long practice, they attain samadhi without sleep.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, for beginners in cultivation, the ability to fall asleep is itself a sign of efficacy, and the ability to fall asleep naturally and swiftly is even more wondrous. This state of sleep-samadhi is called \"simulated samadhi,\" entirely distinct from the dull slumber of ordinary people. Chan practitioners fear sleep during meditation, while Daoist adepts in heart-breath union fear its absence—how marvelous! This sleep-samadhi is the common path for beginners, the precursor to the great samadhi of true emptiness.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, the venerable Chen Tuan of Mount Hua would often sleep for months without rising, and ultimately attained the Dao in sleep. His sleep method, known as the \"Hibernating Dragon Technique,\" consists of thirty-two characters and is none other than the practice of heart-breath union, cultivated specifically in sleep. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* describes ten kinds of sleep, among which are \"meditative sleep\" and \"samadhi sleep.\" The *Departure from the Worldly* chapter states:\n\n\"A bodhisattva-mahāsattva has ten kinds of sleep. What are the ten? They are:\n1. **Tranquil sleep**, for body and mind are serene;\n2. **Meditative sleep**, for one cultivates and regulates practice;\n3. **Samadhi sleep**, for body and mind are supple;\n4. **Brahmā sleep**, for one does not disturb self or others;\n5. **Virtuous karma sleep**, for one has no regrets afterward;\n6. **Right faith sleep**, for it cannot be shaken;\n7. **Right path sleep**, for good friends awaken one;\n8. **Vow-perfecting sleep**, for one skillfully dedicates merit;\n9. **All tasks completed sleep**, for all deeds are accomplished;\n10. **Abandoning all effort sleep**, for all habits are relinquished.\nThese are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the great Dharma-sleep of the Tathāgata, fully capable of awakening all beings.\"\n\nHere, \"meditative sleep\" refers to the state where body and mind remain unmoving, as if in samadhi. \"Samadhi sleep,\" however, is when the true yang of heaven and earth enters one’s body, like sweet dew filling the sky or ghee pouring upon the crown—throughout the body, one feels soft, blissful, harmonious as spring, and intoxicated with joy. The sūtra’s phrase \"body and mind are supple\" refers precisely to this state. Confucius’s \"leaning on his arm as a pillow, delighting in the midst of it\" is likewise the realm of \"samadhi sleep.\"\n\nThe *Accounts of Immortals and Forgotten Traditions* records: When Xiahou [gap in text] crossed mountains and rivers, he would often close his eyes in blissful sleep. Though his companions heard his snoring, his steps never faltered, earning him the name \"Sleeping Immortal.\" This was likely one who practiced sleep-samadhi alongside the venerable Chen Tuan. As Confucius said, \"Virtue is never solitary; it always has neighbors\"—was this not so?\n\nThe Confucian immortal Shao Yong, in his *Verses from the Forest Retreat*, wrote:\n*\"In old age, the body remains naturally warm and gentle,\nIn the Nest of Peace, spring is ever-present.\nWith all affairs dismissed from the heart, one reclines at ease,\nThe four limbs stretch and relax as they please.\"*\n\nElsewhere, he wrote:\n*\"At night, I enter the Nest of Peace,\nAt dawn, I drink the Great Harmony.\nProfoundly realizing the Dao, one abides in tranquility,\nIn pure cultivation, one receives the bounty of heaven.\"*\n\nThus, Master Shao deeply grasped sleep-samadhi.\n\nThe immortal Master Bai Yuchan wrote:\n*\"Since stepping through the gate of Nirvāṇa,\nA pillow of pure wind for ten thousand years.\"*\n\nThis was Master Bai’s accomplishment, attaining the wondrous state of \"all tasks completed sleep.\" The gate of Nirvāṇa’s stillness is precisely the \"supreme Dharma-sleep of the Tathāgata.\" At this stage, one enters the great rest, abandoning all effort.\n\nWhen Chan Master Linji was sleeping in the monks’ hall, Huangbo entered and struck the board with his staff. Linji lifted his head, saw it was Huangbo, and went back to sleep. Huangbo struck the board again, then went to the upper hall and saw the head monk sitting in meditation. He said, \"The junior below is sitting in meditation, yet you are indulging in idle thoughts here!\" The head monk replied, \"What is this old fellow doing?\" Huangbo struck the board once more and left the hall.\n\nWhen Xuefeng and Yantou were stranded by snow at Mount Ao in Fengzhou, Yantou spent his days sleeping, while Xuefeng sat in meditation. One day, Xuefeng called out, \"Elder brother, elder brother, get up!\" Yantou said, \"What for?\" Xuefeng replied, \"We’ve traveled together with that fellow Wensui, and everywhere we’ve gone, we’ve been burdened by him. Now that we’re here, why do you just keep sleeping?\" Yantou shouted, \"Go back to sleep! Sitting on your bed all day is like being in some backwater village—one day, you’ll end up bewitching the men and women of some household!\" Xuefeng patted his chest and said, \"I’m not at ease here; I dare not deceive myself.\" Yantou said, \"I thought one day you’d build a grass hut on a solitary peak and propagate the great teaching, yet here you are still speaking like this.\" Xuefeng replied, \"I truly am not at ease.\" Yantou said, \"If that’s so, then according to your understanding, speak it all out. Where it’s correct, I’ll affirm it for you; where it’s not, I’ll strike it down.\"\n\nXuefeng said, \"When I first arrived at Yanguang, I heard the abbot expound on the principle of form and emptiness and gained an entry point.\" Yantou said, \"For the next thirty years, be sure never to bring this up again.\" Later, he saw Dongshan’s *Verse on Crossing the Water*:\n*\"Beware of seeking it from others,\nFor it grows ever distant from me.\nIt is now precisely me,\nYet I am no longer it.\"*\n\nYantou said, \"If that’s the case, you haven’t even saved yourself yet.\" He continued, \"Later, I asked Deshan, ‘In the ancestral teachings from above, does a student like me have a share or not?’ Deshan struck me with his staff and said, ‘Say something!’ At the time, I was like a bucket whose bottom had fallen out.\" Yantou shouted, \"You didn’t even ask! Those who enter through the gate are not the family jewels.\"",

With spirit entering the qi cavity, sitting or lying both contain the sleep practice—why must one recline on a stone pillow?\n\nThese thirty-two characters may well bring one to sudden great awakening. Lü Dongbin brought them to light out of compassion, which is also the heart of correcting errors.\n\n**Zhang Quanyi’s Postscript, written while residing on Mount Zhongnan**\n\n**Appendix: Letter from Master Wang to Meng Yangwu of Tianjin**\nI now transcribe and present Chen Xiyi’s sleep method, transmitted by the two ancestral masters Lü and Zhang. You may ponder it carefully. In sum, it does not exceed the four characters: *\"heart and breath mutually dependent.\"*\n\nThe elixir path has four methods—walking, standing, sitting, and lying—but the sleep method is the simplest and easiest. How do we know it is simple and easy? The greatest fear in learning the Dao is attachment to the physical body. If one clings to the physical body, it is merely a turbid thing of the posterior heaven, not the true yin and true yang of the prior heaven.\n\nWhen sleeping, body and mind must both be still. The method says: *\"The body unmoving, the heart naturally at peace; the heart unmoving, the spirit naturally guarded.\"* In a brief moment, practice *\"heart and breath mutually dependent.\"* Upon falling asleep, one naturally enters the state of no-self, no-other, forgetting things and form. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Wandering in the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\"*\n\nYou must understand that as long as heart and breath are mutually dependent when falling asleep, upon deep sleep, heart and breath will naturally remain so. Do not deliberately arrange it—what was called in the previous letter *\"following nature, not passively accepting it.\"* If you deliberately arrange it, you depart from the principle of *\"following nature.\"*\n\nAt any time, if there is leisure, proceed with the practice. If the physical body shows the slightest arousal of yang, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. If the physical body feels the slightest softness, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. If the physical body shows the slightest movement of qi or numbness, immediately turn to *\"heart and breath mutually dependent\"* outside the body. You must know the physical body is a thief—those who learn the Dao must never mistake the thief for their child.\n\nYou must practice until breath ceases, utterly tranquil and settled, not under your own control. As Master Ziyang said: *\"Though it acts as host, I am but a guest.\"* If you can abide in this for two hours, you are not far from the state of youthful purity.",
      "overlap_context": "For it grows ever distant from me.\nIt is now precisely me,\nYet I am no longer it.\"*\n\nYantou said, \"If that’s the case, you haven’t even saved yourself yet.\" He continued, \"Later, I asked Deshan, ‘In the ancestral teachings from above, does a student like me have a share or not?’ Deshan struck me with his staff and said, ‘Say something!’ At the time, I was like a bucket whose bottom had fallen out.\" Yantou shouted, \"You didn’t even ask!

      "translated_text": "When practicing the sleep technique, ensure to eat lightly and frequently.\n\nWang Hu, seventh day of the third month in the fifth year, aged seventy-three.\n\nThe profound mystery of intoxication: For Daoist cultivators of the Mysterious School, when practice reaches the state of *huanghu yaoming* (vague obscurity), external breath becomes faint—seeming both present and absent—at this moment, primordial true yang penetrates within, steaming the four limbs, irrigating above and below, suffusing with warm harmony, subtle and serene, resembling a gentle intoxication. As *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *\"Primordial qi, postnatal breath—those who attain it are ever as if drunk.\"* The preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says: *\"At first like clouds filling a thousand mountains, then like the moon embracing ten thousand waters; the spine like a turning wheel, the four limbs like mountain stone; the pores like one just risen from a bath, the bones and channels like one deep in slumber; the spirit like lovers in joyful union, the hun and po like mother and child in tender embrace.\"* These are the signs of primordial harmony between yin and yang, the true mechanism of gathering and refinement. To often enter this intoxicated realm, this state of *xiyi* (profound tranquility), is to constantly summon celestial harmony, where spirit and qi intermingle—thus the effects of nurturing the immortal embryo and refining the foundation become manifest. This \"intoxication\" is the hallmark of the Mysterious School. Ancient immortals who sang of it are too numerous to count, such as Jingyang’s *Drunken Longing for Immortality*, Sanfeng’s *Song of Primordial Qi*, and Ziyang’s *Song of Stone Bridge*.\n\nIn Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious*, the word \"intoxication\" appears frequently, as in:\n*\"Draw forth the cinnabar from Kan’s center, a golden flower reveals its branch.\nAuspicious clouds unfold across the heavens, propitious light fills the realm of death.\nReturning, one is dim and silent, like one drunk, like one entranced.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Wait for that single point to submit of its own accord, within the body it transforms into the four seasons’ spring.\nA wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance—each rain’s passing brings renewal.\nAll day languid as a drunkard, idly guarding the cavern’s eternal spring.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk, ah drunk, again drunk—within the cinnabar field, spring suffuses red as jade.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Riding the dragon, sword in hand, drunk I return home, revolving the three passes to pay homage at the northern gate.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Hungry, I drink the wine of immortality, each day merrily drunk as mud.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"If you ask where the return path lies, in drunkenness I point afar to the edge of white clouds.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Gathering the nectar from the eastern position, it becomes sweet dew; drinking the wine of the western realm, one is drunk amid brocade.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The Yellow Dame urges me to drink the wine of supreme bliss, each day steaming drunk in revelry.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wine of mysterious clarity—drunk as one entranced, all yin exhausted, the radiant yang season arrives.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"In movement and stillness, adding mercury and drawing forth lead, like one entranced, like one drunk, the spirit never wearies.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The intent from the west—like one drunk, like one entranced.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The wine of longevity needs no cup, sweet as honey, naturally sipping the medicinal measure, merrily off to the Peach Assembly.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"With a single sweep of light, behold the sovereign—before flowers and beneath the moon, merrily drunk.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I pass beyond the village at slanting sunlight—who knows I am the drunken dancer?\"*\nAnd:\n*\"In the western lands and southern realms, friends come to pay respects, as in days past, drunk and dazed.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk and dazed, forgetting heaven and earth—all fame and profit of past and present are but dust.\"*\n\nTruly, he had deeply grasped the threefold taste of the Mysterious School’s drunken immortality!\n\nAncestor Jingyang said:\n*\"Drunk longing for immortality, drunk longing for immortality—idle, I visit the grotto heavens.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Suddenly warming, I drift drunk to the immortal isles; the grotto gate slightly ajar, a young attendant watches.\"*\n\nAncestor Lü said:\n*\"Cultivate, cultivate until you reach the firm and dry—only then are you a drunken immortal in the human realm.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The jade zither and precious lute play for you; jade nectar and fine wine urge you to drink.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Unaware, I become drunk as if in a trance—within the trance, something appears.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"I say when drunk, truly drunk; I know not how sorrow arises.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Once the true scripture is attained, like one drunk—breath and a hundred pulses all return to the root.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"When the medicine is obtained, do not be reckless—like one entranced, like one drunk, speak less.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Drunk on green wine, sleeping through sun and moon; when the white duckweed wind stills, I fish by rivers and lakes.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"All day with no one to speak of tidings, a pot of spring wine to drink merrily.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Bored, I sleep drunk at the mountain path’s mouth; idle, I wander and fish in Dongting’s heart.\"*\n\nMaster Haichan said:\n*\"Drunk, I wander the land of white clouds, the copper-tailed handle upturned.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Liu the Fool arrives at the Dragon Flower Assembly, drunk by the limpid pool, the moon lingering late.\"*\n\nTan Chuduan said:\n*\"Since the clouds gathered within the tripod, I have constantly drunk the wine of supreme bliss, lying drunk in that realm.\"*\n\nTang Guangzhen said:\n*\"Only when the elixir is formed through union—drunk within the gourd, no need for support.\"*\n\nMa Danyang said:\n*\"All day I raise the cup to delight in the spirit’s grace; drunk, yet someone supports me.\"*\n\nZhang Ziyang’s *Song of Stone Bridge* says:\n*\"The scene is most beautiful, I rejoice in secret, pouring my own wine, merrily drunk.\nI pluck a stringless zither, its notes teaching me to listen carefully.\nAlas, after drunkenness, none know—dim and silent, just like one entranced.\"*\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*\"Drunk, I sleep soundly in deep slumber—my boat laden with treasures crosses Cao Creek.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said:\n*\"To make Zhang Gong drunk, you must use Li Gong’s wine.\nWait until his winter solstice arrives—a single cup of supreme bliss then enters his mouth.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Those who came together to lean on the railing—drunk in the spring wind, awaiting the moon’s return.\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"As long as the host can make me drunk,\nWhy should I stir up homesickness again?\"\n\nSu’an Ding Chan Master said:\n*\"Cold mist and setting sun fill the forest’s edge,\nWine cups pass frequently, spirits soar high.\nIf the fine guest can still be blown to drunkenness,\nThe host, once sober, brews pure wine anew.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous drunkenness of the Chan school.\n\nSong Confucian Shao Yaofu’s *Jirao Collection* states:\n*\"In the Peaceful Joy Nest, a single cup of wine—\nNot only nurtures qi but also preserves the true.\nSipped again and again until mildly drunk,\nWith every pat, the heart brims with spring.\nNo different from the first meeting of lord and minister,\nOr heaven and earth’s sudden intertwining of yin and yang.\nThe intoxicating savor defies description,\nThe alchemy’s workings elude all pointing.\"*\n\nHe also said:\n*\"A thousand sages’ mysteries lie in chaos,\nDrunk, one embraces spring’s myriad blossoms.\"*\n\nMing Confucian Chen Baisha wrote:\n*\"Alone, I hasten to the stream’s edge, dancing in my fishing cloak,\nMoon bright, drunk shadows sway together.\nIn hand, I grasp the Tong River’s line—\nTo pierce the river-sky, no need for many casts.\"*\n\nHe also wrote:\n*\"West Woods gathers rain, the turtledove’s spirit lingers,\nI roll up the quilt, open the window to dawn’s clarity.\nWind and sun intoxicate the flowers, flowers intoxicate the birds,\nPast the bamboo gate, two or three calls echo.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"A thousand peaks fall silent, keeping you drunk,\nBegging the world to turn into a painted boat.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous drunkenness of the Confucian school.\n\nGenerally, drunkenness has pre-heaven and post-heaven distinctions. Post-heaven drunkenness arises from excessive drinking, where the spirit and essence are overwhelmed by intoxication. Pre-heaven drunkenness, however, is the harmonious union of the body’s yin and yang, externally infused with the primordial qi of original harmony, steaming and melting, the spirit in perfect equilibrium—entering a state of vagueness and profound obscurity akin to drunkenness. My late master, instructing his inner disciples, often cited this phrase as the path of cultivation. For one who can constantly abide in this \"drunk-like\" state dwells purely in the pre-heavenly, avoids the illnesses of the physical body, and all dharmic proofs arise unbidden. This phrase, \"constantly as if drunk,\" is the esoteric essence of the Daoist school’s drunken immortality samadhi, and serves as verification of the *Great Change*’s \"yellow center penetrates principle\" and \"preserving the great harmony\"—what is called \"beauty within, flowing through the four limbs,\" precisely the scenery of drunkenness.\n\nMing Confucian Chen Baisha said: *\"Sobering is easier than getting drunk; only those deeply versed in the *Yi* can achieve true drunkenness.\"* Herein lies the secret profundity of sagely learning!\n\n**Appendix:**\nCangmingzi’s poem on the *Ruyao Jing*’s \"Those who attain it are constantly as if drunk,\" with commentary.\n\nThe poem reads:\n*The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is supremely subtle,\nScholars abound, but who truly comprehends?\nOnce attained, know it as eternal attainment—\nBest to lay the foundation with swift action.\nIn the dim and silent vastness of the void,\nThere is being, there is non-being—mystery without end.\nWithin the square-inch pot, it never runs dry,\nFor the self knows no day without spring’s wind.*\n\nThe commentary states: This describes the scenery after obtaining the medicine. Once the golden liquid returning elixir is swallowed and enters the belly, it transforms the mortal frame into a true person, giving rise to natural phenomena. The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Trickling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice, from head to foot it streams, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through boundless depths, it fills the body with gentle warmth. The complexion becomes increasingly moist, the bones and joints grow ever stronger.\"* All this is \"beauty within, shining on the face, flourishing on the back, flowing through the four limbs, reaching the entire body\"—self-evident, these are all natural effects.\n\n**Appendix:**\nExcerpt from Master Wang’s letter to Mr. Meng of Tianjin:\n\nThe terms \"gathering\" and \"harvesting\" cannot be separated. If gathering and harvesting cannot be distinguished, how can the pre-heavenly essence, qi, and spirit be separated? If one says: *\"In the state of profound obscurity, one gathers pre-heavenly essence; in the state of vagueness, one gathers pre-heavenly primordial qi; in the state of primal chaos, one gathers pre-heavenly primordial spirit\"*—this is merely speaking of principle. To know that profound obscurity, vagueness, and primal chaos cannot be separated is to know that primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit also cannot be separated.\n\nSome say: *\"Gather in profound obscurity, welcome in vagueness.\"* Others say: *\"Use it unseen, meet in vagueness.\"* And again: *\"Gather in vagueness, harvest in obscurity, within profound obscurity collect the true thing.\"* In sum, these are the true writings of various masters, each taking their own imagery. Only the *Ruyao Jing* states it most directly and wondrously: *\"Pre-heavenly qi, post-heavenly qi—those who attain it are constantly as if drunk.\"* The three words \"constantly as if drunk\" are truly crucial.\n\nPushing further: the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, every stage’s scenery, every stage’s effects, every stage’s firing times—all are \"constantly as if drunk.\" If even a thread or hair clings to the physical body, it is no longer \"constantly as if drunk.\" If it is not \"constantly as if drunk,\" it is not the Way. To know \"constantly as if drunk\" is to know how a foolish, ignorant person ascends to the realm of the sages.\n\nFurthermore, I have four or five commentaries on the *Yu Huang Xin Yin Jing*, but Lu Qianxu’s *Xin Yin Ce Shu* is the finest. I have specially mailed you a copy—be sure to read and contemplate it deeply, and perhaps you will grasp the wonder of \"constantly as if drunk.\"\n\n**74. Stability is Most Supreme**\nIn the work of the Daoist school, one first enters vagueness and profound obscurity through sleep, then from vagueness and profound obscurity attains great stability. External breathing ceases—initially like a lone leaf of a skiff drifting in midstream, and with time, like the moon illuminating a cold pond, ten thousand miles of limpid blue. The duration gradually lengthens from short to long.",

      "translated_text": "The transformation of the spiritual embryo and the transmutation of the divine all unfold within the state of stability—this is the mysterious gateway to entering sageliness and the essential ford to transcending the mundane. Dongshan said: *\"Right within the off-center, at the first watch of the third night, the moon shines bright.\"* Tong’an said: *\"How does one sing the tune of returning home? Before the moonlit hall, blossoms on a withered tree.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"A single wheel of moonlight keeps me company.\"* And again: *\"A single wheel of bright moon illuminates the flourishing south.\"* Liu Wuyuan said: *\"A single wheel of bright moon shines at the heart of heaven.\"* Shao Yaofu said: *\"The moon of the parasol tree shines into my bosom.\"* And again: *\"The moon reaches the heart of heaven, the wind comes to the surface of the water.\"* All these describe the realm of stability. Whether in Chan, Daoism, or Confucianism, none fails to take stability as its归宿.\n\nZhuangzi speaks of *\"auspiciousness rests where it rests\"* and *\"abiding in great stability.\"* He also says: *\"The spirit that arises from instability is not borne by the Dao.\"* Profound and subtle indeed!\n\nStability has two distinct types: the first is stability with breathing, and the second is stability without breathing. The practice of the Daoist school pertains to the second kind—where body and mind are both stabilized, the breath of inhalation and exhalation ceases, and the eyelids remain unmoving. This is true quiescence. If the mind is stable but the breath does not cease, it is but a semblance of quiescence, not true stability.\n\nIn the *Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra*, *The Assembly of the Vastly Learned Sage*, the World-Honored One told the sage: *\"Great Sage, you should know that among my disciples, the foremost voice-hearer, Gavāṃpati, is a Brahmin of pure lineage. Abiding in the meditative stability of compassion, he opens the eye of kindness with such mastery that he enters samādhi. Only once every seven days does he manifest a single breath of inhalation and exhalation. When he enters samādhi, a wind responsive to his will arrives at his bidding. Even if the kalpa-fire were to burn heaven and earth into a single blaze, his meditative body would remain unharmed—not so much as a mustard seed’s worth—while his limbs, like Mount Meru, stand immovably firm. The dragon kings Nanda and Upananda, possessed of great power, stir the winds with fierce might, causing Mount Meru to tremble, roaring like thunder, and turning the waters of the four great seas salty. Yet when Gavāṃpati enters samādhi, those two dragon kings, exerting all their might, cannot disturb him in the slightest.\"*\n\nSince it is said that only once every seven days does he manifest a breath of inhalation and exhalation, it is clear that when he truly enters samādhi, he is free from breathing and can remain in stability for seven days. Even the mighty dragon kings cannot move him by a hair’s breadth, and even the raging kalpa-fire cannot harm a single strand of his being. Thus, the great quiescent stability without breath is most sublime, beyond the reach of thought or discussion.\n\nMoreover, in the *Sūtra of the Essential Collections of All Buddhas*, it is recorded that Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, having departed from the world of Endurance (this world), arrived at the realm of the Buddha Heavenly King of Universal Light. To the right of the Thus-Come One Heavenly King stood a woman named Detached Mind, seated in full lotus, abiding in the samādhi of the Moon of Universal Purity, Free from Defilement. Mañjuśrī asked the Heavenly King Buddha: *\"How long has this woman aspired to the supreme, correct, and true path of enlightenment? Her conduct is serene, her vows lofty, and her stability so profound—what is the duration of her resolve?\"* The Buddha replied: *\"Since she first aroused the aspiration for the supreme, correct, and true path, it cannot be reckoned. Diligent and faithful, she is ever free from negligence, practicing generosity, precepts, patience, vigor, single-minded concentration, and wisdom, perfecting the Buddha Way. Her deeds are complete. Mañjuśrī, bid this woman arise from samādhi, and you may ask her how long she has upheld the path. You will see her response.\"*\n\nThereupon, Mañjuśrī, hearing the Buddha’s instruction, rose from his seat and approached the woman. With utmost sincerity, he snapped his fingers and called out in a great voice, seeking to rouse her. Yet she remained still, unmoving in samādhi. Mañjuśrī then transformed his form into countless manifestations, snapping his fingers ever higher, so that the sound of his snapping reached innumerable worlds in the ten directions—yet the woman remained unmoved, not arising from samādhi.\n\nThen Mañjuśrī entered the samādhi of the Form-Likeness Concentration and manifested great spiritual powers. All beings in the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds—humans, devas, dragons, gandharvas, and others—countless in number, found their instruments of music sounding of their own accord, while he conjured lutes, zithers, harps, flutes, and myriad other instruments, all playing in unison, producing soft, clear, harmonious, and elegant sounds, mournful and sorrowful, each emitting countless tones that resounded through the ten directions and immeasurable worlds—yet they could not rouse the woman from samādhi.\n\nMañjuśrī again entered the samādhi of the Form-Likeness Concentration and transformed the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds: Mount Sumeru, the Snow Mountains, the Black Mountains, Mount Mucilinda, the Great Mount Mucilinda, the Iron Enclosure Mountains, and the Great Iron Enclosure Mountains—all collided and clashed, unable to remain still. Like a mighty warrior clapping his palms with great force, or like a great thunderclap, the sound spread far and wide, heard by all. As the mountains—Sumeru, the Iron Enclosures, and others—collided and trembled, each crumbled and fell, their forms terrifying, their sounds piteous. Yet the great noise reached immeasurable, boundless worlds, and still, the woman’s samādhi did not waver.\n\nThen Mañjuśrī, without approaching her, employed his skillful means: with both hands, he seized the woman, seeking to raise her into a seated posture. Yet he shook the buddha-lands of the Ganges’ sands below, and still, he could not move her so much as a hair’s breadth, nor could he cause her to arise from samādhi.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, Mañjuśrī summoned all his power, seeking to lift the woman. Yet even as he uprooted and overturned buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, he could not rouse her from samādhi. Mañjuśrī then severed the ground beneath where she sat, lifting her upon his right palm and casting her beyond buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges to the east. To the south, west, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below—each direction received buddha-lands as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in the same manner. Across the buddha-lands of the ten directions, all musical instruments and melodies resounded, mountains crumbled and fell with terrifying sounds, heavenly flowers rained down, and their harmonious echoes spread unimaginably—yet still, he could not rouse the woman from samādhi.\n\nThereupon, Mañjuśrī tossed the woman throughout the ten directions, yet failed to awaken her, and so returned her to her original place. With hands clasped, he addressed Tathāgata Heavenly King: “O Great Sage, the practices of all bodhisattvas are most extraordinary, beyond reach or measure. In contemplation, I weigh thus: I can transform the vessels of empty space, make them stand, revolve, walk, come, converse—yet now, I manifest boundless divine concentration, transformative movements, and stirring great sounds; I shatter Sumeru and the Iron Enclosure Mountains, uproot buddha-lands, and shift the worlds of the ten directions—yet still, I cannot cause her to arise from samādhi. I shall humble myself and bow to this woman. Moreover, all other learned bodhisattvas, all sons and daughters of noble families who first arouse the unsurpassed, true, and correct aspiration for the Way—whether already accomplished, yet to be accomplished, or just beginning their studies—if they aspire to such boundless great wisdom, they too should pay homage to her. Why is this so? The practices of bodhisattvas cannot be repaid or compared.”\n\nTathāgata Heavenly King replied to Mañjuśrī: “Truly, as you say, the armor of virtue worn by bodhisattvas and great beings is inconceivable. All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot comprehend it—how much less can ordinary beings attain it! It is like taking a great drumstick the size of a thousand-world universe and striking a drum before this woman for a full kalpa, or even beyond a kalpa—yet she would not hear its sound, much less arise from samādhi. Mañjuśrī, should this woman’s samādhi remain still and tranquil, never wavering, her wisdom of the Way would be thus, her virtue and power without limit.”\n\nNow, when the woman Li Yi entered this samādhi of true concentration, she must have severed both inhalation and exhalation; otherwise, had the great bodhisattva Mañjuśrī merely used his spiritual power to cut off her breath, this woman would not have remained in samādhi. Yet even as Mañjuśrī shook, overturned, and hurled her across the ten directions, she was not disturbed; even when he carried her to the realm of Brahmā, she remained unaware. His divine power could not so much as ruffle a single hair of hers—her stillness and concentration remained unchanged. Could one who has not stilled both thought and breath, returning to the state of nothingness, achieve such a state?\n\nFurthermore, if breath ceases but the pulse does not, Mañjuśrī could have used his spiritual power to restrain her moving pulse, and the woman would not have been able to re-enter samādhi. Only when breath ceases, pulse ceases, and body and mind are extinguished like empty space can one remain unmoved by external forces. The great stillness of the profound school precisely embodies this image.\n\nI observe that the concentration of the woman Li Yi is truly perfect, like a living corpse—thus, even Mañjuśrī could not disturb her. Her ability to draw near to Tathāgata Heavenly King is precisely because her body and mind are as still and clear as empty space. This koan contains two layers of meaning.\n\nIn its simpler interpretation, when body and mind are extinguished and one enters deep samādhi, it is like empty space—no external force can disturb it, no thought or movement of the mind can arise to break the concentration. This demonstrates the excellence of meditative concentration.\n\nIn its deeper, esoteric interpretation, Mañjuśrī represents wisdom, while Li Yi represents concentration. Concentration and wisdom are one—thus, wisdom cannot rouse her from concentration, for Mañjuśrī’s spiritual power is not inferior to hers. The great fool Zhi once said, “A monk lodging in a temple”—this phrase is most profound, for it reveals the wondrous unity of concentration and wisdom.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Entry into the Realm of Reality” chapter, the youth Sudhana visits the bhikṣu Ocean Banner. He sees him seated in the full lotus posture, entering samādhi, with inhalation and exhalation ceased, no separate thoughts or awareness, both thought and breath forgotten—this is the same realm as entering true concentration in the profound school. Ocean Banner remained in samādhi for six months and six days, during which, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, countless buddha-bodies, bodhisattva-bodies, pratyekabuddha and śrāvaka-bodies, Indra-bodies, Brahmā-bodies, elder and householder-bodies, kṣatriya and brāhmaṇa-bodies, sage-bodies, dragon-king bodies, asura-king bodies, yakṣa and rākṣasa-bodies, kiṁnara-king bodies, and gandharva-king bodies manifested, pervading the ten directions and the entire dharma-realm. The excellence and uniqueness of this realm left Sudhana in ceaseless admiration. This profound samādhi is called *Universal Eye Attainment*, also known as the *Gate of Universal Adornment and Purity*, and is most vast.\n\nThe meditative concentration of the profound school, beginning with a few minutes and extending to several hours or even a full day and night, can, with further advancement, last for six months in a single sitting—thus, it is not difficult to follow in the footsteps of Ocean Banner and rival the sages of old. The *Ten Concentrations* chapter of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* records that the Tathāgata, in the Hall of Universal Light, entered the *Samādhi of All Buddhas in a Single Instant*, abiding in *śamatha*, most tranquil, possessing great virtue and power, unstained by anything, enabling all who saw him to attain awakening. Furthermore, in the *Introduction* chapter of the *Lotus Sūtra*, after expounding the *Sūtra of Infinite Meanings*, the Buddha sat in the full lotus posture and entered the *Samādhi of the Realm of Infinite Meanings*, his body and mind unmoving. At that time, heavenly mandārava and mañjūṣaka flowers rained down upon all the buddha-worlds, and the earth trembled in six ways—this was the Buddha’s manner of entering samādhi.",

Yet the great noise reached immeasurable, boundless worlds, and still, the woman’s samādhi did not waver.\n\nThen Mañjuśrī, without approaching her, employed his skillful means: with both hands, he seized the woman, seeking to raise her into a seated posture. Yet he shook the buddha-lands of the Ganges’ sands below, and still, he could not move her so much as a hair’s breadth, nor could he cause her to arise from samādhi.",

      "translated_text": "The *Qingliang Mountain Record* states: \"The Ming monk Mingshan initially built a thatched hut in the southern valley of Zhongtai. After many days of receiving alms, someone envious of his prosperity sent an assassin to lodge there for the night. In the dead of night, the assassin peered in and saw Mingshan sitting upright and motionless, his eyes like autumn waters, his breath nearly imperceptible. The assassin knelt in reverence and confessed his sin.\"\n\nNow, his posture of sitting upright and unmoving was precisely the state of entering samādhi; his breath nearly imperceptible did not mean it had ceased, but rather that it had become exceedingly subtle. This was samādhi with breath still present, yet it had already moved the assassin’s heart—such was the marvelous efficacy of samādhi!\n\nThe *Ṣaḍpāramitā Sūtra* states: \"The Buddha’s path is distant and unattainable by ordinary beings. There is but one method that benefits sentient beings: right samādhi. If bodhisattvas have not attained this samādhi, their minds cannot remain pure and unmoving. Birth-and-death and nirvāṇa are without duality. For this reason, to liberate sentient beings, they skillfully employ expedient means, diligently cultivating the corresponding *dhyāna*—the unconditioned wisdom of stillness—like empty space, pure and unstained, eternally unchanging. They further contemplate this samādhi as resembling the full moon, while all delusive thoughts are like floating clouds. Moreover, this right samādhi is like a cool, refreshing breeze, dispelling all clouds and obscurations, radiant and luminous, bringing joy to all sentient beings who behold it. Just as the full moon’s brilliance adorns the world, granting sentient beings coolness and bliss, so too does this stillness of *dhyāna*—the cool breeze—dispel the clouds of delusive thoughts rooted in emptiness. The full moon of right samādhi appears in the world, its great compassionate light extinguishing the fires of afflictions in sentient beings, leading them to the purity and bliss of nirvāṇa.\"\n\nAt that time, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:\n*\"Stillness gives rise to wisdom,\nWisdom accords with principle.\nThe great bodhi of buddhahood\nHas samādhi and prajñā as its roots.\"*\n\nIt further states: \"Those who attain profound spiritual samādhi without dullness thereby awaken the five supernormal powers through this stillness. What are the five? The divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of others’ minds, recollection of past lives, and the power of miraculous transformation.\"\n\nIt also says: \"When bodhisattvas abide in the *Immovable Ground*, they attain true stillness, eliminating sorrow, suffering, joy, and the arising of thoughts, as well as the inhalation and exhalation of breath. Unborn and undying, they dwell in the true Dharma-realm (thus we know that the true samādhi of the Buddha-clan also severs the breath, and only then is it called true stillness). They manifest various miraculous transformations, freely altering their form at will, and none can disturb them—save the Tathāgata, none can destroy them.\"\n\nThe *Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra*, in the *\"Bodhisattva Treasury\" Assembly’s \"Dhyāna Pāramitā\"* chapter, states: \"The samādhi attained by bodhisattvas is supremely profound and wondrous. The bodhisattva abides in it at once, equally gathering and guiding—this state is called *samāhita*. Furthermore, Śāriputra, the samādhi obtained by the bodhisattva through the perfection of stillness is subtle, deep, and sublime, accessible only to wisdom, and is also named *samāpatti*. Śāriputra, such wondrous samādhi is equal to the nature of all dharmas.\"\n\nIt further says: \"Abiding and well-abiding, they attain immovability. In all postures, their minds remain in samādhi, yet they do not discriminate the postures they assume. Their minds are thoroughly refined, delighting in profound samādhi. Unagitated and unexalted, without fluctuation, far removed from dullness, they skillfully recognize all occasions and adapt to the world without mingling with its nature. They transcend the eight worldly concerns—gain and loss, and so forth—untainted by afflictions and delusions. Distant from clamor, far from their usual conduct, they ever rest in equanimity, in the equality of the Dharma-nature, yet without forsaking profound samādhi while engaging in all worldly activities. Śāriputra, it is through the perfection of stillness that bodhisattvas attain such boundless virtues.\"\n\nIt also proclaims:\n*\"Stillness, liberation, and the far shore,\nCultivated through eons of diligent practice.\nTheir minds pure, unstained by defilement,\nUnsullied by worldly dharmas, like the lotus flower.\nGreat samādhi, each pervading illumination,\nThis samādhi, through cultivation, reaches the far shore...\n(omitted passage)\nOr each samādhi as vast, all-pervading illumination,\nThe realm of all buddhas and tathāgatas.\nAttaining such still and tranquil samādhi,\nAnd countless other boundless virtues.\nCultivating stillness to reach the far shore,\nThe bodhisattva’s merits are vast and immeasurable.\nIn motion and stillness, they ever dwell in the realm of stillness,\nTheir minds undisturbed, ever serene.\nWhether walking, lying down, or at rest, they abide in samādhi,\nNo posture exists where they are not in samādhi.\nWithin samādhi, they emit great sounds,\nFor the nature of all dharmas is ever still.\nWithout differentiation, without",

      "translated_text": "\"Of old, Subhūti in tranquil sitting saw heavenly flowers drift in the void.\" During the Five Dynasties, Chan Master Yongming Shou of Mount Tiantai’s Tianzhu Peak practiced samādhi for ninety days, whereupon Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva anointed him with sweet dew, and he attained unobstructed eloquence. In the Sui dynasty, Great Master Zhizhe cultivated the *Lotus Sutra* samādhi; in stillness, he entered samādhi and beheld the assembly at Vulture Peak, as if it had never dispersed. In the Tang, Great Master Sengqie entered samādhi on the wild plains of the Central Terrace of Mount Qingliang, where heavenly flowers gathered about his knees, and he arose only after seven days. The sublime manifestations of samādhi are beyond the ink of oceans to record; here, a mere one or two are cited to inspire faith.\n\nSeventy-Five\nThe Most Wondrous Forgetting\nAt the apex of samādhi, one enters the samādhi of no-mind, unattached to being or non-being—this is wondrous forgetting. Yanzi’s \"sitting in forgetfulness\" transcended form and relinquished knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare; Confucius, in emptiness, exhausted both extremes. This is the forgetting of the Confucian school.\n\nMaster Tan’s *Book of Transformations* states: \"Forget form to nurture qi; forget qi to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.\" Elder Yu Chan said: \"Forgetting form to nurture qi is the golden elixir; facing scenes without emotion is the great return. Forget form, transform qi; transform qi into spirit—thus the Great Dao penetrates the Three Passes.\" Cao Wenyu said: \"Merge into one and forget the one; then may you emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.\" He also said: \"This Dao is easy to know but hard to practice; only when one forgets what is practiced is the Dao complete.\" Sun Bu’er said: \"Qi flows through the Three Isles; spirit forgets and merges with the Great Void.\" She also said: \"Forget spirit, unattached to form; unite with the ultimate, leaving emptiness behind.\" Ancestor Lü said: \"The pine wind intoxicates me with twofold forgetting.\" He also said: \"Cease thoughts, forget scheming, and merge with the natural.\" And: \"In stillness seek the true—true stillness; from forgetting the mind, reach forgetting-forgetting.\" And: \"From this, the solitary spirit silently unites with the Great Void, pure and still, forgetting form.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"Facing scenes, forget emotion and play with moonlight.\" He also said: \"In the immortal’s chamber, qi and blood are utterly forgotten; the precious tripod and golden furnace need not be watched.\" Li Qing’an said: \"Suddenly forget self and others, and the Three Flowers gather.\" He also said: \"In worldly affairs, forget scheming and tasks anew.\" And: \"Harmonizing light and blending with the vulgar, forget self and others; only the self knows what precedes the Emperor of Images.\" Elder Ziyang said: \"Forget circumstances, exhaust emotions, and follow natural truth to realize the forbearance of the unborn dharma.\" The *Ancient Scripture of the Red Writ* states: \"Forget the eyes, and light overflows without limit; forget the ears, and the mind’s awareness abides in profound depths. When both mechanisms are forgotten, the gate to all wonders is cut off.\" The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states: \"When wisdom’s light arises, it becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting.\" This is the forgetting of the Mystery School.\n\nThe Chan Master Huangbo said: \"Forgetting both mind and realm is the true Dharma. Forgetting the realm is easy; forgetting the mind is most difficult.\" Great Master Sengcan said: \"In oneness, embody the mysterious, suddenly forgetting conditions.\" He also said: \"The infinitesimal merges with the vast—this is the realm of forgetting conditions.\" Great Master Zhenjue said: \"Thoughts do not cease without forgetting dust; dust does not cease without stilling thoughts. Forget dust and still thoughts, then forgetting occurs; still thoughts, and dust is forgotten and stilled. Forgetting dust and stilling, there is nothing to still. Stilling thoughts and forgetting, there is nothing to forget. Dust has nothing to oppose; when dust is relinquished, there is no opposition. Nothing to still, thoughts extinguished, not-knowing. The nature of not-knowing differs from wood and stone. This is the place of the initial mind—difficult to comprehend.\"\n\nChan Master Huangpan said: \"Simply still and forget the mind, merge with the Dharma Realm, and attain freedom.\" This is the forgetting of the Chan school. The Chan school must suddenly forget delusion and awakening to penetrate the final barrier, not abiding in initial awakening, obscurely merging with original awakening. The power of the word \"forget\" is most wondrous, its force the greatest. At the apex of cultivation and realization in the Three Teachings, all draw strength from the word \"forget.\" Only through forgetting can subject and object, nature and emptiness be cast off; only through forgetting can emotions cease and views vanish, utterly without inside or outside; only through forgetting can the power of samādhi grow and the embryo of the Dao be perfected.\n\nThe late Master once said: \"If scholars can make the word 'forget' their master, the effects will be like splitting bamboo. Though ten thousand study the Dao, ten thousand do not know—what is most precious is the single word 'forget.'\" Layman Yuanming said: \"In learning worldly matters, without utmost effort of the mind, learning cannot be accomplished; in awakening to the Dharma beyond the world, without utmost effort of no-mind, awakening cannot be thorough.\" How profound these words! The \"utmost effort of no-mind\" refers to the realm of absolute forgetting. Thus, the three times are perfectly interpenetrated, the ten thousand conditions are clarified and still, one enters the wondrous gate of all wonders, and accords with the Great Dao of true constancy.\n\nTrue Man Ziqing’s *Revealing the Secrets of the Mysterious Pass* states: \"Master Tan said: 'Forget form to nurture qi; forget qi to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness.' This single word 'forget' is nothingness. 'Originally, not a single thing—where can dust alight?' Does this not refer to this?\" If one can savor this principle and cultivate the effort of the single word \"forget,\" one can enter the profound subtleties of the Great Dao, seize the wondrous functioning of the natural, establish the foundation of the elixir in an instant, and move the transformations of creation within a single body. In his *Commentary on the Treasure Chapters of the Dao and Virtue*, the essentials are to forget things, forget self, forget mind, forget nature, forget form, forget spirit, and forget words—without deep attainment in the Dao, one cannot express this.\n\nCultivating the Dao is not difficult; what is difficult is thorough forgetting. The *Zhuangzi*, throughout, demonstrates the use of the word \"forget.\"\"",

      "translated_text": "As it is said: \"To nourish the will, forget the form; to nourish the form, forget profit; to attain the Dao, forget the mind.\" Again it says: \"Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\" And again: \"Forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. Those who forget the self are said to enter into Heaven.\" And again: \"Nothing is not nothing, nothing is not being—serene and boundless, all beauties follow from this.\" And again: \"When the spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praise Yao and blame Jie, better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\" And again: \"Who can ascend to Heaven and wander in the mists, stirring and turning without limit, forgetting life together, without end or exhaustion?\" And again: \"The fish-trap exists for the fish—once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit-snare exists for the rabbit—once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for meaning—once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?\" And again: \"Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, abandon all relations with things, and merge with the vast darkness.\" And again: \"One must fast to still the mind. After fasting for three days, one dares not entertain thoughts of reward, rank, or emolument; after five days, one dares not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, skill and clumsiness; after seven days, one suddenly forgets one’s four limbs and physical form.\" And again: \"Forget the feet, and shoes fit well; forget the waist, and the belt fits well. Without inner change or outer compliance, one attains perfect accord with events. From the beginning of accord, one never fails to be in accord—forgetting accord is the true accord.\" And again: \"Forget the liver and gall, disregard the ears and eyes, wander in vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam in the workings of non-action.\" And again: \"Forget years, forget righteousness, rouse oneself in the boundless—thus lodge in the boundless.\" And again: \"In such a state, the mind is forgotten.\" And again: \"Forgetting and returning,\" \"Returning to the source without nourishment, forgetting others—forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person.\" And again: \"It is not that I do not tell you—my mind desires to speak but forgets.\" And again: \"I have served you so thoroughly that I forget, and you have served me so thoroughly that you forget. Though you may worry, what is there to fear? Even if we forget our former selves, there is something I do not forget.\"\n\nZhuangzi may be said to excel in expounding the divine subtleties of the word \"forget.\" Within, forget the liver and gall; without, forget self and others—when nothing is not forgotten, nothing is not possessed. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow from this. If this is not the utmost wonder of the world, what could compare?\n\nIn the *Free and Easy Wandering*, it speaks of the \"perfected person without self\"—this is forgetting the self. In the *Equality of Things and Opinions*, it begins with Nan Guo Ziqi \"responding as if he had lost his counterpart,\" and again says: \"Now I have lost myself\"—this is forgetting the form. In *The Human World*, it reveals the wonder of Yan Hui’s \"fasting of the mind\": \"Before I, Hui, was sent, it was truly myself; once sent, there was no longer myself—can this be called emptiness?\" This is the forgetting of both body and mind. In *The Great and Venerable Teacher*, it speaks of \"putting the world outside, putting things outside, putting life outside\"—this is forgetting everything within and without. It also shows Yan Hui’s \"sitting in forgetfulness,\" merging with the great thoroughfare—this is the sudden realization of the wondrous identity of inner and outer, body and mind, after long forgetting of both. In *Letting Be and Exercising Forbearance*, it reveals \"great unity without self.\" In *Heaven and Earth*, it reveals \"Xiangwang obtaining the pearl\"—all these are the subtle and wondrous workings of the word \"forget.\" Thus, the *Zhuangzi* reaches its summit in the single word \"forget.\" Once one attains the state of forgetting both mind and circumstances, entering the One True Dharma Realm is not difficult.\n\nIn the cultivation of the Mysterious School, stillness is the foundation, and forgetting is the return. Yet if mind and breath are not forgotten, stillness cannot be attained. Thus, it may be said that the entire process of the elixir Way, from beginning to end, can be encompassed in the single word \"forget\"—there is nothing it does not include. When refining essence to transform qi, if one cannot forget the form, one will surely suffer the calamity of essence leakage. When refining qi to transform spirit, if one cannot forget qi, one will surely suffer the calamity of qi leakage. Master Yuchan’s *Poem on Failing to Refine the Elixir* says: \"In the middle of the night, sudden wind and thunder, mist and vapor fill the vast emptiness. Such feelings and flavors—even a mute would bite through his tongue.\" This may serve as a warning from past experience.\n\nWhen refining spirit to return to emptiness, if one cannot forget spirit, one cannot embody the Great Void and attain the wondrous realization of the Dharma Body pervading empty space. Thus, in the \"Transformation of the Dao\" chapter of Tanzi’s *Book of Transformation*, the three stages of cultivation—nourishing qi, nourishing spirit, and nourishing emptiness—are all subsumed under the single word \"forget.\" No one who has spoken profoundly of the Mysterious School through the ages has matched this in subtlety and wondrous simplicity.\n\nGenerally speaking, in both precelestial cultivation and postcelestial arts, if one does not reach the state of forgetting, transformation cannot occur. Thus, the *Zhuangzi* says: \"You are about to forget your spirit and qi—then you may approach it!\" Is this not the meaning of Cao Wenyi’s words: \"Merge into one (mind and breath interdependent), then forget the one (forget both mind and breath)—thus may one emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation\"?\n\nScholars of the Mysterious School know only the wonder of mind and breath merging as one, yet they do not know that forgetting both mind and breath is the wonder within wonder—for without forgetting, there can be no stillness. Profound and subtle indeed!\n\nRegarding the fire phases of the Mysterious School, if one were to summarize their essentials in a single word, they may be divided into four stages: first, harmony; next, intoxication; then, stillness; and finally, forgetting.",

      "translated_text": "Yet harmony is never without stillness, stillness is never without intoxication, and intoxication is never without forgetting. Observe the utterly drunk: when they fall from a carriage to the ground, they suffer no injury—precisely because, in drunkenness, both mind and breath are forgotten. If this is true even for the postnatal, how much more so for the prenatal! Thus, though four words are given, they may in truth interpenetrate and merge. Ah! The essentials of Daoist cultivation are here laid bare.\n\nMaster Yulin Xiu, a great Chan monk of the early Qing, composed a work titled *Questions from a Guest*, in which he exhaustively extolled the word *forgetting*. He declared: “One who cannot forget the body cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget the mind cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget the world cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget fame cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget profit cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget wife and children cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget household and career cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget knowledge and views cannot study the Dao; one who cannot forget learning and habit cannot study the Dao.” Only when body and mind, inner and outer, are all forgotten together—when all is relinquished at once, and the dusty world is wholly forgotten—does one daily draw nearer to the Dao.\n\nIn the Mysterious School’s initial practice of interdependent mind and breath, if one does not reach the stage of dual forgetting, one cannot even fall asleep—if sleep is unattainable, how much less stillness? Thus, *forgetting* is most wondrous, *forgetting* is most sublime!\n\n---\n\n**76. Leisure is Most Precious**\n\nWhat is leisure? It is the state of body and mind at ease, free from the disturbance of miscellaneous toil and vexation, and imbued with a sense of serene contentment. As the *Zhuangzi* says: “Can you be together without contrivance? Be bland and still? Be vast and clear? Be harmonious and at leisure?” This expresses the meaning.\n\nGenerally, the study of the Dao encompasses three kinds of leisurely delight. The first is *tranquil leisure*: when the practitioner externally quiets all conditions, single-mindedly enters meditation, and internally generates a stillness of pure peace, putting an end to the disturbance of worldly toil—this is the true beginning of entering the Dao. The second is *secluded leisure*: as poetry speaks of the “recluse,” one retreats to the peaks and riverbanks, delights in one’s own aspirations, seeks neither fame nor advancement, contends not with kings and lords, and spends each day in carefree ease—moving with the white clouds in their unfolding and closing, sharing the unbounded freedom of waterfowl. Such is the “idle Daoist.” Once the foundation of the elixir is attained, one may preserve and nurture the sacred embryo, living for decades as a lofty hermit—yet only those who have seen through glory and set their hearts on simplicity can achieve this.\n\nLong ago, Chan Master Zuoxi Shanlang wrote to Chan Master Yongjia Jue during their mountain retreat: “Since arriving at Lingxi, my mind and will have been at peace. I wander with my staff among the high and low peaks, sit in meditation in stone chambers and cliffside niches, where green pines and azure pools give rise to their own moonlight. The wind sweeps the white clouds, and my gaze stretches a thousand miles. Fragrant flowers and ripe fruits are brought by the beaks of mountain birds; the cries of gibbons echo near and far. My hoe serves as a pillow, fine grass as my mat. The world’s strife and contention over self and others—only those whose hearts have not yet awakened engage in such things. If you have a moment, I hope you will visit.” This reveals the purport of *secluded leisure*!\n\nThe third is *pure leisure*. Chen Tuan wrote: “I see the world’s people busy—each as frantic as fire. Yet those who toil do not do so for themselves; if they toiled for themselves, it would be acceptable.” Shao Yaofu said: “A thousand miles cannot escape the clarity of two eyes; in a hundred years, not one person is seen at leisure.” And again: “Flowing water follows its course, the scene ever still; flowers fall frequently, yet the mind remains at ease. Unlike worldly people, who age in idleness, never once in their lives breaking into a smile.” Zhou Maoshu remarked: “In the red dust and white sun, no one is at leisure—how much less one bound by official robes and sashes!” Chen Baisha observed: “Both marketplace and mountains have their affairs; what modern people call busy, the ancients called leisure.” Clearly, the blessing of *pure leisure* is most difficult to attain.\n\nWorldly people rush about day after day, year after year in tumult, with never a moment’s respite for body or mind. Only Daoists enjoy the blessing of pure stillness and leisure. Thus, an ancient worthy said: “Among the toils of life, only monks are free from affairs. If one awakens to the true vehicle, one grows even more at leisure in old age. In a garden with three paths, the Chan nature remains; in a thatched hut, the Dao mind returns with the wind and moon.” The Qing Emperor Shizu declared: “A hundred years—thirty-six thousand days—cannot compare to half a day’s leisure for a monk.” Master Yuchan wrote: “There is but one thing in which I surpass others: even emperors lack this pure leisure.”\n\nTo enjoy the blessing of *pure leisure* stems from having no desires in the breast, releasing the mind into utter emptiness. Thus, one can withdraw, return to the mountains, dwell in tranquil seclusion, rest in serene stability, and abide in boundless harmony—where wondrous function is naturally sufficient. Chan Master Weizhong Fu wrote: “After Zhang Liang no longer prized his noble title, how could he bear to record his merits on the imperial tower? Winning a leisurely body with nothing to do, he often wandered by the water with Red Pine.” This is what Chan Master Yongjia Xuanyue called “the idle Daoist who has abandoned learning and effort.”\n\nAn ancient worthy said: “The ‘idle Daoist’ is one who accords with the Dao, unconstrained by worldly toil. His eyes roam through the ages, his mind rests in a single realm. By water and beneath trees, he nurtures the sacred embryo, finding freedom in the moonlight, at ease in the sound of springs—thus is he called the ‘idle Daoist who has abandoned learning and effort.’”\n\nIn the Song dynasty, Chao Wenyuan’s *Fragments of Gold* states: “Someone asked: What is the joy of living in leisure? I replied: It is to harmonize and smooth the qi of Great Harmony, to savor the flavor of Heavenly Truth, to study subtle and profound words, to wander in the most wondrous Dao, to share the lofty sentiments of Master Zhuang, to befriend the transformations of nature, to grasp the sublime teachings of India, and to refine the spirit.”\n\nI say: If one can still both thoughts and extinguish them, wandering in the realm of *wuheyou* (“nothing whatsoever”), roaming in the vastness of *Fenghong*—this is indeed the ultimate journey of Zhuangzi’s “forgetting and ease.”",

If the body is at leisure while the mind is not—thoughts surging like tides, friends and concerns crowding the heart—this cannot truly be called leisure. Those of higher attainment may have a mind at leisure while the body is not, as when Confucius journeyed through the states; yet even this does not compare to Vimalakīrti’s illness in Vaiśālī. When both body and mind are at leisure, as when the World-Honored One rests in the ocean of *mahāparinirvāṇa*, this is the highest state.\n\nLü Dongbin said: “A day of pure leisure is a day as an immortal; the six spirits harmonize and all is naturally at peace.” Master Yinshan said: “In a three-room thatched hut I have always dwelt; a single ray of spiritual light makes all realms at leisure.” Chan Master Yongming Yanshou said: “Best is when in stillness nothing stirs, and the sprout of the Dao grows effortlessly alone”—he was called the “Master of No Affairs,” a rare attainment indeed. Leisure of both body and mind is most conducive to the practice of the Dao. When the mind and breath are harmonized, one wanders in the realm of *wuheyou* (“nothing whatsoever”), the state of *xiyi* (“rare and subtle”), which Zhuangzi called “wandering in Heaven.” Zhi Gong said: “In the light of formlessness, one is ever at ease.” Yuanwu said: “Entering the realm of equality and tranquility,” and again: “Together entering the dharma-nature ocean of non-action and no-affairs.” These are all the subtle principles of “wandering in Heaven,” and so *Zhuangzi* says: “Without the Heavenly wandering of the mind, the six senses vie in confusion.”\n\nWhen external circumstances do not disturb, the body is at peace; when the inner mind is still, the heart is at peace. Leisure of body and mind is the foundation of entering the Dao; emptiness and stillness of body and mind are its beginning. Only through stillness can samādhi arise, and in all cases, leisure is the condition for entering the Dao. Dongshan said: “Releasing all, sit upright; white clouds deeply enter leisure.” This is the leisurely spirit of Chan. Lü Dongbin said: “Do not say the recluse has nothing to do—within leisure lies the work of stillness. After reading in the quiet of a closed room by day, sweep the floor, burn incense until dusk.” *Zhuangzi* said: “In such a state, the mind is at leisure and without affairs.” Master Yuchan said: “A single leisurely guest, with nothing weighing on the heart.” Su Dongpo said: “The perfected one awakens to a single word: the Dao gathers from inner emptiness. The mind at leisure reflects itself, bright as a lotus.” Zhang Sanfeng said: “Stillness disturbed is not true stillness; only in leisure can one find peace.” This is the leisurely spirit of the Esoteric Dao.\n\nShao Yaofu said: “In leisure, the flavor is true; in truth, one is a child of Heaven.” And again: “In leisure, observe the waxing and waning of years; in stillness, illumine the being and non-being of heaven and earth.” And again: “Observe human affairs from the stillness of embodiment; refine the emotions of things in the freedom of leisure. Dispel all waves to preserve the still water—what in the world cannot be made level?” Zhou Maoshu said: “Only in leisure is one a man of understanding; busyness is but a life of toil.” Wang Yangming said: “In leisure, the mind is like empty water; in stillness, the subtle workings of Heaven become visible.” This is the leisurely spirit of the Confucians.\n\nOur Buddha, the World-Honored One, having realized bodhi, dwells in constant bliss—this is the ultimate tranquility. **77. Retreat is most steadfast.**\n\nThe *Xugua Zhuan* of the *Book of Changes* says: “Retreat means withdrawal.” The *Dun* hexagram states: “Good retreat brings good fortune to the noble person, but not to the petty person.” And again: “Excellent retreat is steadfast and auspicious; abundant retreat brings no disadvantage.” The *Xiangci* of the *Daguo* hexagram says: “The noble person stands alone without fear, retreats from the world without vexation.” The *Zhongyong* says: “The noble person abides in the Mean; though unseen in retreat, he does not regret—only the sage can do this.” The Confucian tradition extols the virtue of reclusion to the utmost.\n\nIn the *Daodejing*, “wearing coarse cloth while holding jade” is retreat; “achieving merit and fame, then withdrawing the body” is retreat; “blending one’s light and merging with the dust” is also retreat. Yet these are but the actions of one who retreats from the world, not the ultimate retreat. When the spirit of the self enters the cavern of qi to nurture it, withdrawing and concealing in secrecy, ultimately transforming together with breath, entering true emptiness, returning to the Great Void—body and mind utterly still, roots and realms both within and without extinguished—this may be called retreat of both body and mind, utterly without trace, leaving no footprint, like the horn of the antelope hanging in the air. This is the ultimate retreat, and the *Book of Changes*’ “excellent retreat” and “abundant retreat” also contain this meaning.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: “The Gate of Heaven is non-being; within the non-being of non-being, the sage conceals himself.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “Returning to the hidden origin, the inner light illumines the body.” And again: “Between the dark and the new moon, the tally moves within; the primordial chaos of *hongmeng*, the union of yin and yang, fluids moistening and flowing, circulating without obstruction. The spirits of heaven and earth are beyond measure; their use is to secure the body, concealing form and hiding.” Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* says: “Conceal the heart in the abyss, beautifying the spiritual root.” This is the true work of retreat and concealment in the Esoteric Dao—not merely dwelling in mountain forests where no human trace reaches.\n\n**78. Compassion is most auspicious.**\n\nAmong the Three Treasures of the Old Sage, compassion comes first. It is said: “Through compassion, one becomes brave.” And again: “With compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense. Heaven will save him, guarding him with compassion.” And again: “Thus the sage is always good at saving people, and so leaves no one behind; always good at saving things, and so leaves nothing behind. The sage in the world is reverent, blending the hearts of all under heaven. The hundred clans fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage treats them all as children.”",
      "overlap_context": "to savor the flavor of Heavenly Truth, to study subtle and profound words, to wander in the most wondrous Dao, to share the lofty sentiments of Master Zhuang, to befriend the transformations of nature, to grasp the sublime teachings of India, and to refine the spirit.”\n\nI say: If one can still both thoughts and extinguish them, wandering in the realm of *wuheyou* (“nothing whatsoever”), roaming in the vastness of *Fenghong*—this is indeed the ultimate journey of Zhuangzi’s “forgetting and ease.”",

      "translated_text": "It is also said: “Repay resentment with virtue. For the good, I treat them with goodness; for the ungood, I also treat them with goodness—thus virtue is perfected in goodness.” All this illustrates the practice of the great compassion samādhi. The bodhisattva cultivates the Four Immeasurables (loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity), yet takes compassion as the foremost guide, which suffices to prove the shared ground between Buddhism and Daoism. Those who study the immortal arts extend benevolence even to insects, refraining from harming any sentient being. With a compassionate heart, they embrace all beings, teaching and transforming them according to their capacities, gradually leading them out of the苦海 of birth and death to ascend the shore of the Dao. In this way, they embody the gateway of the Old Sage’s great compassion, becoming the upright banner of the teachings beneath the pillar.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Departure from the Worldly” chapter expounds ten kinds of compassion, which may serve as the paradigm for the great compassion practices of both Buddhism and Daoism, and as the bridge for guiding beings in the degenerate age. The sūtra states:\n\n“The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of pure compassion. What are the ten?\n1. **Compassion of equal mind**, pure because it universally embraces all beings without discrimination;\n2. **Compassion of bestowing benefit**, pure because whatever is done brings joy;\n3. **Compassion of regarding beings as oneself**, pure because it ultimately leads all out of birth and death;\n4. **Compassion of not abandoning the world**, pure because the mind constantly contemplates the accumulation of good roots;\n5. **Compassion that brings about liberation**, pure because it universally enables beings to eradicate all afflictions;\n6. **Compassion that gives rise to bodhi**, pure because it universally inspires beings to seek the mind of omniscience;\n7. **Compassion unhindered by the world**, pure because it radiates great light, illuminating all equally;\n8. **Compassion that fills empty space**, pure because it saves and protects beings without fail, wherever they may be;\n9. **Compassion bound to the Dharma**, pure because it realizes the true suchness of reality;\n10. **Compassion without conditions**, pure because it enters bodhi, free from the nature of birth.\n\nThese are the ten. All bodhisattvas who abide in this Dharma attain the Tathāgata’s supreme, vast, and pure compassion.”\n\nI observe: When the Old Sage says, “For the good, I treat them with goodness; for the ungood, I also treat them with goodness,” is this not “universally embracing all beings without discrimination”? When it is said, “Always good at saving people, and so leaves no one behind; always good at saving things, and so leaves nothing behind,” is this not “saving and protecting beings without fail, wherever they may be”? When it speaks of “blending the hearts of all under heaven,” restoring them to the uncarved simplicity of infancy and the unfeeling innocence of a newborn, is this not the “compassion of not abandoning the world”? When it says, “Constant virtue does not depart; constant virtue does not err, returning to the limitless, returning to nothingness,” is this not the “compassion that brings about liberation”? When it teaches, “Without knowledge, without desire, revealing the plain and embracing the uncarved, purifying to become the norm under heaven—who can stir the turbid to gradually clear?” and further, “Attain the utmost emptiness, guard the profound stillness; while the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return. Things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life; returning to life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination,” is this not the “compassion bound to the Dharma”? When it speaks of “dwelling in good earth, the mind like a deep abyss, befriending goodness, speaking with sincerity, governing with uprightness, handling affairs with skill, and acting at the right time”—these seven all exemplify “the highest goodness is like water, which benefits the ten thousand things without contention, accomplishing its work yet not dwelling in it”—is this not the “compassion without conditions”? Thus, the gateway of the Old Sage’s great compassion practice aligns in secret with the *Avataṃsaka*.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* “Entry into the Dharma Realm” chapter, when the youth Sudhana visits the eighteenth kalyāṇamitra, King Great Light in the city of Wondrous Light, he is taught the gateway of the great compassion banner, which deeply accords with the Old Master’s principle of “taking great compassion as foremost, relieving suffering and bestowing joy.” From this, one may also perceive the wondrous responsiveness of great compassion, which transcends the reach of thought and discourse—truly, it is the Buddha’s supreme virtue in transforming others. The sūtra states:\n\nAt that time, the king declared: “Good son, I have purely cultivated the bodhisattva’s practice of the great compassion banner; I have fulfilled the bodhisattva’s practice of the great compassion banner. Good son, in the presence of immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of buddhas, beyond reckoning or description, I inquired into this Dharma, pondered, observed, cultivated, and adorned it. Good son, I take this Dharma as my sovereign; with this Dharma, I instruct; with this Dharma, I embrace; with this Dharma, I follow the world; with this Dharma, I guide beings; with this Dharma, I lead beings to cultivate practice; with this Dharma, I lead beings to enter the path; with this Dharma, I provide expedient means; with this Dharma, I inspire beings to be imbued; with this Dharma, I arouse beings to action; with this Dharma, I establish beings in contemplating the self-nature of all dharmas; with this Dharma, I establish beings in the mind of compassion. Taking compassion as the foundation, perfecting the power of compassion, I thus enable them to abide in benefit. With a mind of joy, a mind of pity, a mind of embrace, a mind of guarding beings without abandonment, a mind of tirelessly relieving the suffering of beings—through this Dharma, I enable all beings to attain ultimate bliss, ever delighting in themselves, as if their bodies were free from all suffering, their minds purified, cutting off the craving for birth and death, delighting in the joy of the true Dharma, washing away the defilements of afflictions, shattering the obstructions of evil karma, severing the flow of birth and death, entering the ocean of true Dharma, cutting off all attachments, seeking omniscience, purifying the ocean of the mind, and generating unshakable faith. Good son, I have abided in this practice of the great compassion banner and am able to teach and transform the world with the true Dharma. Good son, in my land, all beings have no fear of me. Good son, if there are beings who are poor and destitute, coming to me with requests, I open my treasuries and storehouses, allowing them to take freely, saying to them: ‘Do not commit evil, do not harm beings, do not arise views, do not generate attachments. You who are poor and lacking—if there is anything you need, come to me and to the four directions; all things, in great variety and abundance, are here for you to take as you wish. Do not hesitate or doubt.’”",

My heart grieves with compassion and desires to save and protect them, so I enter the gateway of the bodhisattva’s samādhi, with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world. When I enter this samādhi, all the fearful, afflictive, demonic, and contentious minds of those beings instantly vanish. Why is this so? Because when one enters the bodhisattva’s samādhi with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world, the Dharma is thus.\n\nGood son, wait but a moment, and you shall witness it yourself. Then King Great Light entered this samādhi, and within his city, six kinds of tremors arose. The jeweled ground, jeweled walls, jeweled halls, jeweled palaces, terraces, pavilions, towers, stairways, doors, and windows—all emitted wondrous sounds, each bowing in reverence toward the king. All the inhabitants of the Radiant Light City simultaneously rejoiced and leapt with joy, prostrating themselves before the king. From villages, encampments, and cities, all people came to see the king, rejoicing and bowing in reverence. Even the birds and beasts near the king’s dwelling gazed at one another, arousing minds of compassion, and all bowed in reverence before the king. Every mountain, plain, and all grasses and trees turned toward the king in reverence. Ponds, pools, springs, wells, rivers, and seas all surged and overflowed, flowing before the king. Ten thousand dragon kings raised great clouds of fragrance, flashing lightning and rumbling thunder, pouring down a fine, gentle rain. Ten thousand deva kings—such as King Śakra of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, King Yama of the Suyāma Heaven, King Tuṣita of the Tuṣita Heaven, King Nirmāṇarati of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven, and King Paranirmitavaśavartin of the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven—led the host, playing wondrous music in the sky. Countless celestial maidens sang praises, raining down clouds of innumerable flowers, clouds of incense, clouds of jeweled garlands, clouds of jeweled robes, clouds of jeweled canopies, and clouds of jeweled banners, adorning the sky in offering to the king. The great elephant king Airāvaṇa, by his sovereign power, spread countless jeweled lotus flowers in the sky, hanging countless jeweled necklaces, jeweled ribbons, jeweled garlands, jeweled ornaments, jeweled flowers, and jeweled incense, adorned with all manner of wondrous embellishments. Countless celestial maidens sang praises in various melodies.\n\nWithin Jambudvīpa, there were further countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of rākṣasa kings, yakṣa kings, kumbhāṇḍa kings, and piśāca kings—some dwelling in the great seas, others on land, drinking blood and devouring flesh, harming beings—yet all aroused minds of compassion, wishing to act for the benefit of others, clearly discerning future lives, refraining from evil, and joining their palms in reverence, bowing their heads to the king. Just as in Jambudvīpa, so too in the other three continents, and even throughout the three-thousand great-thousand worlds, extending to the ten directions in hundreds of thousands of myriads of nayutas of worlds, all poisonous and evil beings were likewise transformed.\"\n\nThe great compassion banner practice cultivated by King Great Light, and the great compassion samādhi he entered, moved even grasses, trees, birds, and beasts to bow in reverence. Towers and jeweled pavilions emitted wondrous sounds in praise, bowing in reverence—truly inconceivable. For when compassion pervades the world, both sentient and insentient beings throughout the world are moved without exception. The power of the mind is boundless, and thus the power of compassion is boundless. The mutual resonance of response and Dao is beyond all reckoning.\n\nIn the degenerate age of the final kalpa, when strife and conflict are entrenched, humans slaughter one another, blood flows like a river, and bombardments reduce cities to ruins—apart from taking the bodhisattva’s gateway of practice, with great compassion as its foremost, following the ways of the world, how else could one transform their poisonous minds, avert this great calamity, and restore harmony among all beings?\n\nConfucius said, *\"Repay resentment with uprightness, and repay virtue with virtue.\"* Yet Laozi taught, *\"Repay resentment with virtue,\"* treating friend and foe equally. Thus, the compassion of the sage Laozi surpasses that of the sage Confucius, equaling that of the Buddha, the World-Honored One.\n\nWhen the Perfected One Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty had completed his Daoist cultivation and awaited the imperial summons for his ascension, the summons was long delayed. One day, two azure youths and a white crane descended from the sky. The Perfected One thought the celestial decree had arrived, but one youth proclaimed an edict from the Most High, summoning Huan Kai to ascend to heaven—not Tao. At that time, Kai was serving the Perfected One Tao. Tao then said to him, *\"I have cultivated the Dao with utmost diligence. Why this prolonged delay in the world? I wish you to inquire on my behalf.\"* Three days later, Kai descended again to Tao’s chamber and said, *\"Your hidden merits are manifest. In compiling the *Bencao* (Materia Medica), you used gadflies and leeches as medicine. Though your work benefits people, it harms living creatures, and thus your ascension is delayed. After another twelve years, you shall be released.\"* The Perfected One then composed a separate *Bencao* using only herbs and plants that could replace living creatures. Later, he indeed achieved liberation through the body.\n\nThe Perfected One Sun Simiao of the Tang dynasty compiled the *Qianjin Fang* (Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold). A celestial being descended and said to him, *\"The prescriptions you have compiled harm living creatures. You shall become an immortal through liberation of the body, but you will not ascend lightly.\"* Sun Simiao then replaced the gadflies and leeches with herbs and plants, composing the *Qianjin Yifang* (Supplement to the Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold) in thirty scrolls.\n\nConsider this: if killing even the smallest creatures to save people runs counter to the will of Heaven, how much more so does the slaughter of fattened animals to fill one’s belly? The sage Laozi taught people to be compassionate toward others, urging them to always save living beings. Yet if one kills living creatures to fill the kitchen, does this not greatly contradict his teachings? Those who learn from the sage Laozi’s teachings on longevity but disregard his compassion toward others act out of selfishness and self-interest, their virtue deficient. They shall never succeed—this can be stated with certainty.",

      "translated_text": "Formerly, Master Wang told me: \"In cultivating oneself, emptiness and quiescence are the fundamental principle; in conducting oneself in the world, benevolence and compassion are the essentials. Yet what is called benevolence and compassion also divides into active and passive forms. Active compassion lies in relieving suffering and bestowing joy, in delivering and aiding sentient beings; passive compassion merely refrains from afflicting or harming any sentient being and restrains all actions that would disadvantage them. Mencius said: 'A man must first refrain from certain actions before he can act.' Thus, only by practicing passive compassion—refraining from afflicting all sentient beings—can one then relieve suffering and bestow joy, practicing active compassion with full strength. Beginners in compassionate practice may first cultivate passive compassion.\"\n\n**79. Sincerity Is Most Potent**\nMy late master taught: \"In cultivating the Dao, one must attain utmost sincerity and single-minded focus. This character *cheng* (sincerity) cannot be transmitted even between father and son, let alone between master and disciple. At the extreme of sincerity, even metal and stone yield.\" *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"There has never been one who remained unmoved by utmost sincerity; without sincerity, none can move others. Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can effect transformation, for utmost sincerity is spirit-like.\"\n\nI say: Sincerity is the true and real mind. Utmost sincerity is the mind’s essence concentrated into oneness, untouched by extraneous thoughts. It proceeds without calculating fortune or misfortune, gain or loss, harm or benefit, never looking back. With unwavering single-mindedness, it possesses the three powers of the mind: great faith, great courage, and great stability. When the firing process reaches this stage, the eight winds cannot shake it. The mind’s essence becomes dense and aligned, achieving unimpeded communion. Thus, it can resonate with the Dao and interact without obstruction. Without the mind of utmost sincerity, one can never achieve the Dao. This is the sole provision for the path to the Dao. All past sages and worthies perfected the Dao’s fruit within this. Scholars ought to set their minds to it!\n\n*The Perfect Wanderer’s \"True Admonitions\"* states: \"Once there was a man who loved the Dao but did not know its methods. Day and night, he faced a cypress tree and bowed to it, seeking longevity. After twenty-eight years, the tree blossomed abundantly, its sweetness like malt sugar. He ate of it and became an immortal. Some bowed to Mount Taihua and received the Dao from the Old Man of the Western Peak; others bowed to the Yellow River, and after ten years, the River Earl taught them the method of walking on water without drowning. There is no other reason for this—it is the power of utmost sincerity.\" Examples like Wang Xiang lying on ice to catch a carp or Geng Gong praying to a well to draw forth water are also cases of utmost sincerity. When the light of the mind is concentrated and unshaken, whether in movement or stillness, it can move things and achieve communion. This is what Buddhism calls \"the three realms are only mind.\"\n\n*The Book of Master Lie*’s \"Emperor Huang\" chapter relates: \"The Fan family had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state admired him, and he was favored by the Lord of Jin. Though he did not hold office, he ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state ennobled; whatever he spoke ill of, the state demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court’s officials. Zihua had his retainers attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, bully the weak, and though they were wounded before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his amusement, and the state nearly became accustomed to it.\n\nTwo men, He Sheng and Zi Bo, discussed Zihua’s fame and power, saying he could make the living die and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. He borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s disciples were all from noble families, dressed in fine silk and riding grand carriages, walking slowly with haughty gazes. Seeing Shang Qiu Kai—old, weak, dark-faced, and poorly dressed—they all sneered at him. Soon, they mocked and deceived him, stopping at nothing. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks were simple, exhausted by their taunts.\n\nThen, they all ascended a high terrace. Amid the crowd, someone casually said: 'Whoever can throw themselves down will be rewarded with a hundred gold.' The crowd all clamored to comply. Shang Qiu Kai believed it was true and jumped first. His form soared like a bird, landing lightly on the ground without injury. The Fan family’s followers thought it a coincidence and did not yet find it strange.\n\nThey then pointed to a deep bend in the river and said: 'There is a treasure pearl in there; you can swim to retrieve it.' Shang Qiu Kai again swam after it. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to suspect. Zihua then ordered that he be given meat, fine clothes, and silk. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan family’s storehouse. Zihua said: 'Whoever can enter the fire to retrieve brocade will be rewarded according to how much they bring out.' Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the flames. Not a speck of dust clung to him, nor was his body scorched.\n\nThe Fan family’s followers, believing him to possess the Dao, all apologized: 'We did not know you possessed the Dao and deceived you; we did not know you were a divine person and humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, or blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?'\"",

      "translated_text": "The person of utmost sincerity can move all things. Stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without obstruction—how could this be limited to treading perilous paths or entering water and fire? If even Shang Qiu Kai, deceived by false things, remained unobstructed, how much more so when both self and other are sincere? Take heed, disciples!\n\nThis passage describes the efficacy of perfect sincerity, all arising from the congealing of the heart’s light and the singularity of focused sincerity. For those who cultivate the Dao, when the firing times reach this stage, the elixir may be formed. Shang Qiu Kai could cast himself to the ground unharmed, swim through water without drowning, and enter fire without scorching—all because his body and mind remained unmoved, so that events merged with principle and things could not oppose him. This is what is meant by \"harmony enters the great sameness with things.\"\n\nAlas! The function of sincerity is indeed supreme.\n\n---\n\nThe eighty-first chapter, *Hui Zui Chao* (Supreme Wisdom)\n\nSincerity is the congealing of the heart’s essence into oneness, without falling into a second thought—this belongs to the power of concentration. When concentration reaches its peak, illumination arises, and unimpeded wisdom manifests. This is the power of wisdom.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Correctness leads to stillness, stillness to clarity, clarity to emptiness.\" It also says: \"That and this find no counterpart—this is called the pivot of the Dao. When the pivot is grasped at the center of the circle, it can respond to the infinite. This is one infinity, that is another infinity—thus it is said: nothing compares to clarity.\" Again: \"When one follows the inner communication of the ears and eyes while transcending the knowledge of the heart-mind, even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so humans? This is the transformation of the ten thousand things.\" And: \"Only after one has transcended life externally can one attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, one can see the solitary. Seeing the solitary, one can transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, one can enter the realm of neither birth nor death.\"\n\nThe commentary states: Clarity, penetration, and morning clarity—all are states where wisdom arises. Clarity is the radiance of the heart’s light, illuminating all dharmas with perfect illumination—this is the wondrous luminosity of original wisdom. With original wisdom, all realms are pervaded and embraced without obstruction or stagnation. When realm and wisdom interpenetrate, self and other become identical, allowing one to transform adversity and prosperity, life and death, at will—all perfectly fitting. This is the wondrous function of the center of the circle, enabling one to respond to conditions and interact with beings with infinite transformation.\n\nIn the *Great Master* chapter, this is also called \"Zhan Ming\" (Illuminating Clarity), referring to this same wondrous luminosity. Moreover, \"the inner communication of the ears and eyes\" signifies the perfect realization of the one mind, while \"transcending the knowledge of the heart-mind\" means departing from the deluded knowledge of the six senses. This is the true state where wisdom arises—seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, the six senses restored, different natures merging into sameness, the solitary radiance of spiritual light transcending the roots and dust. This is what is called true knowing.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Only after there is a true person is there true knowing; knowing arises from not-knowing.\" Guan Yinzi says: \"Knowing yet forgetting emotion, being capable yet not acting—this is true knowing and true capability.\" I note: The phrase \"knowing yet forgetting emotion\" deeply accords with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s principle of \"knowing without seeing, which is the untainted purity of nirvāṇa.\" The phrase \"knowing arises from not-knowing\" especially resonates with the Chan school’s saying of \"the first glimmer of awareness in the skull without perception.\" This is indeed the crux of the Daoist school’s wisdom and the ultimate teaching of Lao-Zhuang’s mind-ground Dharma.\n\nThus, the Chan master Sanping’s verse says:\n*\"This seeing and hearing are not the mind’s hearing,\nNo other colors or sounds can be presented to you.\nWithin this, if you fully understand, all is settled—\nSubstance and function pose no obstacle, whether divided or undivided.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One Miaozheng says: \"Only when seeing and hearing are extinguished within seeing can one attain the great rest.\" The Perfected One Ziyang says: \"When encountering realms, if the mind is absent, only then can one see the face of bodhi.\" All these express the profound principle of \"knowing yet forgetting emotion.\"\n\nSuch clear seeing of one’s nature is true wisdom, also called the wisdom of thusness, untainted wisdom, unstained wisdom, unmoving wisdom, the wisdom of all-wisdom, and the wisdom of self-awakened sagacity. The *Lotus Sūtra* states: \"The Tathāgata appears in the world to open, show, awaken, and cause entry into the Buddha’s knowledge and vision\"—this refers precisely to this. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *Departing the Worldly* chapter says:\n\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of discriminating wisdom. What are the ten? They are: the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among sentient beings, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among faculties, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of karmic retribution, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of rebirth, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among worlds, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among buddhas, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions among dharmas, the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of the three times, and the wisdom of knowing the distinctions of all languages and paths—these are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the Tathāgata’s supreme, vast, and boundless discriminating wisdom.\"\n\nIt also says:\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of wisdom that follow awakening. What are the ten? They are: the wisdom that follows awakening to the immeasurable distinctions of all worlds, the wisdom that follows awakening to the inconceivable distinctions among all sentient beings, the wisdom that follows awakening to all dharmas entering one into many and many into one, the wisdom that follows awakening to the vastness of the entire dharma realm, the wisdom that follows awakening to the ultimate nature of all space, the wisdom that follows awakening to all worlds entering the past, the wisdom that follows awakening to all worlds entering the present and future, the wisdom that follows awakening to all the immeasurable vows and practices of the tathāgatas being perfectly fulfilled in one wisdom, and the wisdom that follows awakening to all buddhas of the three times attaining liberation through the same practice—these are the ten. If bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they attain the autonomous luminosity of all dharmas, fulfilling all vows in a single thought-moment, instantly comprehending all buddha-dharmas, and attaining perfect enlightenment.\"\n\nIt further states:\n\"The bodhisattva mahāsattva possesses ten kinds of wisdom that give birth to wisdom. What are the ten?\"",

In a single eon, there may be a hundred koṭis of buddhas appearing, a hundred thousand koṭis of buddhas appearing, or an uncountable, immeasurable, boundless, incomparable, innumerable, inconceivable, unmeasurable, inexpressible number of buddhas appearing—even an inexpressible, inexpressible number beyond all calculation. All such tathāgatas arise in the world, along with their assemblies at the bodhimaṇḍa, their voice-hearers and bodhisattvas, their teachings and subduing of beings, the lifespans of all beings, and the duration of the Dharma—all of this is clearly perceived. Just as in one eon, so too in all eons. Even in eons without buddhas, all sentient beings who plant roots of goodness for anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi are fully known. If there are sentient beings whose roots of goodness have matured and who will encounter a buddha in the future, this too is fully known. Observing the past for inexpressible, inexpressible eons in this way, the mind is never wearied—this is the sixth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva enters the future and observes, discerning all eons—immeasurable and boundless—knowing which eons have buddhas and which do not, how many tathāgatas appear in each eon, the names of each tathāgata, the worlds they inhabit, the names of those worlds, the number of beings they liberate, and their lifespans. Observing in this way throughout the entire future, all is fully known without exhaustion, yet without weariness—this is the seventh ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva enters the present and contemplates, observing in each thought-moment all the immeasurable, inexpressible worlds of the ten directions. In each, buddhas have attained, are attaining, or will attain supreme enlightenment. They approach the bodhimaṇḍa, sit beneath the bodhi-tree on auspicious grass, subdue the demon armies, and attain anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. Rising from there, they enter cities and ascend celestial palaces, expound the subtle Dharma, turn the great Dharma-wheel, display supernatural powers, and subdue beings. Finally, they entrust the Dharma of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, relinquish their lives, and enter parinirvāṇa. After entering parinirvāṇa, they compile the Dharma-store, ensuring its long abiding, and adorn stūpas with various offerings. They also see all beings in those worlds who encounter buddhas, hear the Dharma, receive and uphold it, recite and contemplate it, and develop wisdom. Observing in this way, they universally perceive the ten directions without error in the buddha-Dharma, entering the count of eons without weariness—this is the eighth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva, for inexpressible, inexpressible eons, in each eon, makes offerings and pays homage to inexpressible, inexpressible, immeasurable buddhas. Manifesting rebirth from one life to the next, they make offerings with all requisites surpassing the three realms, and also make offerings to bodhisattvas, voice-hearers, and all great assemblies. After each tathāgata enters parinirvāṇa, they make supreme offerings to the relics and widely practice generosity, fulfilling the needs of all beings and bodhisattvas. With inconceivable mind, non-seeking mind, ultimate mind, beneficent mind, and for inexpressible, inexpressible eons, they make offerings to the buddhas for the sake of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, benefit sentient beings, uphold the true Dharma, and expound it—this is the ninth ocean-like wisdom.\nThe bodhisattva mahāsattva, at a single buddha’s place, bodhisattva’s place, or dharma-teacher’s place, single-mindedly seeks the Dharma taught by bodhisattvas—learning, teaching, practicing, purifying, and the Dharma of total retention. Having obtained this Dharma, they receive, uphold, recite, and explain it without weariness, inspiring immeasurable beings to arouse the mind corresponding to omniscience in the buddha-Dharma, enter true reality, and attain non-retrogression in anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi.

      "translated_text": "Bodhisattvas, mahāsattvas, these are the ten ocean-like wisdoms of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi. If all bodhisattvas abide in this Dharma, they will attain the great wisdom-ocean of all buddhas’ supreme omniscience.”\n\nThe *Sutra of the Six Pāramitās* states:\n“Wisdom is the root,\nGiving rise to the sprout of wholesome dharmas.\nThe great bodhi-fruit of the buddhas\nIs wrought by nothing but wisdom.”\n\nThus it is known that the wisdom of the buddhas is most transcendent and supreme. From the Song and Yuan dynasties onward, those immortals who realized the Dao—such as Sanfeng, Ziyang, and Miaozheng—all fully awakened to the One Mind, subtly accorded with true reality, and truly entered wisdom. They may be considered equal in measure to the patriarchs of the Chan school.\n\n81. **Abandoning the Most Difficult**\n\nThe *Compendium of Divine Immortals* records that the Dark Emperor perfected the Dao and ascended from the Flying Ascension Cliff on Mount Wudang, demonstrating to disciples the essential principle of abandoning the body. The venerable Laozi taught, “Put the body outside, place it behind”—this is the meaning of abandoning the body. Master Tan’s “forgetting form, forgetting qi, forgetting spirit” is also the practice of abandoning the body. Alas, how deeply worldly people cling to attachment! Even external wealth and possessions they are unwilling to relinquish—how much less this body? My late teacher lamented this and composed *The Three Teachings Unified*, teaching everywhere that one must abandon this corporeal form and nurture spirit, regulate breath, in the emptiness beyond the body.\n\nIn the *General Explanation of the Unified Teaching*, it is said:\n“The great Way of the Golden Elixir is entirely a matter of the emptiness beyond the body. If even the slightest thought clings to the post-heaven corporeal form, it is already off by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not be formed.”\n\nHe also once told me:\n“To speak of it in ultimate terms, saying it has no connection with this body is still superficial. The practice must be carried to the point where it has no relation whatsoever to mind, knowing, intention, or consciousness—only then is it true pre-heaven. Not only must the corporeal form be abandoned, but the mind and consciousness must also be relinquished. Only when one reaches the state of great samādhi and true samādhi, the realm of emptiness of both body and mind, does one accord with the profound meaning of ‘putting the body outside yet preserving it,’ and personally realize what is prior to the image of the Lord. One transcends the other shore of Sound-Before-Sound. When cultivation reaches this point, reversing aging and restoring youth becomes as easy as turning one’s palm.”\n\nMy late teacher, in replying to Meng Junhan on the meaning of abandoning the body, said:\n“These two words, ‘abandoning the body,’ are most crucial. Let me explain further. Disciples must first know that only by relinquishing the corporeal form can one cultivate the Dharma-body. The corporeal form, being formed, is inevitably subject to decay; the Dharma-body, being formless, is truly real. If one does not first abandon the post-heaven corporeal form, the pre-heaven Dharma-body cannot ascend. The scriptures say: When the heart dies, the spirit lives; when the consciousness-spirit is extinguished, the original spirit appears. *Laozi* says: ‘Place it behind, and it comes first; put it outside, and it is preserved.’ It also says: ‘Put it outside, and it is cultivated; forget the form, and the form is perfected.’ ‘My greatest worry is that I have a body; if I had no body, what worry would I have?’ Confucius said: ‘If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.’ Lüzu said: ‘To kill life after it is born, to learn death before one dies—this is long life.’ All these teach one to abandon the corporeal form and cultivate the Dharma-body. Bai Yuchan said: ‘A word or half a phrase can penetrate the mystery—what need is there for a thousand or ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures? If one is not burdened by form, the Great Brahmā Heaven is right before one’s eyes.’ In learning the Dao, the greatest fear is clinging to the corporeal form.\n\nLet me make this even clearer: In all practice, if one feels even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring within the body, one must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. This is the true oral instruction of the two words ‘abandoning the body.’ Thus, the True Lord of Emptiness and Stillness said: ‘Let him do as he will, let him act as he pleases, pay him no mind—he is he, how can he affect me?’ Ponder this deeply!\n\nThe ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all speak of guarding against danger. But what danger is there in learning the Dao? What is this danger? In practice, if one feels even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring within the body, and does not swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside, this is great danger. Over time, it will surely lead to serious illness. But if one knows to swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside, there is no danger. Even if there are one or two, three or four instances of leakage, it is of no concern. With long practice, the illness of seminal leakage will naturally disappear. This is the verified effect of my own past practice.”\n\nHe also said:\n“If wandering thoughts arise and vanish of their own accord, this is precisely the danger of not swiftly turning to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. From now on, whenever you practice, if you feel even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest wandering thought in the mind, you must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. If you feel even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest stirring of internal qi within the body—whether it brings ease or joy—you must even more swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. If you feel even the slightest stirring, the faintest movement, or the briefest arousal of the yang organ, regardless of whether it is firm or soft, you must swiftly turn to the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside. Practice this for three months, and body and mind will naturally become still and settled, qi and blood will naturally harmonize and flow smoothly, and leakage will naturally cease. The effects are truly swift—do not take this lightly!\n\nI endured over twenty years of hardship seeking the oral instructions of a teacher, and this is precisely the oral instruction I sought. I see that you cling to images, words, and the snares of the corporeal form—this is truly lamentable. Thus, I speak from the depths of my heart to tell you this.\n\nIn sum, the great Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, entirely takes the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside the body as its starting point and its conclusion. Thus, the ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all say it is most simple and most easy. If even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest thought clings to the corporeal form, it is no longer most simple and most easy.”",

      "original_text": "噫！ 足下见信后行功时可速急舍身也”。 清·迦陵音禅师《宗鉴要》云：“参破工夫须是疑，破参之后，工夫须舍。 一切见闻觉知，乃至智慧德相，一事不舍，一事不圆； 一物不舍，一物不周。 疑舍二层工夫，疑易舍难”。 古人所以拼一生辛勤，不肯中止化成者，不自欺其心也。 宋·圆悟勤禅师云：“作家宗师，唯许人舍知见，胸中不留毫发，荡然如太虚空，悠久长养纯熟，此即本地风光，本来面目”。 又云：“行住坐卧，无不透彻，物物头头，靡有间隔，唤作乾白露净，单明自心，不可只么守之，守住便落窠臼，却须勇猛割断，十分弃舍，转舍转明，转远转近，抵死打叠，舍却命去，始是绝气死人，方解向上行履，唯己自知，知亦不立，释迦弥勒，文殊普贤，德山临济，不敢正眼觑着，岂不是奇特事”。 以上禅玄两家知识，开示舍字工夫，皆极绵密。 大抵学人入道，须时时能舍，不仅做工夫时为然也。 凡遇物情流连处，色习气现前时，均当提起金刚王宝剑，猛烈割断，不留余情。 攀缘心最难治，最妙处置办法，将其离开色身，而留住于虚空之中，渠一见空王，只得束手待毙，再无伎俩发展。 故玄宗凝神于虚，与息相委蛇，而相化于无形，相融乎大空，实为降心之妙法，舍身之秘藏，成真之捷径，超凡之宝筏。 自老圣留传至今，已历四千余年，祖祖相承，从无间断。 凡我好道之伦，有缘遇此，奚可不生庆幸，而坚志修习乎哉！ 八十二   平最稳 《庄子·庚桑楚》篇云：“欲静则气平，欲神则顺心”。 《德充符》篇云：“平者，水停之盛也，其可以为法也，内保之而外不荡也”。 《刻意》篇云：“夫恬淡寂漠，虚无无为，此天地之平，而道德之质也。 故曰：圣人休焉，休则平易矣，平易则恬淡矣。 平易恬淡，则忧患不能入，邪气不能袭，故其德全而神不亏”。 吕祖云：“无念方能静，静中气自平，气平息乃住，息住自归真”。 玄宗修持，入手工夫，先求其心平息平，此平字乃定象。 平之久，则入真定，真定则心息俱寂，妙协虚空矣。 《庄子》之“休乎天均”，平也，亦定也。 佛氏之“如如不动”，平也，亦定也。 天一之平，无过于停流之水。 至人心地无波，识浪全消，亦类于是，故能境智空，朗照靡遗矣。 《华严经》不云乎：“身心悉平等，内外解脱”。 《圆觉经》亦云：“善男子，虚空如是平等不动，当知觉性平等不动。 四大不动故，当知觉性平等不动。 如是乃至八万四千陀罗尼门平等不动，当知觉性平等不动”。 释曰：身心寂静如虚空则内外根尘，悉皆解脱，此《华严》平等意也。 熔万法于一心，等觉性于虚空，心境如如，寂然不动，此《圆觉》平等意也。 恬淡寂漠，虚无无为，正玄宗身心平等之妙也。 不荡不摇，休乎天均，正玄宗心境如如之验也。 玄宗心息相依，至一如境界，则内外身心悉皆平等一如，性色真空，性空真色，岂非解脱之捷径也耶！ 《楞严经·持地菩萨圆通章》云：”我于尔时，平等待佛，毗舍如来，摩顶谓我，当平心地，则世界地一切皆平。 我即心开，见身微尘，与造化世界所有微尘，等无差别，微尘自性，不相触摩。 佛问圆通，我已谛观二界尘，等无差别，本如来藏，虚妄发尘，尘销智圆，成无上道，斯为第一”。",
      "translated_text": "Alas! Once you have seen and believed, when practicing the work, swiftly and urgently abandon the body.”\n\nMaster Jialingyin of the Qing Dynasty states in *Essentials of Sectarian Inspection*: “The effort of breaking through must involve doubt; after breaking through, the effort must be abandoned. If even the slightest perception, hearing, awareness, or knowledge—even wisdom and virtuous attributes—is not relinquished, nothing will be complete; if even the smallest thing is not abandoned, nothing will be perfect. The two layers of effort—doubt and abandonment—are such that doubt is easy, while abandonment is difficult.”\n\nThis is why the ancients devoted their entire lives to diligent practice, refusing to halt their transformation midway: they would not deceive their own hearts. Master Yuanyu Qin of the Song Dynasty said: “A true master of the school permits only the abandonment of knowledge and views, leaving not even a hair’s breadth in the mind. Empty and vast like the great void, nurtured and ripened over time—this is the original scenery, the original face.”\n\nHe also said: “In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, there is nothing that is not thoroughly penetrated, no separation in any phenomenon. This is called ‘pure as the bright dew,’ the singular clarity of one’s own mind. Yet one must not merely guard it, for guarding leads to stagnation. Instead, one must bravely sever and utterly abandon it. The more one abandons, the clearer one becomes; the farther one turns away, the nearer one draws. Only by resolutely dismantling, casting aside one’s very life, does one become a corpse devoid of breath—then, and only then, can one tread the path beyond. This is known only to oneself; even knowledge is not established. Śākyamuni, Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, Deshan, Linji—none dare gaze directly upon it. Is this not a wondrous matter?”\n\nThe insights of both Chan and Daoist adepts on the effort of abandonment are exceedingly subtle and meticulous. Generally, those who enter the Way must be able to abandon at all times, not merely during practice. Whenever one encounters attachments to worldly affairs or the arising of habitual tendencies and sensory desires, one must wield the Diamond King’s precious sword, fiercely severing all without leaving the slightest residue. The mind of clinging is the most difficult to cure; the most wondrous method of dealing with it is to separate it from the corporeal body and lodge it within the emptiness of space. Once it beholds the King of Emptiness, it can only surrender, powerless to develop further schemes.\n\nThus, the profound tradition of refining spirit in the void, harmonizing with the breath, and dissolving into formlessness, merging with the great emptiness, is truly the wondrous method for subduing the mind, the secret treasury of abandoning the body, the swift path to attaining truth, and the precious raft for transcending the mundane. From the ancient sages to the present, over four thousand years have passed, with transmission from master to master unbroken. For those of us who love the Way and encounter this teaching, how can we not rejoice and resolutely commit to cultivation?\n\n---\n\nSection Eighty-Two: *Utmost Stability*\n\nThe *Gengsang Chu* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: “To attain stillness, let the qi be balanced; to attain spirit, let the heart be at ease.” The *Dechong Fu* chapter says: “Balance is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model, for inwardly it is preserved while outwardly it remains undisturbed.” The *Keyi* chapter states: “Serene, tranquil, still, and empty—non-action—this is the balance of heaven and earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue. Thus, when the sage rests, he attains balance and ease; with balance and ease comes serenity. With balance, ease, and serenity, worries and afflictions cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot invade. Thus, his virtue is whole, and his spirit is not diminished.”\n\nMaster Lü said: “Without thought, one can attain stillness; in stillness, the qi naturally balances. When the qi is balanced, the breath comes to rest; when the breath rests, one naturally returns to truth.”\n\nIn the cultivation of the profound tradition, the initial effort is first to seek balance of the heart and balance of the breath—this “balance” is the image of stability. With prolonged balance, one enters true stability; in true stability, heart and breath are both still, wondrously harmonizing with the void.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “resting in the harmony of heaven” is balance, and it is also stability. The Buddhist “thusness, unmoving” is balance, and it is also stability. The supreme balance of the One of Heaven is nothing more than the stillness of flowing water. The mind-ground of the perfected one is without waves, the billows of consciousness entirely stilled—this is akin to it. Thus, the realm of wisdom is empty, and illumination is without omission.\n\nDoes not the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* say: “When body and mind are entirely equal, inner and outer are liberated”? The *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* also states: “Good man, just as space is thus equal and unmoving, know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving. Because the four great elements are unmoving, know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving. Thus, even the eighty-four thousand dhāraṇī gates are equal and unmoving—know that the nature of enlightenment is equal and unmoving.”\n\nThe commentary explains: When body and mind are as still as space, then the inner and outer senses and their objects are all liberated—this is the meaning of equality in the *Avataṃsaka*. Melting all dharmas into the one mind, equating the nature of enlightenment with space, with mind and realm thus and unmoving—this is the meaning of equality in the *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment*. Serene, tranquil, still, and empty—non-action—this is the wondrous balance of body and mind in the profound tradition. Undisturbed and unshaken, resting in the harmony of heaven—this is the verification of the thusness of mind and realm in the profound tradition.\n\nWhen the heart and breath in the profound tradition mutually rely upon each other to reach the state of oneness, then the inner and outer, body and mind, are all entirely equal and one. The nature is the true emptiness of form, and the emptiness is the true form of nature—is this not the swift path to liberation?\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, in the *Chapter on the Perfect Penetration of Earth-Holding Bodhisattva*, states: “At that time, I treated all buddhas equally. Vipaśyin Buddha placed his hand on my head and said, ‘When the mind-ground is balanced, then the world and the earth are all balanced.’ My mind then opened, and I saw the fine dust of my body and all the fine dust of the world of creation—all were equal and without difference. The self-nature of fine dust does not mutually abrade. The Buddha asked about perfect penetration, and I had already carefully observed that the two realms of dust are equal and without difference, fundamentally the treasury of the Thus-Come One. When delusion arises as dust, and the dust dissolves, wisdom is perfected, and the unsurpassed Way is accomplished. This is the foremost.”",
      "overlap_context": "y lamentable. Thus, I speak from the depths of my heart to tell you this.\n\nIn sum, the great Way of the Golden Elixir, from beginning to end, entirely takes the mutual reliance of heart and breath outside the body as its starting point and its conclusion. Thus, the ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures all say it is most simple and most easy. If even the slightest flicker, the faintest movement, or the briefest thought clings to the corporeal form, it is no longer most simple and most easy.”",

      "translated_text": "This passage, through the balancing of the mind-ground, achieves the interpenetration of environment and wisdom, the equality of body and realm, and from this awakens to the Dao and attains fruition. The profound tradition proceeds from the equality of mind and breath to the equality of body and land, and from the non-duality of body and mind to the unimpeded union of emptiness and form—this too is the wondrous practice of balancing the mind-ground.\n\nSpeaking of the initial effort, the interdependence of mind and breath values attaining equilibrium. \"Equilibrium\" means the correspondence of two and eight—Master Huzi called it the \"balance of the qi mechanism.\" When balanced, there is harmony; when harmonious, there is stability. Master Sanfeng said: \"Concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath require only the mind to be balanced and the qi harmonious. When the mind is balanced, the spirit congeals; when the qi is harmonious, the breath is regulated. The character for 'balanced' is most wondrous: the mind without waves is called balanced, the mind abiding in the center is called balanced—this balance is precisely within this center. When the mind is in this center, it does not stir waves; this center is the *xuanguan* aperture of the alchemical classics.\"\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *On Regulating the Breath* states: \"What is 'not forgetting'? It is guarding the natural. What is 'not forcing'? It is following the natural. How to guard? By relying on the breath. How to follow? By balancing the breath. Relying on the breath allows the breath to connect with the breath; balancing the breath allows the breath to become even.\" Thus, the interdependence of mind and breath must be even and natural, only then is it called \"half a catty, eight taels\"—Ziyang’s \"two and eight correspond and naturally unite.\"\n\nFurthermore, at the moment yang arises in a single awareness, equilibrium is also valued. If awareness is too heavy, water prevails and fire is scant, and after ceasing practice, one feels an overflow of saliva; if awareness is too light, fire prevails and water is scant, and after ceasing practice, one feels a dry mouth and parched tongue. It must be neither heavy nor light—half a catty, eight taels—so that the fire phase naturally reaches the spirit’s awareness, and the spirit naturally departs the body, precisely attaining the proper measure, without excess or deficiency. This is what Master Sanfeng called \"the equal balance of firmness and softness,\" and also: \"The crow’s eight taels, the hare’s half catty—both enter the village of *wuji* together.\"\n\nThe cessation of the eighty-third [thought] is most wondrous. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Return and rest, my lord.\" And again: \"Rest in the evenness of heaven; rest and there is emptiness, emptiness and there is fullness, fullness and there is order.\" And again: \"Have we not spoken enough? Serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease.\" This is the essential principle of the profound tradition’s cessation of the mind.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"When the mad nature ceases of itself, cessation is bodhi.\" Master Baizhang said: \"First, cease all conditions, rest from all affairs. Whether good or evil, worldly or transcendent—all dharmas—do not recall or contemplate them. Release body and mind, let them be at ease. Let the mind be like wood or stone, without discrimination, without movement. When the mind-ground is empty, the sun of wisdom naturally appears, like the sun emerging when clouds disperse. Simply cease all clinging, greed, anger, love, and delusion; when the dust of defilement and purity is exhausted, remain unmoved by the five desires and eight winds. Unbound by perception, hearing, awareness, or knowledge, unconfused by any realm, one naturally possesses the wondrous functioning of spiritual penetrations—this is the liberated person.\"\n\nMaster Wushou said: \"It is only because greed and desire have become one’s nature that the twenty-five realms are tied to one’s heels, with no hope of accomplishment. The patriarchs transmitted only the mind-seal; those who attain it, whether ordinary or sagely, foolish or wise, immediately cease all conditions, suddenly rest from the ten thousand affairs, and transcend the stream of birth and death.\"\n\nMaster Deshan said: \"A single thought bound by the slightest attachment becomes the cause of the three evil destinies; a fleeting thought of passion becomes the fetter of ten thousand kalpas. One must, in the very place of one’s former conduct, suddenly cast off all bonds. When not a single thought arises, the continuity of the past is severed, and no dharma can touch the mind.\"\n\nMaster Xuansha said: \"Forget knowledge in serene illumination, empty and containing the ten thousand images. Release idle conditions, cease the mind’s consciousness—only then can one slightly approach intimacy. Otherwise, one is entirely carried away by the consciousness of discrimination, with no freedom at all.\"\n\nMaster Huangbo said: \"All sentient beings, ceaselessly revolving in birth and death, do so because the mind runs after conditions, not resting in the six paths, thus suffering all manner of afflictions.\"\n\n*Vimalakīrti* said: \"Those difficult to transform have minds like monkeys; therefore, with various methods, one must restrain and subdue the mind.\"\n\nMaster Furong said: \"If you do not cease now, when will you? If you can exhaust this moment, what further affairs remain?\"\n\nMaster Yuanwu said: \"Bodhisattvas practicing at home are like lotuses in fire. For titles, power, influence, and pride are most difficult to subdue. Moreover, in the burning house of worldly vexations, unless one directly awakens to the wondrous functioning of one’s original true nature, attains the great quiescent cessation, and can let go, becoming utterly ordinary and thoroughly realizing no-mind, one cannot succeed.\"\n\nThis is the wondrousness of the Chan school’s cessation of the mind.\n\nSince beginningless time, we have flowed through the six paths, enduring all hardships, only because we have not been able to thoroughly let go, thoroughly cease. If, in a single thought, cessation is sudden, the three times are all empty, the stream of birth and death is cut off—what further rebirth could there be? Therefore, in learning the Dao, one must first cease conditions, then cease thoughts, and cease the mind. \"Cessation\" means letting go of everything.\n\nThe profound tradition’s regulation of the breath, making the mind rely on the breath to gradually settle, is also a skillful method for ceasing the mind. When one reaches the point where breath and thought are both extinguished, and great stability is naturally attained, then all existences are empty, and inner and outer are entirely forgotten. When stability reaches its limit and transforms, the Dharma-body manifests and functions freely, like a silkworm’s cocoon transforming into a flying moth.\n\nThus, Confucius said: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\"",

      "translated_text": "Mencius said: \"Nurturing life is insufficient for great matters; only in sending off the dead can great matters be settled.\" This all teaches one to learn death before dying. When arising and ceasing are both extinguished, quiescent extinction appears before one, arriving at the realm of great rest and great cessation.\n\n*Zhuangzi* states: \"Have you ever wandered in the Palace of Nothingness? Together we merge and discourse—is there any end to it?\" It also says: \"Forget your liver and gall, abandon your ears and eyes, wander in boundless vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam carefree in the work of no-affairs.\" And again: \"Cast off your form, expel your intelligence, forget all relations and things, and merge into the vast primordial. Release the heart, liberate the spirit, and become utterly devoid of soul.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says: \"Separate from qi and absorb the constructive and defensive; the north (Kan) no longer employs hearing; the west (Dui) unites without speech. Rare words accord with the primal chaos. When these three are mastered, relax the body and dwell in an empty chamber. Entrust your will to the Void, making non-thought your constant state.\" This is precisely the wondrous practice of the profound tradition’s return to quiescence—where heart and breath wondrously merge with emptiness, allowing self-stabilization and self-transformation. Concealing brilliance and erasing radiance, undergoing a great death, only then does cold ash burst into flame, withered wood bloom anew. Nature is preserved, life is restored, and transcendence becomes possible.\n\n*The Liezi·Heaven’s Blessings* records: \"Zigong, weary of study, told Confucius: ‘I wish to rest.’ Confucius replied: ‘In life, there is no rest.’ Zigong asked: ‘Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?’ Confucius said: ‘You shall. Look upon that grave mound—its enclosure, its mound, its tomb, its vessel—then you will know where rest lies.’ Zigong exclaimed: ‘How great is death! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low there.’\" This too is the subtle teaching of the sages’ return to quiescence.\n\nTo find death within life, to let go at the precipice—arriving at the realm of great rest and great cessation, vast and level, the void shattered to dust. Lü Zu said: \"To kill life after it has arisen, to learn death before dying—this is longevity.\" The secret formula states: The emptiness beyond the body is our resting place, the vessel-like grave mound the sacred ground of quiescence. Roam carefree within it, until inner and outer are entirely forgotten, roots and realms both dissolved. Body and heart become utterly empty and unmoving, naturally returning to the root like fallen leaves, wondrously uniting with the Dao of true constancy.\n\nThe four characters—stabilization, forgetting, relinquishing, cessation—are the secret formulas of Daoist cultivation, the swift path to transcendence. Just as the saying goes: \"Trampled iron shoes in vain search, yet it comes without effort.\"\n\n---\n\nSection 84: *Heaven’s Work*\nThe ancient sages illuminated the \"infant’s conduct,\" while Zhuangzi revealed \"Heaven’s work.\" The infant’s conduct takes harmonious softness and pure sincerity without falsehood as its essence, demonstrating the uncarved simplicity of primal chaos—the sages’ teaching of returning to simplicity and restoring purity.\n\nHeaven’s work takes utmost emptiness and wondrous clarity as its foundation, returning the spirit to the beginningless, merging with the Great Unity, and becoming one with the Great Void—this is the wondrous Dao of returning to emptiness.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"One who is not clear about Heaven is not pure in virtue\"; \"Those who harmonize with Heaven are called Heaven’s joy. Those who know Heaven’s joy—while alive, their conduct is Heaven’s work; in death, they transform with things. At rest, they share virtue with yin; in motion, they move with the waves of yang\"; \"When arranged and departed, transformation enters the vast oneness of Heaven\"; \"Forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. Those who forget the self are said to enter Heaven\"; \"When schemes and plans are unused, one must return to Heaven\"; \"If the heart does not wander in Heaven, the six senses will clash\"; \"Emptiness and tranquility alone accord with Heaven’s virtue\"; \"Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, tranquil and non-active, moving as Heaven works—this is the Dao of nurturing the spirit.\"\n\n\"In the Dao of pure simplicity, only the spirit guards itself. Guard it without loss, and unite with the spirit. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heaven’s order\"; \"Heaven’s virtue emerges in tranquility, not departing from its origin—this is called the Heavenly person. When form and essence are not diminished, this is called the power to transform. Essence refined to the utmost returns to assist Heaven\"; \"Following this or that, following that or this—the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates with Heaven\"; \"Beginning and end are like a ring, with no discernible order—this is called Heaven’s balance. Heaven’s balance is Heaven’s boundary\"; \"Those who revere without joy, are insulted without anger—only those who harmonize with Heaven’s harmony are so. Who knows the eloquence of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? If one can know this, it is called Heaven’s treasury. Pour into it without filling, draw from it without exhausting, yet not knowing its source—this is called preserving brilliance\"; \"I am about to join the Creator as a companion. When weary, I ride the bird of boundless qi, emerging beyond the six directions to wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness of great emptiness\"; \"They are about to join the Creator as companions, roaming in the one qi of Heaven and Earth\"; \"Entering and exiting without revealing its form—this is called Heaven’s gate. Heaven’s gate is Nothingness. Yet in Nothingness, there is no Nothingness—this is where the sage conceals himself.\"\n\nThe above passages from *Zhuangzi* repeatedly expound the wondrousness of Heaven’s work. For the heart wanders in tranquility, qi merges with vastness, vast and empty as the Great Void, utterly without trace. Without moment or occasion, it transcends beyond the ten thousand existences, wondrously uniting with the image of the Lord before its manifestation. Still and luminous, quiescent and radiant, empty and natural—this is what is called Heaven’s work.",

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuangzi* speaks of \"illuminating vastness\" (昭旷), \"primordial obscurity\" (混溟), \"mysterious darkness\" (玄冥), \"boundless emptiness\" (参寥), \"Heaven’s gate\" (天门), \"Heaven’s balance\" (天均), \"Heaven’s order\" (天伦), \"Heaven’s treasury\" (天府), \"Heaven’s harmony\" (天和), \"Heaven’s joy\" (天乐), \"Heaven’s virtue\" (天德), and \"Heaven’s oneness\" (天一)—all are the purport of Heaven’s work. Its wondrousness lies in returning to oneness without trace, pervading all things without intent.\n\nThe *Buddha-Curve Sutra* calls Heaven’s work the \"royal samādhi of the Middle Way.\" When the mechanism of entering the Middle arises, Heaven’s work responds with compassion, like a donkey or horse seeing the shadow of a whip—proceeding along the great straight path, without before or after, neither merging nor separating. It teaches the Dharma of no-discrimination, for all dharmas from the very beginning bear the mark of constant quiescent extinction.\n\nI say that Heaven’s work is the practice of the vast and mysterious Dao, wondrously uniting with spontaneity. As Dongshan said: *\"One must ensure that the mind never touches things, step by step without fixed abode, ever unbroken—only then does one attain accord.\"* This is the meaning of Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"The Great Oneness flows through it\"* and *\"The Great Stillness holds it.\"* This precisely reveals the ultimate aim of Heaven’s work. For the Great Oneness is Heavenly nature, the Dharma-realm—it is the fundamental principle that does not depart from its source. When the mind flows through the One, this is called \"illuminating the source.\" After illuminating the source, one again *\"holds it with the Great Stillness.\"* With the purity of awakening and cultivation, the original substance is empty and vast, transcending the ten thousand images. Pervading all things without attachment, acting without intent—like the sun shining and the wind turning—only then does one accord with the wondrous Dao of Heaven’s work.\n\nGuan Yinzi said: *\"He dwells in the measure of no-excess, conceals himself in the beginningless thread, roams the beginning and end of the ten thousand things, unifies his nature, nurtures his qi, harmonizes his virtue, and thereby communicates with the source of all things.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Alone he wanders with the spirit of Heaven and Earth, without arrogance toward the ten thousand things. Above, he roams with the Creator; below, he befriends those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In responding to and dissolving things, his principle is inexhaustible, his coming untainted. Vague and obscure—who can fathom its depths?\"* And again: *\"The spirit flows in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit. Above, it observes Heaven; below, it coils upon the Earth. Transforming and nurturing the ten thousand things, it cannot be represented in image—its name is ‘coalescing with the Lord.’\"* This is the ultimate attainment of Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Book of Changes* says: *\"The ‘Adornment’ hexagram is without color. The ‘Following’ hexagram is without cause.\"* And again: *\"What does the world have to think or worry about? The world converges through different paths, unites through a hundred deliberations—what does the world have to think or worry about?\"* To awaken to the true emptiness of form and color, to wondrously unite with the source of the Dao, to synthesize the ten thousand transformations, to encompass Heaven and Earth—this is the Heaven’s work of the Sage Confucius.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram’s nine in the fifth place says: *\"The flying dragon is in Heaven—auspicious to see the great person\"* (the \"great person\" refers to the Dharma-body). The *Great Accumulation* hexagram’s top line says: *\"What thoroughfare of Heaven! Free and unobstructed!\"* (These line statements were composed by the Duke of Zhou, signifying the breakthrough of accumulated fullness, the image of boundless openness. *\"What thoroughfare of Heaven!\"* means: *How could it be so thoroughly open?*) This is the Duke of Zhou’s Heaven’s work.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: *\"The Mandate of Heaven—solemn and unceasing! Oh, how resplendent!\"* The purity of King Wen’s virtue—this is King Wen’s Heaven’s work.\n\n*\"Fasting of the mind, sitting in forgetfulness, departing from form, abandoning knowledge, merging with the Great Thoroughfare\"*—this is Yanzi’s Heaven’s work.\n\n*\"Utmost sincerity without ceasing, vast and deep, lofty and bright, enduring and boundless—even without display it is manifest, without movement it transforms, without action it accomplishes\"*—this is Zisi’s Heaven’s work.\n\nNature opens to Heaven’s clarity, the body unites with true emptiness. Caoshan said: *\"Harmoniously merged, without inside or outside, level and even above and below.\"* Dongshan said: *\"Harmoniously merged without concealment—what more could one seek?\"* This is the Heaven’s work of the Chan school.\n\nOne must also understand that the \"Heaven\" in Heaven’s work is not the Heaven opposed to Earth, but the fundamental principle of the vast and mysterious Dao—the Heaven of Nirvāṇa, the Heaven of the First Principle. The *Baojing Sanmei of the Dongzong* says: *\"Heavenly truth is wondrous, neither deluded nor awakened.\"* This wondrous Dao of Heavenly truth gives rise to the wondrous practice of non-action—this is called Heaven’s work.\n\n---\n\nThe *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* sets forth five kinds of practice: first, the *sacred practice* (聖行); second, the *pure practice* (梵行); third, *Heaven’s work* (天行); fourth, the *infant practice* (嬰兒行); and fifth, the *sick practice* (病行). The *Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sūtra* takes the sacred practice as the samādhi of the real truth, the pure practice, infant practice, and sick practice as the samādhi of the conventional truth, and Heaven’s work as the royal samādhi of the Middle Way.\n\nThe *Book of Laozi* elaborates in great detail on the infant practice, while the inner and outer chapters of the *Zhuangzi* explicate Heaven’s work and the sacred practice with great precision. The so-called sacred practice is the practice of entering sageliness—still yet luminous, quiescent yet radiant, vast and impartial. As things come, it responds in accord. Its practice leaves no tracks, its virtue harmonizes with Heaven and Earth. It exhausts nature to reach destiny, fathoms the spirit to penetrate transformation—from this arises the learning of inner sageliness and outer kingship.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is good, and so he is still. Rather, nothing in the ten thousand things can disturb his mind, and so he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and eyebrows, its levelness serves as a standard—even great craftsmen take it as their model. If still water is so clear, how much more the spirit! The mind of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking glass of the ten thousand things. That emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action are the level of Heaven and Earth and the ultimate of the Dao and virtue—thus the emperors, kings, and sages rest in them.\"* This shows that the sacred practice takes emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action as its fundamental principle.",
      "overlap_context": "this is where the sage conceals himself.\"\n\nThe above passages from *Zhuangzi* repeatedly expound the wondrousness of Heaven’s work. For the heart wanders in tranquility, qi merges with vastness, vast and empty as the Great Void, utterly without trace. Without moment or occasion, it transcends beyond the ten thousand existences, wondrously uniting with the image of the Lord before its manifestation. Still and luminous, quiescent and radiant, empty and natural—this is what is called Heaven’s work.",

      "translated_text": "Only through emptiness can one achieve penetration; only through stillness can one attain clarity; only through quiescence can one respond; only through blandness can one remain unstained—these are the essential principles of recovering one’s original nature and the standards for entering sagehood.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further states: *\"In going out and coming in, one does not perceive its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Non-Being. That Non-Being is the Non-Being of no Non-Being—it is where the sage abides.\"* This reveals the sage’s realm where both emptiness and existence are transcended, perfectly aligning with the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s state of *\"liberation from dharmas, where both are empty and nothing arises.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"One who takes Heaven as their teacher yet fails to truly follow Heaven perishes along with things—how can this be considered the mean? The sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with humanity, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things. They move with the world without decline, their actions complete yet unconfined—how could they be forced into conformity?\"* This means the sage precedes Heaven yet does not oppose it, not merely following Heaven’s timing afterward. Their mind transcends the state before Heaven and Earth arose, yet they still accord with sentient beings, walking and acting together, transforming and benefiting them with boundless compassion—far from the self-liberated Hīnayāna practitioners who enter the extinction of *nirodha-samāpatti* as their ultimate goal.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further declares: *\"The sage dwells like a nesting dove and eats like a fledgling bird, moving like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Dao, they flourish with all things; when the world loses the Dao, they cultivate virtue in seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, they depart as an immortal, riding white clouds to the celestial realm. The three calamities never reach them, and their body remains free from harm.\"* This shows the sage’s appearance and concealment are unfixed, their dwelling without constancy. They adapt to circumstances, neither resisting nor seeking, free from honor and disgrace. In adversity, they perfect themselves; in prosperity, they benefit the world. When the fruit of the Dao ripens, they transcend and depart—such is their freedom and ease. This is why the ancients abandoned worldly rank to cultivate celestial nobility.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"Those who do not strive for loftiness, who cultivate without relying on benevolence and righteousness, who govern without fame, who find leisure without retreating to rivers and seas, who attain longevity without guiding practices—nothing is not forgotten, yet nothing is not possessed. Serene and boundless, all excellence gathers to them. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\"* This reveals the sage’s wondrous forgetfulness and virtue of non-action, which those whose minds remain attached cannot hope to attain.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* further states: *\"Affirming this because of that, affirming that because of this—the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates with Heaven. Thus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance—this is called the sage’s conduct.\"* This means the sage does not cling to the duality of right and wrong but illuminates with wondrous clarity, forgetting both emotions and circumstances, transcending self and others. In responding to situations, whether so or not-so, they adapt freely, bestowing or withholding as needed, killing or enlivening at will. Thus, they employ right and wrong to quell others’ disputes, using poison to counteract poison, a wedge to remove a wedge—this is the great function of dissolving attachments and breaking bonds.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* also says: *\"Taking Heaven as their standard, virtue as their root, the Dao as their gate, and foreseeing transformations—this is called the sage.\"* Thus, the sage comprehends the virtue of Heaven and profoundly unites with the pivot of the Dao, abiding in its center to respond endlessly, their transformations unfathomable—all arising from their realization of the fundamental and illumination of the mind.\n\nIt further states: *\"When the mind is settled, the ten thousand things submit. Speaking of emptiness and stillness extending to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the ten thousand things—this is called celestial joy. Celestial joy is the sage’s mind nurturing the world.\"* This shows the sage’s governance of the world, taking emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action as their foundation, allowing each to return to their true mind and merge with the great transformation, free and unobstructed. This is what is meant by *\"governing through non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*’s *\"Chapter on the Sage’s Conduct\"* begins with upholding the precepts, abiding in the unshakable ground, then clarifies the Four Noble Truths of suffering, accumulation, cessation, and the path, cultivating precepts, concentration, and wisdom, ultimately revealing the eternal, blissful, true self, and purity. Progressing through the sage’s conduct taught in the *Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, one advances to the ground of fearlessness, attains the twenty-five samādhis, destroys the twenty-five realms of existence, and manifests various supernatural powers. Further, one abides in self-mastery, freely taking birth and accomplishing immeasurable, boundless merits.\n\nThe *Sūtra* further states: *\"Good son, what is called the sage’s conduct? It is the conduct practiced by the Buddha and bodhisattvas—hence it is called the sage’s conduct. Why are the Buddha and bodhisattvas called sages? Such beings possess all dharmas; they constantly contemplate the empty and quiescent nature of the sacred dharma—therefore they are called sages. They possess the sacred precepts—therefore they are called sages. They possess the sacred concentration and wisdom—therefore they are called sages. They possess the seven sacred treasures—faith, precepts, shame, remorse, learning, wisdom, and renunciation—therefore they are called sages. They possess the seven factors of enlightenment—therefore they are called sages. For these reasons, it is also called the sage’s conduct.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* expounds the *\"sage’s conduct,\"* while the *Liezi*’s *\"Confucius\"* chapter expounds *\"sage wisdom.\"* As the sage’s conduct is rooted in emptiness and stillness, attaining the six supernatural powers and the fourfold liberation, they achieve unobstructed perfection—thus sage wisdom manifests. This is truly the inner realization of the Daoist school, which, when compared with the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra*’s *\"self-realized sage wisdom,\"* is entirely congruent.\n\nThe above discussion of the celestial and sage’s conducts synthesizes the profound principles of the Daoist school and Buddhism. As for practice, it all converges in the single act of *\"mind and breath depending on each other,\"* which encompasses everything. Through one practice, all is practiced; through one realization, all is realized. Thus, if a practitioner truly attains the great concentration of true emptiness, both the celestial and sage’s conducts are fully contained therein.",

      "translated_text": "86. **Brahmacarya**\nBrahmacarya is the practice of purity (note: Ge Hong’s *Character Models and Teachings* defines *brahma* as pure conduct). The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* contains a chapter titled “Brahmacarya,” while the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* divides “Brahmacarya” and “Pure Conduct” into two separate chapters. “Pure Conduct” pertains to the Ten Faiths stage, and “Brahmacarya” to the Ten Abodes stage.\n\nHere, following the Daoist school’s doctrine:\nThe “purity and desirelessness” of the Daoist sages constitutes the essence of brahmacarya. “Desirelessness” means the absence of craving. When body and mind are pure, the six senses undisturbed, desire naturally ceases. Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* states: “The human spirit favors clarity, yet the mind disturbs it; the human mind favors stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the mind becomes still; when the mind is settled, the spirit becomes clear, and naturally the six desires do not arise, the three poisons dissolve. The reason one cannot achieve this is that the mind is not settled and desires are not dispelled. Those who can dispel them inwardly observe the mind, yet find no mind; outwardly observe the form, yet find no form; distantly observe things, yet find no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen; observing emptiness, even emptiness is empty—emptiness has no emptiness, and what is emptied has no existence; when even ‘no emptiness’ is gone, profound stillness remains. Stillness has no stillness, so how can desire arise? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness. Truly responding to things, truly attaining nature, constantly responding, constantly still—this is constant purity and stillness.”\n\nThe Daoist sages say: “Purity and stillness are the norm of the world.” They also say: “Constantly without desire, one may be called small; I am without desire, and the people naturally return to simplicity. The nameless simplicity will also be without desire; without desire and still, the world will right itself.” Thus, the Daoist sages not only dispel worldly desires but also relinquish attachment to all dharmas. Detached from both emptiness and existence, forgetting both the mundane and the sacred—is this not the ultimate brahmacarya?\n\n87. **Refining the Self and Laying the Foundation**\nThe initial stage of Daoist cultivation is called “refining the self and laying the foundation,” its meaning derived from the Laozi’s “empty the mind, fill the belly.” “Refining the self” is the first step in returning to emptiness. When the six senses are profoundly settled and the mind does not wander, the body and mind become utterly empty, thereby attracting primordial true yang. This nurtures one’s life-root, irrigates one’s spiritual root, and daily replenishes one’s true qi. The elixir furnace grows warm, its light penetrating the curtains—is this not the effect of refining the self and laying the foundation?\n\n“Refining the self” means emptying the mind; “laying the foundation” means filling the belly. The more empty and still the body and mind, the more abundant the arrival of true yang. This mutual resonance of emptiness and fullness, their interpenetration, is a subtle principle with swift effects. The Laozi states: “Carrying your *po* and embracing the One, can you never depart from it? Concentrating your qi to attain suppleness, can you be like a newborn babe?” This precisely describes this stage of practice.\n\nIn the end, it is nothing more than placing everything externally, mind and breath depending on each other. Once great concentration is attained, refining the self and laying the foundation are both accomplished therein. The late master often said: “Emptying the mind is cultivating concentration in the Palace of Departure; filling the belly is seeking the mystery in the Water Mansion. Emptying the mind and filling the belly—this is the dual cultivation of nature and life, refining the self and laying the foundation.” He also said: “When the mind is empty, the spirit settles; when the spirit settles, qi naturally returns. Thus, to fill the belly, one must first empty the mind. Mind and breath depending on each other, placing everything externally—this is how the mind is emptied.” He further cited Master Sanfeng’s *A Sprig of Flowers*:\n“I am a touchstone, revealing high and low at once;\nI am an iron steamed bun, hard to bite into;\nI am a sea of purity, unstained by a speck of dust;\nI am a luminous pearl, suspended in the void.”",

Thus, if a practitioner truly attains the great concentration of true emptiness, both the celestial and sage’s conducts are fully contained therein.",

      "translated_text": "He stated: “These four lines should serve as the standard for refining the self.” The work of laying the foundation begins with the softening of the entire body and continues until, in deep concentration, not even the slightest arousal of yang occurs; when qi is sufficient, the fire is withdrawn, and the foundation of the elixir is thus established. However, refining the self must proceed until the final return to emptiness before it becomes truly serviceable. From the initial return to emptiness to the final return to emptiness, all that lies between belongs to the work of refining the self. Hence it is said: “Laying the foundation has its limits, but refining the self is boundless.”\n\nI maintain that all delusions—whether coarse or subtle, from the *kleśas* of the senses to the *avidyā* of ignorance—must be thoroughly purged before one can claim the great accomplishment of refining the self. If even the slightest trace of subtle ignorance remains unsevered, the refinement of the self is still impure. The true crucible for refining the self is the great samādhi of true emptiness.\n\n**88. Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self (I)**\nThe self is the mind. Nurturing the self is preserving the mind and cultivating one’s nature; refining the self is disciplining the mind and tempering one’s nature. Though the work is the same, nurturing the self resembles planting flowers and tending trees, growing day by day, while refining the self is like forging gold with fire, becoming ever purer—their meanings are not without distinction.\n\nMaster Qianxu said: “Between nurturing and refining, one must still make distinctions.” Master Shangyang said: “Treasure essence and enrich qi—this is nurturing the self; facing circumstances without attachment—this is refining the self. Nurturing the self emphasizes stillness, while refining the self encompasses activity.”\n\nThus, to remain unstained by even a speck of dust, to empty all myriad thoughts, to abide in constant stillness while constantly responding, to dwell in activity yet remain ever tranquil—this is the work of refining the self. To be full of qi and whole in spirit, to restore and accumulate early—this is the effect of nurturing the self. If one unites and penetrates these, the work ultimately lies nowhere but in the interdependence of mind and breath. When this interdependence reaches great samādhi, nurturing the self resides here, and refining the self also resides here.\n\nSomeone asked: “Using samādhi to nurture the self aligns with the *Triple Concordance Canon*’s saying, ‘Internally to nurture the self, abide in tranquil emptiness’—its meaning is easily understood. But to say that samādhi refines the self seems contrary to Master Qianxu’s principle of refining the self as encompassing activity. Could you further elucidate this?”\n\nHe replied: “At the moment when spirit and breath are both settled, both inner and outer are empty. Because of this inner and outer emptiness and stillness, the primordial true yang is drawn to my body. The true qi steams and permeates the *ying* and *wei*, just as plants receive sweet dew, making my body and mind daily stronger—this is what is meant by nurturing the self. Yet though I am empty and still, when the primordial true yang arrives at my body, my entire being becomes soft and numb, undergoing various transformations of the *se*-skandha, while I remain unmoved and serene, as if unaware—responding yet still, like fire forging gold, the gold does not change color but grows ever more refined and luminous. Is this not refining the self?\n\nFurthermore, because of great samādhi, the *vijñāna*-spirit gradually submits, the original spirit gradually manifests, habitual tendencies gradually dissolve, and worldly toils gradually cease. What the ancients called ‘the heart dies and the spirit lives’—is this not the meaning of refining the self? Though Master Qianxu spoke of refining the self as encompassing activity, the essence of refining the self truly lies in activity without activity. For stillness reaches its extreme and gives rise to movement—this movement is the movement of qi. When qi moves, the spirit immediately awakens. If this awakening drifts outward, spirit and qi separate, and the primordial instantly transforms into the acquired. If the awakening does not drift outward but remains settled externally, spirit and qi do not separate, and they are sent back to the earthen cauldron to be firmly sealed. Thus, both nurturing and refining the self ultimately hinge on a single word: *samādhi*. Samādhi is the non-duality of stillness and response—the Dao of the elixir begins and ends with it. As the *Book of Changes* says: ‘That which begins the myriad things and ends the myriad things—nothing is more flourishing than *gèn*.’ *Gèn* is stillness and cessation of movement—this is samādhi.”\n\nSomeone asked: “Then do nurturing the self and refining the self have a sequence? Is there an intention that they mutually support one another?”\n\nHe replied: “Nurturing the self and refining the self indeed rely on each other. Though there is no inherent sequence, it is not incorrect to speak of one. Why? The essence of nurturing the self depends on the cultivation of primordial true yang, so that my original qi grows daily more abundant and my original spirit daily more flourishing. Yet for every portion of primordial true yang that enters, a portion of acquired yin qi is dissolved. As yin qi is dissolved, deluded thoughts and desires diminish accordingly. For these desires are entirely the mischief of yin qi. Thus, the more abundant the true yang, the purer the mind. The deeper the work progresses, the more habitual tendencies and discriminating views are transformed, the fewer deluded thoughts arise, until one faces circumstances with suchness, unstained by even a speck of dust, all myriad thoughts emptied—all this is caused by the primordial true yang dissolving the delusions of the mind. That refining the self draws upon nurturing the self is abundantly clear.\n\nMoreover, as delusions daily dissolve and monthly transform, the central earth of the self grows ever stiller, body and mind ever more tranquil, and the power of samādhi ever increases. The primordial true yang from without is increasingly drawn in, until qi is sufficient and the fire is withdrawn—the returning elixir is formed. That nurturing the self supports refining the self is also beyond doubt.”",

      "translated_text": "Thus, refining and nurturing mutually support one another. Though the ancients spoke of \"nurturing in stillness\" and \"refining in activity,\" this was framed in terms of the opposition between movement and quiescence. When movement and quiescence merge as one, stillness is ever-responsive, and responsiveness is ever-still—refining is nurturing, and the work proceeds as a single, unbroken practice. There is nothing to divide, nor any need to divide, hence the saying: \"It does not depart from the single word *quiescence*.\"\n\n**89. Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self (II)**\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir was called \"learning the undifferentiated\" in ancient times. The Old Sage spoke of \"guarding the center and embracing the One,\" while Zhuangzi simply said \"guarding the One and abiding in harmony.\" There was no mention of nurturing the self or refining the self. During the Western Han, Master Cui Xifan’s *Mirror for Entering the Medicine* comprised eighty-two verses in two hundred forty-six characters, encompassing the entire Dao of the Elixir without once referring to nurturing or refining the self.\n\nOne may ask: \"When, then, did such terms arise?\"\nThe answer: \"In the Eastern Han, Master Wei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: *'Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in tranquil emptiness. The root is hidden yet luminous, inwardly illuminating the body.'* This is the origin of the term *nurturing the self*. The term *refining the self* first appears in texts after the Tang and Song dynasties. The Pure Yang Realized One’s *Lyrics to the Melody ‘Spring in Qin Garden’* says: *'The sevenfold-returned elixir requires one first to refine the self and await the time.'* Master Sanfeng’s *Lyrics to the Melody ‘A Sprig of Flowers’* says: *'Moment by moment, rein in the horse of the mind; instant by instant, refine the monkey of the heart. Day and night without rest, the work of refining the self is unceasing.'* By the Ming dynasty, Master Qianxu’s *Rectifying the Golden Elixir* provided precise instructions on refining the self.\"\n\nI say: The Dao of the Elixir is fundamentally simple. For one who attains the samādhi of heart and breath interdependently harmonized, nurturing the self with true water and refining the self with true fire leaves nothing unaddressed. True water is the water of true emptiness of nature, the true emptiness of the water of nature. True fire is the fire of true emptiness of nature, the true emptiness of the fire of nature. When the work reaches true stillness and true emptiness, refining and nurturing are both subsumed, the wondrous aperture and mystery merge as one, and all is unified.\n\n**90. Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger**\nThe *Triplex Unity* states:\n*\"The crescent moon forms the furnace and crucible,\nthe White Tiger serves as the pivot of refinement.\nMercury, the sun, becomes flowing pearls,\nthe Green Dragon accompanies it.\nRaise the east to meet the west,\nand the hun and po naturally bind one another.\"*\nElsewhere it says:\n*\"The Dragon calls to the Tiger,\nthe Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.\nThe two consume one another,\nboth covetously merging.\"*\nThough the phrasing is plain, its implications run deep.\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"The White Tiger of the western mountains rages wildly,\nthe Green Dragon of the eastern sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and force them to fight to the death,\nand they transform into a lump of purple gold frost.\"*\n\nThe *Four Hundred Character Inscription on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The Dragon comes from the eastern sea,\nthe Tiger rises from the western mountains.\nThe two beasts battle fiercely,\ntransforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nAnother verse, *Song for Master Liu the Daoist*, says:\n*\"When the season arrives, employ the matchmaker.\nThe Metal Elder and the Maiden of Mercury wed.\nThe Metal Elder prefers to ride the White Tiger,\nthe Maiden of Mercury ever mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form.\nThe Tiger comes to rest in the autumn mountains,\nthe Dragon stirs from the azure depths.\nThe two beasts meet and battle fiercely,\nwaves surging and seething like a boiling cauldron.\nThe Yellow Dame and Ding the Elder lend their might,\nshaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.\nIn an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,\nand a mysterious pearl is planted in the mud below.\"*\n\nThe *Song of Stone Bridge* says:\n*\"I dwell within the mountains, truly boasting much,\nwhere flowers that never wither grow everywhere.\nNorth of the mountain, a cave conceals a fierce tiger,\nemerging to roar, wind and rosy clouds arise.\nSouth of the mountain, a deep pool hides a scaly dragon,\nascending in clouds, descending in rain, the mountain shrouded in mist.\nWhen the two beasts meet and battle,\nthe hidden pearl is the true omen of the mysterious.\"*\n\nMaster Ziyang vividly depicts the battle of Dragon and Tiger, evoking awe and dread. I once raised this with my teacher, Wang, who said: \"When heart and breath depend on one another, the Dragon is naturally subdued. What else remains unresolved? Do not cling to words or fixate on phrases.\"\n\nLu Qianxu remarked: \"It is only because of the phrase *'the two tigers fight'* that misguided and heterodox schools have proliferated.\" Thus, in his *Exegesis on the Four Hundred Characters*, he writes:\n*\"Kan-lead is hard to obtain yet easily devours people, hence symbolized by the Tiger. Li-mercury is prone to flight and difficult to control, hence symbolized by the Dragon. The Dragon comes from the eastern sea, coming to join the Tiger. The Tiger rises from the western mountains, rising to follow the Dragon. The elixir method drives the Dragon to join the Tiger, guides the Tiger to follow the Dragon, causing the two beasts to devour and consume one another, battling within the palace of wu and ji. When they merge and harmonize, they transform into the marrow of heaven and earth, and the returning elixir may be accomplished.\"*\n\nXuanjing said: \"Subduing the Dragon means restraining the mind’s incessant delusion. Thoughts arise ceaselessly, galloping without pause, emerging and vanishing unpredictably, their origin unknown—hence likened to a Dragon. Taming the Tiger means mastering the breath’s ingress and egress. The breath is as difficult to regulate and tame as a Tiger. Thus, subduing the Dragon is subduing the mind, and taming the Tiger is taming the qi. The wonder lies in the interdependence of heart and breath beyond the body. When the heart depends on the breath, it congeals; when the breath depends on the heart, it flows smoothly. Gradually they harmonize, growing ever finer and subtler, until they stand immovably still—thoughts arise and cease no more, the breath enters and exits no more. Then the efficacy of subduing the Dragon and taming the Tiger is manifest.\"\n\nThis is the foundational work of the Mysterious School. Furthermore, at the moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, when the primordial true qi arrives, the entire body feels a melting, tingling sensation. If one stirs even the slightest thought at this juncture, the primordial instantly reverts to the postnatal, causing harm rather than benefit.",

When the celestial nature unfolds in clarity and Dragon and Tiger leave no trace, this is the ultimate fruition of their subjugation.\n\n**Verse:**\n*(Adapted from the gāthās of Chan Master Puming and others, replacing \"ox\" and \"man\" with \"Dragon\" and \"Tiger,\" for the Chan metaphor of herding the ox shares the same purport as the Daoist subjugation of Dragon and Tiger.)*\n\nDragon and Tiger vanish without a trace,\nBright moon’s light embraces the ten thousand forms.\nShould you ask the true meaning therein—\nWildflowers and fragrant grasses grow in profusion.\n\nNo shadow of Dragon, no track of Tiger,\nWhy carve steps into the vast emptiness?\nIn the end, nothing whatsoever remains,\nYet the ten thousand forms naturally abound.\n\nSeeking their radiance in vain,\nNo Dragon, no Tiger—mist and water dissolve into space.\nAs the great earth awakens from spring’s dream,\nThe sun climbs high, incense scatters, flowers bloom in clusters.\n\nNo trace of Dragon or Tiger to be found,\nLike the pure moon pervading empty space.\nWhy inquire further into its meaning?\nBirds sing of themselves, flowers bloom of themselves.\n\nA life built on the tip of a snail’s horn,\nFrom the outset, they share a single home.\nHow laughable that ancients left this image—\nThirty feet of wisteria vine leave no room for delay.\n\n---\n\n**91. Refining and Withdrawing-Adding**\n\nWhat is meant by \"civil refinement and martial tempering\"? In a word, it is the state where spirit and qi harmoniously merge, and body and mind remain unmoving.\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* states: *\"Someone asked, ‘What is refining?’ I replied: ‘At the moment when body and mind are about to unite yet remain ununited, if even the slightest stray thought intrudes, confront it with resolute determination—this is martial tempering. After body and mind have united and spirit and qi have merged, guard it with a gentle, harmonious heart—this is civil refinement.’\"* There is no other principle here; simply subduing body and mind is the refining of Lead and Mercury.\n\nTo forget emotions and nurture nature, to empty the heart and cultivate spirit, to instantly still the myriad conditions and clarify the hundred thoughts—this is the foundation of the Elixir, likened to the Sacred Embryo.\n\nThe oral instruction says: The wondrous union of heart and breath in the Mysterious School, with a single intent of harmonious merging, is the work of refining. The state of being indistinct and vague, profound and obscure, chaotic and undifferentiated—this is the landscape of refinement. If distinguished in detail, then the interdependence of breath is martial tempering, while the absence of breath in samādhi is civil refinement.\n\nWhat is meant by \"withdrawing-adding\"? It refers to withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. The work lies solely in the word \"settling\"; when body and mind attain great samādhi, the Dao-embryo naturally rounds itself. No contrivance is needed—naturally, there is withdrawal without withdrawing, addition without adding. This is the wondrous function of non-action and non-effort.\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Treatise on Withdrawing-Adding* states: *\"Someone asked about the principle of withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. I replied: I heard from Master Liyang that after obtaining the Medicine and returning it to the cauldron, one nurtures it with the natural true Fire, continuously and subtly present. Within this, the transformations of withdrawing and adding arise spontaneously, without allowing the slightest use of intellect or force. For the Dao is non-action, yet spirit and qi naturally act in accord with the wondrous workings of creation. It is like cooking rice—one and the same principle. When Lead is added to Mercury, it is like water being poured into rice. The water must not be excessive, nor the rice too scant—just as the two eights correspond. With even fire, the water gradually dries while the rice gradually swells, becoming cooked rice. The drying of the water is called withdrawing Lead; the swelling of the rice is called adding Mercury. Withdrawing is not internal reduction—spirit enters qi as heaven’s qi moves within earth, its mechanism concealed. Adding is not external overflow—qi envelops spirit as earth’s qi receives heaven, gradually nurturing growth. Thus, the embryo rounds and spirit transforms, giving rise to a body beyond the body. The wondrousness of creation reaches this point, all occurring naturally, without knowing how or why. If one seeks to understand the how and why of withdrawing and adding, it is no longer natural.\"*\n\nThe *Verse Commentary on the Golden Elixir’s Verification* further states: *\"Yet one must also know that when Lead and Mercury combine to form the Elixir, it is like salt dissolving in water, like glue blending with color. How can one then distinguish which is Lead, which is Mercury, or what can be withdrawn or added? Ah! The Returned Elixir is also emptiness—at this point, idle chatter is in vain.\"*\n\nLi Daochun’s *Zhonghe Collection* states: *\"Someone asked, ‘What is withdrawing-adding?’ I replied: ‘The body unmoving and qi settled is called withdrawing; spirit settled and heart unmoving is called adding. Body and mind unmoving, spirit congealed and qi bound—this is called returning to the origin. Thus, extracting the yang from Kan to replenish the yin in Li and form Qian is called withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury.’\"*",

Then the efficacy of subduing the Dragon and taming the Tiger is manifest.\"\n\nThis is the foundational work of the Mysterious School. Furthermore, at the moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, when the primordial true qi arrives, the entire body feels a melting, tingling sensation. If one stirs even the slightest thought at this juncture, the primordial instantly reverts to the postnatal, causing harm rather than benefit.",

      "translated_text": "Xuanjing said: *\"When body and mind are unmoving, this is the Great Fixation. Spirit and qi conjoin in stillness, merging into a single crucible. With long-continued quiescent illumination, qi is wholly transformed into spirit, and the numinous radiance shines alone—all phenomena dissolve and fuse. Is this not the sign of the perfected embryo? The Patriarch Lu likened it to cooked rice, a most apt comparison. The essential point of Elixir-making lies in the Great Fixation: when body and mind are quiescent and unmoving, Lead and Mercury return to True Earth. Steaming and refining, withdrawing and adding, bathing and gentle nurturing, shedding the embryo and spiritual transformation—all are contained within it. Thus it is said to be most simple and most easy.\"*\n\n**Ninety-Two: Extracting Kan to Fill Li**\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Extract the solid center from the Kan position,\nTransmute the yin within the Li palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian—\nWhether hidden or soaring, all depends on the heart.\"*\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious* states:\n*\"Extract the Elixir from within Kan,\nA golden blossom reveals a single stem.\nAuspicious clouds unfold across the heavens,\nPropitious light fills the gates of death.\"*\n\nThe Mysterious Tradition borrows the images of the *Yijing* to illustrate the Dao of the Elixir. The true yang within Kan is originally Qian’s former property; only after falling into the posterior heaven does Qian break to become Li, and this one yang sink into the Kan position. Now, employing the method of return, one extracts the solid from Kan to fill the hollow in Li, thereby restoring the Qian trigram and reverting from old age to youth. When the practitioner’s cultivation reaches the point of utter emptiness and profound stillness, the whole body softens and numbs—this is precisely the moment when the three yang of Kan enter. Nurturing it with the Great Fixation, gradually gathering and congealing, one proceeds until the Elixir forms, and the work of extracting Kan to fill Li is complete. The crucial point is to recognize the one move beyond the body’s empty space, for then extraction has its locus.\n\nThis image of extracting Kan to fill Li traces its origin to Nüwa’s smelting stones to mend the heavens. Even in Zhuangzi’s *Free and Easy Wandering*, the passage *\"The roc charts its course southward\"* subtly reveals this image. The *Free and Easy Wandering* states:\n*\"In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so vast that no one knows how many thousands of miles it spans. When it rises in flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. The *Qi Xie* records strange matters. It says: When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, the water churns for three thousand miles. It mounts upon the whirlwind and ascends ninety thousand miles, departing on the sixth-month gale.\"*\n\nThis passage arrives as if cleaving the void, sweeping across with unbridled force.",

      "translated_text": "Those who do not understand dismiss it as mere absurdity; to those who have grasped the secret, it is immediately clear as the work of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li.\" Let me briefly interpret its imagery:\n\nThe fish in the Northern Darkness symbolizes the true yang within Kan, for Kan resides in the north. Its transformation into a bird signifies the moment when qi stirs with the season. \"Rising in flight\" denotes the upward surge of qi. \"Its wings like clouds hanging from the sky\" describes the billowing ascent, white qi filling the void—just as Lü Zu said, \"White clouds ascend to the upper gate,\" and as Master Zi Yang put it, \"At first, it is like clouds filling a thousand mountains.\" The Southern Darkness represents Li in the south. Zhuangzi’s pairing of north and south mirrors the opposition of Li and Kan. This bird’s migration from north to south—is this not the movement of *wu* flowing to *ji*, the very process of \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\"?\n\nZhuangzi’s analogy of Kun and Peng refers precisely to the true yang qi. This primordial qi is vast and unyielding, so immense that none can measure its thousands of miles. When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, \"the water churns for three thousand miles\"—these three thousand miles signify the three yang of Qian. \"Mounting the whirlwind to ascend ninety thousand miles\" refers to the nine of Qian. In the alchemical practice of \"fierce fire refinement\" (where heart and breath interdepend externally), the image of nine is employed; in \"gentle fire nurturance\" (where breath ceases in samadhi), the image of six is used. Movement corresponds to Qian, stillness to Kun. The true yang within Kan is originally Qian’s own essence, hence the three thousand and ninety thousand both align with Qian’s imagery.\n\nAs the true yang ascends, the bellows are stirred to aid its progress, lest it stall midway. Fire blazes with wind, surging through the three barriers to pierce the crown of the head—this is the subtlety of employing nine. The following line, \"departing on the sixth-month gale,\" refers to the six lines of Kun. Kun embodies stillness. Here, at the gate of Kun’s return, stillness reaches its extreme and gives rise to movement. Receiving this true yang qi of Qian, refined with gentle fire, the Elixir of Return is formed, replenishing primordial yang to restore the Qian state—this is called \"rejuvenation.\" Nine is the number of yang, yet within it, the six yin symbols are already implicit.\n\nThis passage is profoundly esoteric; for two thousand years, no one has fully expounded its meaning—truly, discerning truth is difficult. Liu Xin classified the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi as Daoist, while categorizing the esoteric scriptures of immortals under \"miscellaneous arts,\" revealing his failure to grasp the source of the Dao. Is the cultivation of immortals not the Dao? Did Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, and Guan Yin not succeed in Daoist practice and become immortals? The principles of alchemical classics do not exceed those of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Guan Yin, and their peers; they merely employ symbolic language, making comprehension elusive.\n\nThe *Baopuzi* claimed, \"Laozi’s discussions are too broad and vague, while Zhuangzi, Wenzi, Guan Yin, and their followers, though following the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, never reached the ultimate teachings, remaining a thousand *li* from the path of immortality.\" Alas! Such a statement betrays a lack of reflection. In this collection, the profound meanings of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, Guan Yin, and others are fully revealed and exhaustively expounded. If Ge Hong were to see this, one wonders what his reaction would be!\n\n---\n\n**93. Jade Refinement and Gold Refinement**\nThe Mystic School speaks of \"jade liquid refining the form\" and \"gold liquid refining the form,\" later termed *jade refinement* and *gold refinement*. Jade is prized for its warmth and luster; where jade lies hidden in the mountains, grasses and trees never wither. The human body is the same—when true qi is abundant, the skin glows, the complexion brightens, and one’s spirit becomes robust and flourishing. The *Cantong Qi* states, \"The yellow center gradually permeates reason, its moisture reaching the skin\"—this is the effect of jade refinement.\n\nGold is valued for its indestructibility, like the unbreakable vajra. After attaining the Great Return Elixir through cultivation, one transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood, the Dharma body enduring eternally, unharmed through kalpas. Hence, the term *gold refinement*, and the Elixir is called the *Golden Elixir*. Traditionally, practitioners often regard inner nurturance—serene and non-action—as *jade refinement*, while the refinement of the Great Return Elixir, the transformation of the spirit and shedding of the mortal form, is called *gold refinement*. The distinction between the Lesser and Great Returns is thus framed as *jade* and *gold refinement*, yet the practice fundamentally revolves around the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nWhen one reaches the state of great samadhi, internally, the seven returns occur, the lead cauldron warming gently. Externally, the nine returns manifest, the primordial unity of qi responding to every stimulus, merging with body and mind into a single furnace, forged into one. This is the simultaneous nurturance of inner and outer, the unity of heaven and humanity—golden resonance and jade vibration, all pervaded by one principle.\n\n---\n\n**94. Subduing Qi and Ingesting Qi**\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Subdue qi without ingesting it; ingest qi only after subduing it.\nIngesting qi does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing qi.\"*\n\nTo subdue qi is to guide qi with spirit, heart and breath interdependent, transforming ordinary breath into true breath—the wondrous mystery of the primordial natural Dao, the true essence of the unity of nature and life. Ingesting qi is a method of post-heaven intention, akin to what moderns call \"breathing fresh air\"—exhaling the old and inhaling the new, like Western deep breathing or China’s ancient practices of \"preserving spirit and swallowing qi.\" Unaware of the crucial step of transcending the void outside the body, one cannot attain the marvel of true breathlessness, relying instead on post-heaven respiration to draw in air. Such practices of exhalation, inhalation, and guiding qi merely bring comfort and longevity.\n\nSubduing qi, however, severs external respiration, returning breath to the origin. Body and mind settle into stillness, the true void within sensing the wondrous existence beyond. Wondrous existence and true void merge seamlessly, forged into one, coalescing into the Dao embryo. Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood—its power is immense.",

      "translated_text": "Purple Clarity Elder said: \"Refining the elixir with fire to form the cinnabar is precisely guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao.\" This is the teaching of subduing qi. Subduing qi begins with regulating breath.\n\nXu Jingsun said: \"Internally harmonizing true qi while preserving breath, naturally the transformations of creation restore youthful countenance.\" Cao Wenyu said: \"Concentrating qi to achieve softness, spirit lingers long; the coming and going of true breath flows effortlessly.\" Lü Zu said: \"Cease striving at the alchemical furnace and river chariot; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath extend endlessly.\" Longmeizi said: \"Breathing yin and yang should be silent; regulating inhalation and exhalation must be continuous.\" All these speak to the essence of regulating breath. When breath is regulated to stillness, the work of subduing qi manifests.\n\n**95. Ordinary Breath and True Breath**\nOrdinary breath is the inhalation and exhalation through our mouth and nose. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. Exhalation expands and belongs to yang; inhalation contracts and belongs to yin. This breath through the mouth and nose begins when we leave the womb, hence it is called ordinary breath. All ordinary people, day and night, never depart from this breath.\n\nThe alchemical school employs the method of mind and breath interdependent, uniting mind with breath. Spirit and qi merge, gradually harmonizing and refining until they seem to exist yet not exist. At this time, the eighty-four thousand pores open, true qi steams and permeates, blending into blissful ease—soft, tranquil, and indescribable. As Zhang Jinghe’s *Tai Xi Jue* says: \"Like fish in a spring pond, like hibernating insects. Vast qi fuses, numinous winds stir. Neither turbid nor clear, neither mouth nor nose. No going, no coming, no exiting, no entering.\" This is the true realm.\n\nWhen ordinary breath ceases, true breath naturally appears. Once true breath appears, true qi naturally arises, yang fire advances, and yin tally retreats. Thus it is said: the breath that does not breathe is called true breath.\n\n**96. Mysterious Breath and Embryonic Breath**\nThe *Da Dong Jing* states: \"Stabilize harmony, wondrous clarity, and mysterious breath ensures longevity.\" Mysterious breath is true breath, also called embryonic breath, spirit breath, or tortoise breath. When spirit and qi embrace, the mind holds no thoughts, with no going or coming, external breath ceases, and the embryo congeals—hence it is also called embryonic breath, resembling the breath of an infant in the womb.\n\nMaster Ma said: \"The cavernous void is pure and still; mysterious breath flows unimpeded, without obstruction, inner and outer both clear.\" He also said: \"Let not the thunderous void startle you; receiving the register, golden blossoms yield jade essence. Nurturing clarity to return to the Great Beginning, continuous mysterious breath ensures longevity.\"\n\nThe term \"mysterious\" means that one’s breath aligns with the breath of the void and the breath of heaven and earth. Thus one can seize the creative power of heaven and earth, congealing the numinous elixir in an instant. If external breath does not cease, it cannot be called mysterious. This embryonic breath is the precursor to the return in the Mysterious School. One must grasp the crucial step of the void beyond the body, entering qi with spirit, gradually regulating and harmonizing, refining and subtling, until breath naturally stills, the body merges with the void, and one dissolves into samādhi—only then does one enter the wondrous realm of mysterious breath.\n\n**97. Responding to Stars and Responding to Tides**\nMaster Cui’s *Ru Yao Jing* speaks of \"heaven responding to stars, earth responding to tides.\" Commentators have expounded much on principle but revealed little of the secret. From my observation, it precisely illustrates the image of mind and breath interdependent.\n\nHow so? Heaven responding to stars refers to the fire within *li*, a single point of spirit-light—our own numinous awareness. Reflecting inward and congealing into the qi cavity, like starlight shining downward, the *kan* water receives the steaming of the *li* sun, naturally transforming into ascending qi, like the tide flowing upstream. This is the wondrous function of the five phases inverted: fire, which flames upward, is made to descend; water, which flows downward, is made to ascend. Thus *kan* and *li* merge, and water and fire assume the image of completion.\n\nThe secret says: When mind and breath externally align, heart-fire does not flame upward but shines downward. Once heart-light shines downward, kidney-water naturally transforms into ascending qi and no longer rushes downward. When postnatal yin and yang merge, body and mind settle into stillness, naturally achieving the arising of yang in quiescence. When the time arrives, the wondrous principle manifests: the single yang within *kan* surges upward, the true fluid within *li* descends, metal and water merge, the four images unite, and the work of seven returns is accomplished.\n\nThus, when mind and breath externally align, *kan* and *li* internally merge. Responding to stars and tides is like an echo answering a call—its marvel is beyond conception.\n\n**98. Profound Obscurity and Primal Obscurity**\n*Laozi* said: \"Profound, obscure—within it lies essence.\" *Zhuangzi* said: \"The essence of the supreme Dao is profoundly obscure.\" Lü Zu said: \"How to recognize the profoundly profound Dao? The Dao lies in profound obscurity—examine it closely.\" He also said: \"Profoundly obscure, obscurely profound, born of vagueness; vaguely, hazily, it coalesces into a mass.\" Li Daochun said: \"Vast qi congeals spirit in profound obscurity, emerging from existence and entering non-existence in vagueness.\"\n\nAn ancient immortal said: \"True lead is not produced within the five metals; it is born in profound obscurity before heaven and earth.\" Ning Xuanzhi said: \"Not in worldly toil, not in mountains—seek directly the source of profound obscurity.\" Chaoyuanzi said: \"The enlightened ruler governs, myriad states clear; a single stream of the Yellow River connects to profound obscurity.\" He also said: \"Profoundly, obscurely, primally harmonious—white and clear. Three return to the homeland; the heir apparent returns to the eastern sea.\"",
      "overlap_context": ", relying instead on post-heaven respiration to draw in air. Such practices of exhalation, inhalation, and guiding qi merely bring comfort and longevity.\n\nSubduing qi, however, severs external respiration, returning breath to the origin. Body and mind settle into stillness, the true void within sensing the wondrous existence beyond. Wondrous existence and true void merge seamlessly, forged into one, coalescing into the Dao embryo. Transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood—its power is immense.",

      "translated_text": "Cangmingzi said: \"Within the vague and obscure, there is an image—only then does one know the utmost mystery of creation.\" He also said: \"Water and fire ascend and descend into the Yellow Court; the union of true essence congeals in profound obscurity.\" Chen Xiyi said: \"When profound obscurity just reveals a trace, the vague and hazy still do not distinguish self from other.\" Master Sanfeng said: \"Within profound obscurity, there is trust; in vagueness, there is no seeing or hearing.\" Wang Yangming said: \"Leisurely observing the forms of things, all teem with life; in stillness, one awakens to heaven’s mechanism and enters profound obscurity.\"\n\nSuch verses and gathas are too numerous to cite in full. In sum, *yaoming* (\"profound obscurity\") is where spirit and qi merge in darkness, entering a state like drunkenness yet not drunkenness—this is the sign of embryonic breathing. Only when spirit and qi unite can one summon primordial true yang. Then, within stillness, movement arises, and true essence is born. Thus, to gather the primordial, one must deeply enter profound obscurity, attain utmost emptiness and profound stillness, and respond to every stimulus—naturally, the medicine takes form with an image.\n\n*Zhuangzi* said: \"Exhaust life and fulfill emotion, and heaven and earth rejoice while all affairs vanish. All things return to their nature—this is called *hunming* ('chaotic obscurity').\" Lu Fanghu said: \"Life is what heaven bestows; emotion is what nature emits. Exhaust life and fulfill emotion, and the center is attained, harmony is also attained. Thus, above and below flow as one with heaven and earth, and the burdens of things are entirely dissolved. Hence it is said: 'Heaven and earth rejoice while all affairs vanish.' 'All things return to their nature'—this is called *hunming*: restraining one’s nature and returning to it. When emotion is fully expressed, all expressions are harmonious. Returning to nature means being utterly still and motionless, returning to the center. Returning to the center, one is dim and silent, equal to the primordial chaos. Hence it is said: 'This is called *hunming*.' The art of chaos is nothing but this cultivation.\"\n\nXuanjing said: *Hunming* is merging with profound obscurity, the very image of chaos, directly entering the great samadhi of true concentration, blending with the Dharma-realm’s great unity. This is what *Laozi* meant by \"returning to the limitless.\"\n\nThus, from the initial concentration of profound obscurity, one transitions into the great concentration of *hunming*, where the burdens of things are entirely dissolved, and cultivated nature returns to virtue.\n\n---\n\nLaozi said: \"The Dao models itself on spontaneity.\" The *Cantong Qi* said: \"What spontaneity does is no false or deceptive Dao.\" It also said: \"Yang abides in harmony, and nature and emotion are spontaneous.\" Lü Zu said: \"Cease thoughts, forget schemes, and merge with spontaneity.\" The *Zhao Lun* said: \"Serene and profoundly silent, one wondrously accords with spontaneity.\" The *Xinxin Ming* said: \"Observing all dharmas equally, all return to spontaneity.\" It also said: \"Grasping it, one loses measure and must enter deviant paths. Releasing it to spontaneity, the body has no coming or going.\"\n\nCangmingzi said: \"The great Dao is empty and void, following spontaneity. Beyond spontaneity, there is no mystery. Be supple and focus qi like an infant—hungry, seek food; tired, sleep.\" The *Yinfu Jing* said: \"The Dao of spontaneity is still, thus heaven, earth, and the myriad things are born.\" It also said: \"Therefore, the sage knows the Dao of spontaneity cannot be violated and thus regulates it accordingly.\" This is the evidence that both Chan and Daoism value spontaneity.\n\nLaozi also said: \"What cannot be seen is called *yi* ('subtle'); what cannot be heard is called *xi* ('rare'); what cannot be grasped is called *wei* ('minute'). These three cannot be further questioned, so they merge into one.\" He also said: \"Chaotic, as if turbid.\" Dongshan said: \"Chaotic, with nothing to hide—what more is there to seek?\" Caoshan said: \"Chaotic, without inside or outside, harmonious and level above and below.\" He also said: \"Chaotic, concealing principle and phenomena—its signs are utterly obscure. Before the King of Awesome Sound awakened, how could Maitreya be alert?\" This is further evidence that both Chan and Daoism value chaos.\n\nWhat, then, is the ultimate difference?\n\nIt is answered: Returning to the limitless, chaotic and without trace. Principle and phenomena both vanish; merit and rank both conceal—this is called *hunran* (\"chaotic\"). *Hunran* is the image of chaos. *Ziran* (\"spontaneity\") is acting without effort, still and serene—like a bright mirror reflecting images, an empty valley echoing sounds, each following its capacity without imposing the self. This is the wondrous function of the true Dao.\n\nThe excellence of *hunran* is the virtue of chaotic completion—this is the wondrous essence of the Dao. In terms of practice: when mind and breath interdepend to utmost purity, the mind naturally follows the breath, and the breath naturally follows the mind, without allowing the self to arise in intention or arrangement. Even all firing times must not be controlled by the self. When the tally naturally accords, this is the primordial realm, the verification of wondrously merging with spontaneity.\n\nAs practice deepens, even this wondrous state of spontaneity is forgotten. Chaotic and undifferentiated, unknowing and unaware—even if yang arises, the mind remains utterly still and unmoved, no different from unawareness. At this stage, wondrousness is exhausted and merit is forgotten, returning to simplicity. Profoundly still, the physical body gradually reverts to childlike purity. The Gate of Yang closes, the consciousness-nature gradually transforms, and all unwholesome habits are smelted away. Body and mind both assume the image of childlike purity. This chaotic true realm is the secret key to returning to childhood and the mysterious mechanism of restoring life.\n\nThe *Goulou Bearing the Cicada*, *Boatman Steering the Boat*, *Carpenter Making a Saw*, *Gongchui Turning the Lathe* in Zhuangzi’s *Attaining Life*, and the *Butcher Ding Carving the Ox* in the *Nourishing Life* chapter all illustrate the firing times of spontaneity. As for Ji Sheng’s raising the fighting cock to become a wooden cock—this precisely illustrates the firing times of chaos.",

      "translated_text": "100. **Softness and Numbness**\nThrough the interdependence of heart and breath, long and pure refinement is achieved. The spirit settles with the breath, and the breath transforms with the spirit. At this stage, breathing shifts from the mouth and nose to the pores—opening and closing in harmony with heaven and earth, empty and natural. The true yang of heaven and earth then permeates the four limbs and hundred bones, penetrating the five viscera and six bowels, bringing a sensation of melting softness and bliss. As the practice deepens, the softness intensifies, from the crown to the soles, permeating both inside and out. When softness reaches its extreme, it turns into numbness. This numbness manifests in three distinct forms: first, numbness during the interdependence of heart and breath; second, numbness in the state of dim indistinctness; and third, numbness within profound stillness. To attain numbness in stillness is precisely the moment of circulating the *Small Celestial Cycle*. These subtle transformations of firing times are unrecorded in the myriad volumes of alchemical texts, transmitted only through a master’s oral instruction.\n\n---\n\n101. **Before and After Gui**\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"When lead encounters gui’s arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon’s decline, it is no longer fit to taste.\"* This clarifies gathering before gui. Zhang Sanfeng’s *Xuan Yao Pian* says: *\"The Supreme Dao, proclaimed again, reveals the secret of pre-heaven and post-heaven. It speaks only of lead arising after gui, not of yang arising before gui.\"* It further states: *\"When the lead flower appears at gui’s end, the Western Garden’s branches bloom once more.\"* And: *\"Lead arises after gui, yin and yang divide—just as the first crescent of metal and water fills, like orioles and flowers in spring’s second month.\"* This clarifies gathering after gui. The *Lesser Yang* and *Wenshi* schools diverge in their alchemical formulas—how can they be reconciled?\n\nMaster Xuanjing replied: I once heard from Master Wang that lead is yang, and gui is yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises; when stillness reaches its limit, movement returns. Thus, it is said that lead arises only after gui. Yet the birth of true yang is swift as lightning, unable to linger in the pre-heavenly state. In an instant, it generates gui-water, turning yang into yin. Hence, it is said: *\"When lead encounters gui’s arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\"* To gather swiftly at gui’s arising is precisely to act urgently before gui-water emerges. Thus, the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"It cannot be used when seen; when used, it cannot be seen. In dim indistinctness, they meet; in profound obscurity, transformation occurs. In a flash, the flame soars, and the true person naturally appears.\"* Zhang Sanfeng’s *Xuan Yao Pian* also says: *\"Seek the true seed where lightning flashes; trace the root source when the wind’s signal arrives.\"* Thus, whether before or after gui, the true mechanism of gathering holds subtle meanings within. When harmonized, the principle remains unified—they are not in conflict.\n\n---\n\n102. **Yang Fire and Yin Talisman**\nAlchemists speak of advancing yang fire and retreating yin talisman, abbreviated as advancing fire and retreating talisman, also called talisman-fire. Master Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Gather in due time, discerning floating and sinking; advance fire cautiously to avoid peril.\"* And: *\"When the first yang arises in renewal, advance fire without delay.\"* Longmeizi’s *Jindan Yinzheng Shi* says: *\"At the hour of zi, advance fire; at gui, conceal it—this is the morning’s fire-advancing chapter. Respond to yin and yang in silence; regulate breath’s ebb and flow with continuity.\"* And: *\"At the hour of zi, eighteen stars appear—this is the talisman-retreating fire cycle. As tamed ice begins with *Gou*, stored treasures fill *Kun*.\"* Master Qianxu said: *\"Fire is the fire of spirit. Advancing fire nurtures yang; retreating talisman nurtures yin.\"* The *Preface to the Four Hundred Characters* states: *\"Refined with yang fire, it transforms into yang qi; nourished with yin talisman, it transforms into yin essence.\"* The Dao of heaven and earth uses yang to generate and yin to complete. Thus, warmth, heat, cold, and coolness each follow their fixed order, and the myriad things thereby undergo generation, growth, harvest, and storage. The Dao of the golden elixir is no different.\n\nI once posed this question to Master Wang, who replied: *\"These are all metaphorical expressions, like fish traps and rabbit snares. The alchemical method simply involves the interdependence of heart and breath, until external breathing becomes faint, and the entire body melts into soft bliss. When primordial true yang arrives upon you, irrigating and steaming, advancing one part yang naturally retreats one part yin—just as advancing one part light retreats one part darkness. All occurs naturally, leaving no room for the slightest contrivance. This is what Ziyang meant when he said: ‘The great elixir’s method is utterly simple and easy. Its explanation is concise and precise, beyond further elaboration. Even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, will immediately ascend to the realm of sages.’ If one relies on hexagrams, lines, and times to determine advancement and retreat, how could the dull and ignorant endure it?\"*\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Canto on the Measurement of the Cantong Qi* states: *\"Someone asked about advancing fire and retreating talisman. I replied: Fire is the fire of spirit—I already know this. But what is the yin talisman? Does it have any explanation? I heard from my immortal teacher regarding the seven returns and nine refinements: Seven is the number of fire, nine the number of metal. Refining metal with fire to form the elixir is like guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao. From this perspective, the wondrous work of elixir-making begins and ends with a single fire. When advancing, it is fire; when retreating, it is talisman. Talisman means union—speaking of ascent and descent, advance and retreat, inner and outer in harmony. When circulating fire, spirit and qi embrace, holding to the One without separation, continuous as if present. It is but a single fire—where is there room for a yin talisman to be used?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, in alignment with the hexagrams *Gou* (䷫), *Dun* (䷠), *Bo* (䷖), *Kun* (䷁), *Pi* (䷋), and *Guan* (䷓), we speak of \"submission,\" \"departure from position,\" \"destruction and harm,\" \"loss and disappearance,\" and \"return to the origin\"—all referring to yin in retreat. Just as after the full moon, yin gradually wanes, its light naturally diminishing, fading bit by bit until it reaches darkness, only to revive again as the new moon, this speaks of yang in advance, not of yin. If we were to speak of yin, we should instead speak of *advancing* talismans.\n\nFrom this perspective, within our own bodies, where is there room for a yin talisman to be used?\n\nFurthermore, the *Discourse on Fire Talismans* states:\n\"Someone asked about the similarities and differences between the advance and retreat of fire talismans, the morning *Tun* (䷂) and evening *Meng* (䷃). I replied: In the past, before receiving my teacher’s guidance, I privately considered the timing of fire difficult to discern. I once measured it against the celestial cycle, aligned it with hexagram qi, divided it by watches and clepsydra—all to no avail. Only later did I suddenly awaken, realizing that the ten thousand volumes of elixir classics and the six hundred fire records could all be discarded in an instant. The so-called true fire has no fixed timing, and the great medicine has no fixed weight—this was no deception.\"\n\nI say: Indeed, as Master Wang has stated, when a single measure of primordial true yang advances, yin qi naturally retreats in equal measure, as if matching tally sticks. This is one explanation.\n\nWhen heart and breath depend on each other, this is *advancing fire*, governing refinement. When this dependence deepens into samadhi and both spirit and breath are forgotten, this is *retreating talisman*, governing nurturance—just as the Perfected One of Hidden Emptiness said. This is another explanation. Movement is yang, stillness is yin; movement governs advance, stillness governs retreat.\n\n**103. Igniting and Extinguishing Fire**\nIn elixir methods, igniting fire means heart and breath depending on each other, while extinguishing fire means forgetting both spirit and breath, entering samadhi in perfect tranquility. This is the common oral instruction.\n\nMy late teacher transmitted three secret methods for extinguishing fire:\n1. **Extinguishing fire during essence refinement.** Without this method, one often becomes attached to the body, risking seminal emission. Whenever yang arises and the external yang stirs, leading to ejaculation, it is always due to ignorance of how to extinguish fire.\n2. **Extinguishing fire during qi refinement.** Without this method, one often risks qi leakage, called \"losing the elixir,\" rendering all prior efforts futile. Even the ancient Perfected One Bai Yuchan was not spared this calamity, as seen in his poem: *\"I must re-rig my fishing rod, / And cut anew the autumn bamboo.\"* How much more so for others? Without knowing the initial method for extinguishing fire, the yang pass cannot be sealed, and the foundation of the elixir cannot be completed. Without knowing the second stage’s method, even with sufficient qi, one cannot form the elixir; after forming it, one cannot nurture it; and after the elixir matures to circulate the great celestial cycle, one cannot *\"reinstall the furnace, reestablish the tripod, / Ride the tiger and mount the dragon to transcend the mortal realm.\"*\n3. **Extinguishing fire during spirit refinement.** Without this method, samadhi cannot be perfected, the light of the heart cannot become whole, and one risks the peril of leakage, inevitably regressing to a lesser attainment. The ancient teaching of the three leakages (perception, emotion, and speech) and the principle of manifesting dignified conduct without departing from quiescent samadhi are both essential for verifying the completeness of nature and spirit in samadhi. This stage of extinguishing fire is most critical and most profound. Without it, one cannot refine nature to its subtlety or act without obstruction.\n\nFor four years, I studied under Master Wang. He often spoke of the initial method for extinguishing fire during essence refinement, never concealing it. However, the oral instructions for the latter two stages were only revealed during my final audience in the fourth year. After four years of diligent effort, I obtained them with difficulty and dare not record them carelessly. I treasure and guard them in secret. Scholars need only know that the Western Lineage’s transmission indeed includes three methods for extinguishing fire, ensuring safety, perfection, and transcendence.\n\nFor beginners, when yang first arises, desire is easily stirred, leading to seminal emission. At this moment, a clear teacher must impart the essential method to extinguish the postnatal ministerial fire, so that body and mind remain unmoved and the peril of leakage is avoided. Yet in recent times, many blind teachers do not even know how to remedy the ailment of yang arising and seminal emission, let alone understand the initial method for extinguishing fire during essence refinement. How could they possibly grasp the deeper, secret methods of the second and third stages, which lead to the boundless, freely self-existent state of *\"shattering empty space\"*?\n\nThe leakage of qi during the second stage of qi refinement is called \"losing the elixir.\" In the indistinct, profound state, yang qi surges like wildfire, escaping through the *weilu* (tailbone), impossible to restrain—akin to seminal emission during essence refinement (though one leaks from the front, the other from the rear. After extinguishing fire, the yang pass is sealed, the front path blocked, and leakage occurs through the anus). Bai Yuchan’s *Poem on Failing to Refine the Elixir* says:\n*\"I gathered it into my jade gourd,\nGuarding it closely, daring not to leak.\nAt midnight, thunder and wind suddenly arose,\nSmoke and vapor filled the vast emptiness.\nSuch a state and flavor—\nA mute biting his tongue.\nClutching my belly, I can only laugh,\nLest my heart grow vexed and hot.\nI must re-rig my fishing rod,\nAnd cut anew the autumn bamboo.\"*\n\nThis is the true circumstance of qi leakage. It arises from ignorance of how to extinguish fire, suffering this great calamity. If one leaks again upon re-refining and reaching qi sufficiency, progress in cultivation becomes impossible. Thus, the method for extinguishing fire at this stage is profoundly secret.\n\nSomeone asked: What fire is extinguished in the final stage?\nI answered: The fire of ignorance. If the subtlest ignorance is not purified, nature cannot become whole. Only when ignorance is entirely dissolved and cleansed can one attain the wisdom of leakage’s end and thorough penetration. Having verified the absence of leakage, one transcends both the worldly and supraworldly, attaining unobstructed freedom.",
      "overlap_context": "lixir is like guiding qi with spirit to attain the Dao. From this perspective, the wondrous work of elixir-making begins and ends with a single fire. When advancing, it is fire; when retreating, it is talisman. Talisman means union—speaking of ascent and descent, advance and retreat, inner and outer in harmony. When circulating fire, spirit and qi embrace, holding to the One without separation, continuous as if present. It is but a single fire—where is there room for a yin talisman to be used?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Otherwise, one may attain only the five supernatural powers but not the sixth, which is the secret essential of completing the Dao through final return to emptiness.\n\nThis transmission traces from Ancestor Lü to Ancestor Li, from Ancestor Li to the Perfected One of Western Garden, from the Perfected One to Master Wang, and thence to me. Between these four transmissions, less than a century has passed—truly what Master Qianxu called “the fortune of three lifetimes, the rare encounter of a thousand years.”\n\n**Section 104: The Geng Month and the Full Moon**\n\nThe *Geng* month refers to the moon of the third day. The full moon refers to the moon of the fifteenth day.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: “On the third day it emerges bright, as *zhen* receives *geng* from the west.” The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “When the moon is but a half-wheel bright at the edge of the sky, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl are already heard.” Ancestor Lü instructed Master Qianxu: “When snow mirrors the cold pool and the new moon hangs on the plum branch, only then may the medicine arise.” The Perfected One Qianxu’s *Ode to the Dao De Jing* states: “The young maiden first opens the northern flower; look up to see the *geng* moon, a slanted hook.” All these clarify the meaning of the *geng* month.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: “On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—precisely when the golden essence is at its peak.” Master Shi Xinglin says: “When the wind first stirs in myriad hollows and the moon suddenly rounds over a thousand mountains, swiftly issue the command to circulate the *zhou tian*.” Chen Cuixu says: “On a moonlit night, gazing within, one may gather and conjoin celestial soul and terrestrial soul to form the numinous elixir.” Zhang Sanfeng says: “The moon’s fullness depends on the oral instruction; the marvel of the midnight hour lies in heart transmission.” He also says: “When the moon is full, the jade bud blooms.” All these illustrate the meaning of the full moon.\n\nWhat path should one take?\n\nI answer: The two ancestors, Qianxu and Hanxu, have already clarified this. Qianxu’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Someone asked, ‘You speak of the fifteenth day of the eighth month and also of the third day when *geng* emerges—what is the meaning?’ I replied, ‘The fifteenth symbolizes the sufficiency of the metal-water *qi*; the third symbolizes the freshness of the metal-water medicine. If *qi* is insufficient, water will not arise. When considered together, the meaning becomes clear.’”\n\nAncestor Hanxu says: “The newly appearing yang light is the evening of the third day. The fullness of metal-water is the night of the fifteenth. When alchemists speak of the third day and also of the fifteenth, the third symbolizes the freshness of the metal-water *qi*, while the fifteenth symbolizes its sufficiency. If *qi* is insufficient, water will not arise. The third and fifteenth must be regarded as one moment, envisioned as one continuous thread—one must not calculate by counting numbers.”\n\nThe oral instruction states: When the scholar’s practice reaches great samadhi, forgetting form and image, abiding in emptiness and stillness, then the primordial *qi* will arise abundantly, like the full moon—this is what is meant by “when the source is clear, the *qi* is surely sufficient.” Within samadhi, at the first awakening of yang, when it aligns with the natural rhythm and turns outward in dependence, without stirring a single thought, then the yang *qi* is pure and fresh, not old but tender, like the moon of the third day. Thus, the *geng* month and the full moon point to the flourishing of the medicine and the freshness of the sprout—their meaning is consistent, not contradictory.\n\nWhen samadhi is sufficient, *qi* flourishes; when departure from the body is swift, the medicine is fresh. In this way, send it back to the earthen crucible and re-enter great samadhi. Then the *zhou tian* practice will be without error, the gathering and nurturing will be proper, and the verification of the returned elixir will be visible in days—is this not the essential key to restoration?\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Someone asked, ‘Why is tender medicine usable?’ I replied, ‘In the *qi* of creation, what has accomplished its work retreats, and what is to come advances. It is like brewing wine: the three-day ferment, though floating and slight, can transform a thousand jars. At this time, the flavor may be faint, yet the vital impulse is vigorous. If it has already ripened into wine, it cannot be used again.’”",

The Toad and the Hare’s Spirit**\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*\"On the third day, clarity emerges,\nZhen receives Geng from the west.\nOn the eighth, Dui receives Ding,\nThe first quarter hangs straight as a cord.\nBy the fifteenth, Qian’s body is complete,\nFullness abounds in Jia’s eastern realm.\nThe toad and the hare’s spirit,\nSun and moon’s *qi* shine as one.\nThe toad gazes at the hexagram’s node,\nThe hare spits forth radiant light.\"*\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* employs the two images of the toad and the hare’s spirit as most wondrous. Master Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* follows this, saying:\n*\"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow—\nPrecisely when metal’s essence is robust and flourishing.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"If you ask what true lead is,\nThe toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River.\"*\n\nMaster Xu Shenweng says:\n*\"Resplendent, the golden flower of sun and moon’s essence,\nFlowing, the jade liquid of heaven and earth’s marrow.\nDeep in the night, the sky’s expanse is free of dust,\nOnly the toad’s light illumines the divine water.\"*\n\nAn ancient worthy’s poem reads:\n*\"On the Western River’s bank, raise your gaze—\nA tide of toad-light dips into emerald waves.\nNow is the time to refine the two eights with care,\nDiligently entrusting it to the Yellow Dame.\"*\n\nAll trace their origin to the *Cantong Qi*’s image of the toad.\n\nMaster Qianxu the Perfected’s *Ceshu* states:\n*\"Those who speak of the moon today use many names—\nSome call it the toad, others the hare’s spirit.\nYet the toad and the hare’s spirit must be distinguished:\nThe toad is the moon’s essence, while the hare’s spirit is the moon’s body.\nNow, the moon’s light is borrowed from the sun,\nThus the *qi* of sun and moon must face each other to generate brightness—\nThis is the natural principle of yin and yang’s gestation.\nYet yang arises gradually:\nThe toad’s birth depends on the hexagram’s node.\nAs yang beneath the hexagram grows, the toad’s essence gradually forms,\nAnd only then does the hare spit it forth to generate light.\"*\n\nMaster Xuanjing says: The toad symbolizes the *qi* of primordial true yang. When the practitioner’s work reaches great samadhi, Qian and Kun naturally unite. Stillness gives rise to movement, and when true yang arrives, the toad’s light appears. Swiftly direct it outward with a single touch, maintaining unmoving mindfulness. Thus true yang will not escape, and you may send it back to the earthen crucible for secure sealing. The toad lurking at the water’s bottom symbolizes metal within water. The hare’s spirit, illuminated by the sun’s light, symbolizes the medicine’s production after the union of spirit and *qi*.\n\n**106. Divine Water and the Flowery Pond**\nMaster Yuchan’s *Danfa Cantong* states:\n*\"The heart’s source, the ocean of nature, is called the Flowery Pond.\nNature is like water—it is called divine water.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme alchemy of the highest vehicle. Master Ziyang’s *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* says:\n*\"The Flowery Pond’s lotus blooms,\nDivine water’s golden waves are still.\nDeep in the night, the moon is bright—\nHeaven and earth become a single mirror.\"*\n\nThese four lines offer vivid metaphors that resonate with Master Yuchan’s words.\n*\"The Flowery Pond’s lotus blooms\"* describes the blossoming of the heart’s flower, the revelation of nature’s light. Master Yuxi says:\n*\"Split open the Great Ultimate’s bud,\nRevealing the heart of heaven and earth.\nThe void’s expanse knows no bounds—\nA sliver of moon appears above the solitary peak.\"*\nThis is the meaning of the flower’s bloom.\n\n*\"Divine water’s golden waves are still\"* describes the ocean of nature’s waves calmed, the winds of circumstance stilled, the waves of consciousness unarisen—profoundly settled and at rest.\n\n*\"Deep in the night, the moon is bright\"* and the following line illustrate the principle of pure clarity and luminous reflection, where all phenomena merge in emptiness. *Zhuangzi* says: *\"When the great vessel is settled, radiance issues from celestial light.\"* The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:\n*\"When numinous light enters brilliance, the ten thousand spirits arise together.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The black pearl reveals its true form,\nWithin and without, all is luminously clear.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The source’s purity shines with light,\nIts cultivation bears fruit.\nIn quiescence and wondrous awareness,\nMysterious breath naturally grants long life.\"*\nThis is its meaning.\n\nSome take the mouth as the Flowery Pond and saliva as divine water—this is the alchemy of the lower grade. Others take the union of *qi* and spirit as the Flowery Pond and the entry of spirit into *qi* as divine water—this is the alchemy of the middle grade. But Master Yuchan’s teaching transcends form, body, spirit, and *qi*, thus belonging to the most supreme vehicle. Nature and heaven unfold in clarity, perfectly round and purely wondrous, utterly beyond the reach of thought—deeply accordant with the ancient sages’ principle of *\"the constant virtue knows no deviation.\"*\n\n**107. Heaven’s Root and the Moon’s Grotto**\nThe Song Confucian Shao Yaofu’s poem reads:\n*\"Eyes and ears keen, a man’s body—\nThe great potter’s gift is no poverty.\nOnly by exploring the moon’s grotto do you know things,\nWithout gathering heaven’s root, how can you know man?\nWhen Qian meets Xun, observe the moon’s grotto;\nWhen earth meets thunder, see heaven’s root.\nRoaming between heaven’s root and the moon’s grotto,\nAll thirty-six palaces are spring.\"*\n\nThis poem, *\"Chant on Observing Things,\"* subtly contains the alchemical transformations of the Daoist school. For the alternation of firing times does not depart from movement and stillness. Within movement there is stillness, within stillness there is movement. When movement and stillness unite, quiescence and responsiveness never part—only then is its wonder fully realized.\n\nThus Kun is earth, stillness. Zhen is thunder, movement. When earth meets thunder, it forms the hexagram *Fu*—this is called *Heaven’s Root*, precisely the moment of utter emptiness and profound stillness when one yang returns. That primordial *qi* emerges from the formless, and when the time arrives, the spirit knows.

      "translated_text": "Understanding the meaning of *Heaven’s Root* and *the Moon’s Grotto*, one’s gathering, nurturing, bathing, sealing, and securing will all align with the proper measure. As *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"Once Fu and Gou are mastered in application, who can say the golden elixir will not succeed?\"* Generally, the marvel of creation lies in the reversal of yin and yang—*Heaven’s Root* initiates at the fore, while *the Moon’s Grotto* observes completion thereafter. This is what is meant by *\"what continues it is goodness; what completes it is nature.\"* *\"Thirty-six palaces all abloom with spring\"* precisely illustrates the fire-timing without error, the harmony of yin and yang, where every corner of the heart brims with spring. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *\"Primordial qi, postnatal qi—who attains it remains ever as if intoxicated.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Life and Returning to Nature**\n\nThe ancient sage said: *\"Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life; returning to life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"Use the heart to return to the heart.\"* Returning the heart is returning to nature. This teaching of returning to life and returning to nature is the profound subtlety of the Daoist school’s cultivation of nature and reversal of virtue, the wondrous path of thorough realization of the true and constant.\n\nThe study of returning to life requires returning the self to emptiness and quiescence, for only emptiness can respond. The practitioner, through the interdependence of heart and breath, directly enters the state of great samadhi. When samadhi endures and stillness prevails, this is called returning to the root. Returning to the root means moving from activity back to stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme, it reverts to movement—primordial *qi* responds to resonance, and I respond to it with movement. Externally, heart and breath interdepend; spirit and *qi* unite as one, abiding in samadhi without reckless dispersion. This is *\"seeking the mysterious in the water palace, stirring the wind of Xun to move the fire of Kun.\"* Then, through the interdependence of heart and breath, gradually shift from martial fire to civil fire. When spirit and breath both forget, one enters great samadhi again. Thus, the prior and posterior heavens each find their place; inner and outer harmonize; body and mind become serene and joyful. The true *yi*’s *qi* obtained is then sent to the earthen crucible for secure sealing—only then may one conclude a single cycle of practice.\n\nTherefore, the study of returning to life must undergo three reversals: from movement to stillness, from extreme stillness back to movement, and from movement again to stillness. Master Wang once told me: *\"One samadhi before yang arises, one samadhi after yang arises. The former samadhi awaits the birth of the medicine and the resonance of true yang; the latter samadhi serves for bathing, nurturing, sealing, and secure concealment.\"* The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence*’s *\"three reversals day and night\"* likely refers to this stage of work. This is the esoteric mystery of the Daoist school’s return to life, which must pass through *\"three reversals\"* to accomplish the task.\n\nReturning to nature is the Daoist school’s principle of *\"dawn’s clarity revealing the solitary.\"* As Master Ziyang said: *\"There is nothing that is not my heart; there is nothing that is my self.\"* He also said: *\"Shatter the empty void to see the whole body.\"* Li Daochun said: *\"Shatter the empty void to attain great awakening.\"* And again: *\"Lift it clearly to reveal the whole body, then must break through the pivot of primordial unity.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"Round and luminous, this one point no thousand sages have transmitted.\"* Master Miaozheng said: *\"The great radiant mirror shines brilliantly; all things and I are reflected within. The wondrous body ever abides in stillness, its light illuminating the six gates.\"* In such vast clarity of spirit, essence and function are thusness itself. Transcending this upward path, one attains what is called *\"great rest\"* and *\"great freedom.\"* Abiding in the ever-quiescent light, one may walk arm in arm with all buddhas and tathagatas—this may be called the full fruition of bodhi.\n\n---\n\n**Action and Non-Action**\n\nMaster Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"At first, those who act are rarely seen; only when non-action is reached do the multitudes recognize it. Yet seeing non-action as essential, who knows that action is the foundation?\"* Here, action and non-action are presented together. Master Qianxu’s *Profound Insight into the Dao De Jing* says: *\"All action is illusion; non-action is also illusion, yet not a trivial one. Dismissing both action and non-action still leaves illusion—only when clouds disperse does the moon shine clear in the empty sky.\"* How, then, to reconcile them?\n\nIt is said: When heart and breath interdepend within external emptiness, one neither clings to action nor falls into void. It is both action and non-action, neither action nor non-action—only then does one accord with the Dao’s wonder and manifest its wondrous function. Thus, Master Qianxu also composed a verse: *\"Originally there was neither being nor non-being; do not vainly seek non-being in the great void. Recognize the true wondrous function of spontaneity—ten thousand rivers’ bright moons are but a single solitary wheel.\"* Reading this verse, one knows the Daoist school’s purport lies elsewhere.\n\nSomeone may ask: *\"The *Diamond Sutra* says: ‘All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows.’ Does not the Daoist practice of refining essence, refining *qi*, refining spirit fall into action? If it is action, it remains but a dream. If it is non-action, why speak of refining?\"*\n\nThe answer: *\"You know only action and non-action, but not acting without attachment. Acting without attachment means moving all day yet never having moved—what concern is there for action? The *Diamond Sutra* is no different: it speaks of emptiness throughout, without clinging to form, yet does not fall into annihilation. The sutra’s saying ‘give rise to the heart without abiding anywhere’—is this not the meaning of spirit and *qi* uniting in emptiness? Again, in the ‘Sequence’ chapter, it describes ‘putting on robes, holding the alms bowl, going and returning for alms, washing the feet, arranging the seat.’ Upon seeing this, Subhuti praises: ‘Rare, World-Honored One!’ Now, what is the purport of the ‘Sequence’ chapter, and whence comes Subhuti’s praise? If you do not fault the World-Honored One for putting on robes, holding the alms bowl, washing feet, and arranging the seat, why fault the Daoist for refining essence, refining *qi*, refining spirit? The ancient immortals said: ‘The elixir is refined within non-refinement; the Dao is practiced within non-practice.’\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Datong Sutra* states: \"Attaining quiescence, one does not move; attaining harmony, one does not shift.\" Master Hanxu’s *Concise Explication* says: \"Quiescence without movement is samādhi; harmony without shifting is peace.\" As for the profound teaching, only when the heart and breath harmonize and merge do the body and mind attain dual quiescence, becoming utterly still. The more quiescent the body and mind, the more harmonious the qi, until external breath ceases entirely, and one abides in great samādhi. Within samādhi, the prior and posterior heavens naturally unite, entering true quiescence. Only then does \"supreme harmony overflow, and bones scatter like cold jade.\"\n\nThe Old Sage said: \"Quiescence is lord over restlessness,\" and \"Though there be glory to behold, one dwells in serenity, transcendent.\" He also said: \"To know harmony is to know constancy.\" Quiescence and harmony—these are the great principles of the profound teaching, the model for sagely cultivation.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Great Master\" chapter states: \"The Dao has sentiment and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It may be transmitted but not received, attained yet not seen.\" The Old Sage said: \"Dark and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.\"\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: The Dao is true emptiness. True emptiness is not empty, thus it manifests wondrous being. Sentiment and trustworthiness are the signs of wondrous being. What is sentiment? It is movement arising from extreme quiescence, resonance through response—what is called \"the return of the yang.\" When the prior-heaven qi arrives, the time comes and the spirit knows. The arrival of qi is the living *zi* hour; the knowing of the spirit is the living *wu* hour. Metal returns to essence—this response to that stimulus accords with the natural tally. Departing from the physical body, when the heart and breath depend on each other externally, the work of gathering is achieved.\n\nMaster Qianxu’s *Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence Sutra* says: \"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. The sage, compelled, names it the Dao. It is without form, without action—yet why does it have sentiment and trustworthiness? Laozi said: 'Vague and indistinct, within it there is something; dim and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.' These few lines are the secret treasury of discourse on the Dao through the ages. Zhuangzi’s learning derives from Laozi, and he directly speaks of sentiment and trustworthiness. What are sentiment and trustworthiness? They are spoken from the perspective of observing its subtleties through desire. Essence is the movement of quiescence; trustworthiness is the tally of movement. The word 'trustworthiness' is especially secret. A thousand sages and ten thousand perfected ones share this single key. Only with a teacher’s transmission can one realize it. Thus it is said to be transmissible, yet not receivable—meaning it cannot be seen.\"\n\nIn my view, what Laozi calls \"essence\" is what Zhuangzi calls \"sentiment.\" The *Awakening to Reality* says: \"In vagueness they meet, in obscurity there is transformation; in a flash, a flame flies, and the true person naturally appears.\" The *Essentials of the Profound* says: \"Seek the true seed where lightning flashes (this is essence, sentiment); when the tally of the wind arrives (this is the sign of trustworthiness), find the original source.\" These few lines suffice.\n\n---\n\nThe purport of prior-heaven and posterior-heaven is explained in two layers.\n\nFirst, as mutual opposition. For example, the emptiness outside the body is prior-heaven, while all within the physical body is posterior-heaven. Again, original essence and original qi are formless substances, called prior-heaven; the essence of intercourse and the qi of respiration, having fallen into form, are called posterior-heaven. Thus, through mutual opposition, the purport of prior and posterior heaven is elucidated.\n\nSecond, as progressive depth, the unfolding of practice. For instance, if harmonizing heart and breath is prior-heaven, then the usual state without practice is posterior-heaven. From harmonizing heart and breath, one enters vagueness and obscurity—then vagueness and obscurity become prior-heaven, while harmonizing heart and breath becomes posterior-heaven. Advancing further from vagueness and obscurity to great samādhi, where breath has no exhalation or inhalation, the heart no arising or ceasing, inner and outer are forgotten, and roots and dust are extinguished—then great samādhi becomes prior-heaven, while vagueness and obscurity become posterior-heaven. From great samādhi, one reaches complete emptiness and non-arising, emptying not only body, mind, roots, and dust, but even the form of samādhi itself. Space is pulverized, and the measure of the dharma-realm vanishes—then the pulverization of space becomes prior-heaven, while great samādhi becomes posterior-heaven. With each advance, it is like ascending a nine-tiered terrace. Progressing from lower to higher learning depends entirely on the practitioner’s effort in cultivation.\n\n---\n\nMaster Zhang Sanfeng said: \"Before encountering a true person, the scholar should be cautious and humble, accumulating merit and virtue. Do not retreat when facing demons, do not resent when slandered. Upon meeting a true person, seek earnestly and persistently, breaking through the two true messages within and without the body, so as not to be deluded by others.\"\n\nHe also said: \"If the practitioner knows the two true messages within and without the body, clearly and without obstruction, then proceed to nurture and refine, eliminating self-interest and restoring heavenly principle. The work of returning the elixir becomes most simple and easy—daily gathering the yellow sprouts outside the body to await the prior-heaven’s jade nectar. This is truly the wondrous realization of 'drinking wine and wearing flowers' to attain immortality.\"\n\nLet us now discuss this: The emptiness outside the body, in the Dao, is the beginning of the nameless heaven and earth; in the *Book of Changes*, it is Fu Xi’s prior-heaven trigrams, with *qian* to the south and *kun* to the north. The *kan* and *li* within the body are the images of King Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams.",

      "translated_text": "To practice the work of returning and restoration, one must begin with the emptiness outside the body, forgetting form and exhausting thoughts—only then can one \"precede Heaven without opposing it.\" If one seeks only within the physical form, one can merely \"follow Heaven’s timing in the posterior realm.\" Thus, *qian* and *kun* must serve as the host, while *kan* and *li* as the guest; the Dharma-body as the host, and the physical form as the guest. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states, \"Though others take the lead, I remain the guest.\" This distinction between inner and outer, host and guest, and the boundaries of prior and posterior Heaven must be thoroughly understood and firmly believed without doubt—only then can the work of returning and restoration proceed. When the great function manifests, one will not be misled by the physical form. *Journey to the West* illustrates this with Zhu Bajie, who symbolizes the human body: all demonic obstacles arise because Tang Sanzang mistakenly trusts his words and suffers greatly—this warns of the harm in clinging to the physical form. The *Compendium of Divine Immortals* records how the Dark Warrior ascended from beneath the Abandoned-Body Cliff, truly demonstrating the effect of transcending the physical form. \"Abandoning the body\" means that as practice deepens and true emptiness in great samadhi is attained, body and mind remain unmoved—whether the physical form is cut by blades, scorched by fire, sawed apart, or experiences pleasure, numbness, softness, or tremors, one remains steadfast externally, utterly unmoved, neither attending to nor clinging to it. As the *Yongjia Zhengdao Ge* states: \"Even if an iron wheel spins atop the head, perfect clarity in samadhi and wisdom remains unlost.\" Zhang Xujing said: \"Let it be, pay it no mind, leave it alone—it is what it is (all referring to the physical form), and what can it do to me?\" Only when one truly departs from the physical form, without the slightest attachment, does one enter the true prior Heaven. If Tang Sanzang had heeded Sun Wukong’s words at every step and ignored Zhu Bajie’s, no demonic trials would have arisen, and the Western Paradise would have been reached effortlessly. Thus, Tan Zixiao’s *Huashu* states: \"Forget form to nurture *qi*, forget *qi* to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness—when emptiness and reality interpenetrate, great harmony is achieved.\" Xue Daoguang said: \"If one empties this illusory body, one directly receives the true teachings of the sacred master.\" The alchemical classics state: \"Disregard the body, and the body is cultivated; forget the form, and the form endures.\" All point to the emptiness outside the body as the most essential secret of the elixir method. The \"two true messages within and without the body\" are precisely this. Among ancient and modern alchemical texts, none elucidates the emptiness outside the body more subtly than *Journey to the West*. Sun Wukong styles himself \"Grandfather Sun of the Outside.\" Observe how Tang Sanzang encounters demonic trials the moment he parts from Wukong. Whenever Wukong departs, he draws a circle ○ on the ground, instructing Tang Sanzang and the others to remain within—stepping outside invites danger. This circle is Wukong’s mark, and to ensure readers grasp its meaning, he repeatedly demonstrates it in person, clarifying that the Dao of the elixir must operate in the emptiness outside from beginning to end, without the slightest intention or attachment to the body. The precautions in the elixir path against danger and peril are precisely to guard against the inability to abandon the body and to caution against the failure to forget form. If one forgets form and abandons the body at every step, entering natural emptiness like the Dark Warrior ascending from beneath the Abandoned-Body Cliff, what danger could remain? Moreover, whenever Wukong battles, he first addresses the demons: \"Do you know Grandfather Sun of the Outside?\" Yet these demons, obsessed with eating Tang Sanzang’s flesh to prolong life for ten thousand years (mocking those who cling to the physical form in their practice—opening passes, circulating *qi* and blood, and seeking immortality through posterior Heaven’s ascent and descent), fail to recognize him. Only the Nine-Headed Lion, after a moment’s reflection, smiles and says: \"So it is *him*. My great-grandson, you’ve provoked *him*.\" Repeating the word *him* twice, he grasps the emptiness outside the body—hence he is called the Ancestral Master (the Lion). \"Lion\" and \"Ancestral Master,\" \"Grandfather Sun of the Outside\" and \"external work\"—all are homophones, signifying that a true master must teach one to begin with the emptiness outside the body, enabling the return to the original source and union with the great Dao of the mysterious principle.\n\n---\n\n**Inner and Outer Medicines**\nThe *Wuzhen Pian*’s *Xijiang Yue* states:\n*\"The inner medicine resembles the outer,\nInner and outer must both communicate.\nThe elixir-head unites in like kind,\nWith two nurturing functions in harmony.\nWithin lies the natural true fire,\nThe furnace glows red with enduring flame.\nThe outer furnace’s waxing and waning demand diligent work—\nNothing surpasses the true seed in marvel.\"*\n\nThis is the origin of the names \"inner\" and \"outer\" medicines. Commentators have proposed various interpretations, leaving students increasingly bewildered. Here, I briefly expound their meaning: The inner medicine and inner communication pertain to the seventh return. Within the physical body, the solitary yang revives—this is the union of *kan* and *li*, dragon and tiger. It arises when body and mind are both still, and one senses the true yang *qi* from without, giving rise to the winter solstice’s yang birth—feeling the yang *qi* surging upward (*kan*’s true yang ascending, gold within water) and the heart’s fluids descending (*li*’s true yin descending, water within fire). The four images of water, fire, metal, and wood converge; the five phases gather; the three families (body, mind, and intent) meet—this is rightly called the inner medicine. The outer medicine and outer communication occur at the moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, when the prior-Heaven’s singular *qi* emerges from the formless, and my true emptiness resonates with its wondrous being. The alchemical classics call this the union of *qian* and *kun* at the zi-wu axis—this pertains to the ninth return.",
      "overlap_context": "ow sprouts outside the body to await the prior-heaven’s jade nectar. This is truly the wondrous realization of 'drinking wine and wearing flowers' to attain immortality.\"\n\nLet us now discuss this: The emptiness outside the body, in the Dao, is the beginning of the nameless heaven and earth; in the *Book of Changes*, it is Fu Xi’s prior-heaven trigrams, with *qian* to the south and *kun* to the north. The *kan* and *li* within the body are the images of King Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams.",

      "translated_text": "Within the physical form, the spontaneous workings of non-action are called the principle of nature. Thus it is said: *\"Within, there is the celestial true fire, blazing crimson in the furnace.\"* This furnace refers to the inner furnace. As for the outer realm of emptiness, when mind and breath interdepend, one shifts from gentle fire to fierce fire, and from fierce fire back to gentle fire, advancing and retreating without missing the proper time, moving and stilling without disrupting the sequence—only then does the omen of *\"yellow skirts, primal auspice\"* appear. In this process, the slightest deviation in the firing times leads to a vast divergence. Hence it is said: *\"The outer furnace’s adjustments demand diligent effort.\"* This is the spontaneous workings of action and effort, called the cultivation of life. It is the profound mechanism of wondrous being.\n\nThe true seed refers to the singular *qi* of prior Heaven. The ancestral *qi* of prior Heaven gives rise to the myriad transformations, much like the seed of a plant. When alchemists obtain the singular *qi* of prior Heaven and congeal the elixir, this analogy is but a figurative expression. The practice is nothing other than the interdependence of mind and breath. Upon reaching the state of true emptiness and great samadhi, the inner and outer medicines both circulate. Externally, the nine returns occur, and the singular *qi* of prior Heaven arrives spontaneously; internally, the seven reversions take place, and the five phases and four images naturally converge. The three families meet of themselves, water and fire naturally achieve harmony, and all signs of efficacy arise unbidden, arriving unsought—possessing the marvel of water flowing to form a channel.\n\nThus *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *\"Only with utmost sincerity does the Dao follow naturally.\"* *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: *\"What is done by nature cannot be a devious path.\"* The oral instruction declares: The inner medicine circulates through the spontaneous workings of non-action and non-effort, produced by the union of *kan* and *li* (within the body as *kan* and *li*); the outer medicine circulates through the spontaneous workings of action and effort, born from the union of *qian* and *kun* (outside the body as *qian* and *kun*). The marvel of the alchemical method lies in non-action and non-effort, uniting with the wondrous being of true emptiness—this is the wondrous Dao of inner and outer harmony.\n\n---\n\n**Wu Earth and Ji Earth**\n\nSomeone asked: Alchemists speak of *wu* earth and *ji* earth. Refining *wu* earth yields the lead of the *kan* moon; refining *ji* earth yields the mercury of the *li* sun. When *wu* and *ji* unite to form the *daogui*, the four images of *kan*, *li*, dragon, and tiger intermingle and congeal the elixir. Yet this is spoken in terms of principle—how, in actual practice, are *wu* earth and *ji* earth distinguished? I beg you to clarify.\n\nThe answer: I once heard from Master Wang that the most essential aspect of the alchemical Dao is attaining the one touch of true emptiness. When one truly reaches the state of great samadhi and true emptiness, *wu* and *ji* earths naturally harmonize without need for arrangement. If we distinguish them, then: when verifying inner emptiness, one obtains *ji* earth—central emptiness and stillness, with not a thought arising, not an intention stirring, the five phases and four images converging of themselves. This is called the inner medicine, the seven reversions. When verifying outer emptiness, one obtains *wu* earth—the singular *qi* of prior Heaven arrives spontaneously. This is called the outer medicine, the nine returns. The singular *qi* of prior Heaven is termed the true seed. A seed must find true earth to sprout; the alchemical Dao is the same. Only when true emptiness manifests in the present moment does one possess this true earth, enabling the reception of the externally arriving true seed, thereby achieving the marvel of returning to the womb and re-creating *qian* and *kun*.\n\nThese *wu* and *ji* earths are the inner and outer mysterious passes, the inner and outer furnaces and cauldrons, the inner and outer matchmakers, accomplishing the work of the seven reversions and nine returns. *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The inner medicine is the same as the outer medicine; when the inner circulates, the outer must also circulate.\"* Know that upon reaching true emptiness, the inner and outer medicines both circulate, and the inner and outer earths naturally unite. Inner and outer merge indistinguishably, form and spirit fuse mysteriously—all alchemical methods spontaneously attain completion. Thus it is called the wondrous Dao of utmost simplicity and ease.\n\nI have often said that to grasp the ancient immortals’ alchemical methods, one need only contemplate the name and symbolic forms of Ancestor Lü. Ancestor Lü’s name is *Yan*, his courtesy name *Dongbin*, his Daoist name *Chunyang*; he called himself *Huiweng* and also *Wushan Daoren* or *Wukou Xiansheng*. Combining the characters *Lü* and *Yan* yields \"five mouths, one mountain.\" *Chunyang* refers to the prior-Heaven Dharmakaya; *Dongbin* refers to the posterior-Heaven physical form. It speaks of the four great elements as a temporary aggregation, a guest within the emptiness of the hollow, while the pure *qian* of emptiness is the true host. As *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"Though he acts as host, I remain the guest.\"* When practice reaches the state of great samadhi, inner and outer are both empty—thus inner and outer merge mysteriously, physical form and Dharmakaya interpenetrate and intertwine, neither one nor two, forming the symbol of the circle. This is why Ancestor Lü called himself *Huiweng*.\n\nThe three-character oral instruction says: *\"Mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture.\"* This directly points to inner and outer both being empty—the symbolic form of the character *Lü*. When inner and outer unite as one, *wu* and *ji* merge, presenting the circular form of the character *hui*. In the *Yijing*, *gen* symbolizes the mountain, and the mountain means cessation. When body and mind are utterly still and unmoving, reaching great samadhi, then east three, south two, north one, and west four intermingle within the palace of *wu* and *ji*—this is the esoteric meaning of \"five mouths, one mountain.\" The symbolic form of *Yan* signifies body, mind, and intent standing unmoving like a mountain—this is the ultimate state of great samadhi.\n\n*The Pointers to the Nature and Life* states: *\"Gathering the three to return to the one lies in emptiness and stillness. Emptying the heart unites spirit with nature; stilling the body quiets essence and emotion; when intent reaches great samadhi, the three origins merge as one. Emotion uniting with nature is called metal and wood in harmony; essence uniting with spirit is called water and fire in communion; intent in great samadhi is called the five phases complete. Yet essence transforming into *qi* arises from the body’s immobility; *qi* transforming into spirit arises from the heart’s immobility...\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"Spirit transforming into emptiness arises from the intent’s immobility.\"\n\nThis passage explains that the great samadhi of body, heart, and intent forms the foundation of the Three Transformations in the Mysterious School, perfectly aligning with the symbolic form of *Yan* and faithfully preserving the orthodox transmission of Patriarch Qiu. Thus, the ancestral elixir formulas of the former masters regard the true emptiness of great samadhi as the paramount essential. Without attaining this state, neither inner nor outer medicine can circulate; neither the earth of *wu* (戊) nor the earth of *ji* (己) can be perceived; and the Five Phases and Four Images of water, fire, wood, and metal cannot coalesce.\n\n**116. Upper Closure and Lower Closure**\nThe *Cantong Qi*’s chapter *\"Knowing the White, Guarding the Black\"* states:\n*\"Upper closure is called ‘being’; lower closure is called ‘nonbeing.’\nNonbeing serves to uphold the upper; above dwells the virtue of spirit.\nThese two apertures follow the method—\nthe qi of metal also requires them.\"*\n\nThese lines are rather difficult to comprehend. In brief, they describe the harmonious fusion of heart and breath within the mysterious aperture, uniting above and below to merge obscurely at the center, where yin and yang wondrously conjoin and return to the primordial state before the Emperor of Images.\n\nHere, I cite the teachings of the Eastern and Western Patriarchs to fully elucidate their meaning.\n\n**Patriarch Lu’s *Qianxu* states:**\n*\"What is upper closure? Above is yang, Kan (坎), *wu* (戊), and emotion; below is yin, Li (離), *ji* (己), and nature. ‘Closure’ means not to release. Upper closure refers to the precelestial lead within Kan, whose signs have yet to emerge; lower closure refers to the long-accumulated postcelestial mercury within Li, firmly sealed and not released. Though its signs remain unmanifest, within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal—thus, upper closure is called ‘being.’ Internally nurturing the self in tranquil emptiness, lower closure is called ‘nonbeing.’ ‘Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper’: ‘serving’ implies reverent and meticulous devotion. ‘Above dwells the virtue of spirit’: the virtue of spirit, the true *qi* of Zhenyi (真乙), resides in the abode of Kan-*wu*. When it arrives, it is called ‘being,’ while ‘nonbeing’ watches over it with utmost care, receiving it with reverence, like a minister serving his lord, without the slightest error. Only then can one initially preserve nonbeing and guard being, and ultimately merge emotion with nature, completing the work of the active path.\"*",

      "translated_text": "These two aspects constitute the method of the apertures’ functioning, a knowledge unattainable without a master. Laozi said: “Ever desiring, one observes its portals.” He also declared: “The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.” Zhongli Quan remarked: “The gate that gives me life, the door that takes my death.” All these describe a single aperture divided in two, what is termed “different names yet the same origin.” Within this aperture lies the mutual necessity of metal and *qi*, their sufficiency in mutual support. Knowing their interdependence, one may examine and seek it, reverently uphold and guard it.\n\nMaster Hanxu stated: “Above and below are Heaven and Earth. Closure is profound union. Nonbeing and being are the wondrous aperture. ‘Termed’ refers to naming and describing. One above, one below—both are concealed within this aperture. Whether being or nonbeing, all reside within this aperture. When one attains emptiness and guards stillness, at the moment Heaven and Earth profoundly unite, one may observe its wonder. The wondrous being of things cannot be named yet may be named—thus it is termed ‘being.’ This is what is meant by ‘Within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal.’ Observing its portal through nonbeing, the aperture of emptiness may be described yet cannot be described—thus it is termed ‘nonbeing.’ This is what is meant by ‘Within it there is something that returns to nothingness.’\n\n‘Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper’—this is not mere empty return, but the primordial true lead. It is what Laozi described as ‘the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, which one meets without seeing its head, follows without seeing its tail.’ In the elixir method, using nonbeing to uphold the upper is to transform nonbeing into being. What is meant by ‘upholding’? Who reverently upholds? Who mutually supports? When the virtue of spirit dwells in reverence, its *qi* naturally returns. Returning is upholding. The only fear is that above there be no virtue of spirit. ‘Above’ refers to the upper Yellow Court; ‘virtue’ refers to the virtue of humility. As the *Cantong Qi* states: ‘Reversion is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue.’ To attain emptiness, one employs the Dao; to seek lead, one employs virtue. Virtue is active, while the Dao is nonactive—this method must not be misunderstood.\n\nThe two apertures are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the place where the golden elixir transforms and takes form. When one knows the method of pursuit and absorption within the single aperture and two apertures, both gates open. Only then does metal return to nature, and it may be called the Reverted Elixir. Thus it is said: ‘Metal and *qi* are mutually necessary.’ ‘Mutually necessary’ refers to this method of absorption.”\n\nThe *Zhongzi Zhizhi* further states: “Revisiting the *Cantong Qi*: ‘Upper closure is called being; lower closure is called nonbeing.’ I humbly suggest that these ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ characters are both concealed within the character ‘middle.’ Yin and yang come and go within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between them, merging upper and lower into its midst. Thus, when the upper is closed and the lower is sealed, the mechanism is subtle and refined. Within the Great Void, the primordial *qi* operates alone—thus it is termed ‘nonbeing.’ This is also the purport of observing the wondrous. When the lower is closed and the upper is sealed, it remains hidden and unmanifest. Yet within the profound obscurity there is essence, and within it lies a signal—thus it is termed ‘being.’ This is also the purport of observing the aperture. Whether upper closure or lower closure, both return to the Mysterious Female. Desire and desirelessness all reside within the subtle and mysterious. Thus, the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass may be called the wondrous aperture of being and nonbeing, the upper and lower cauldrons, the yin-yang tripod, or the cavity of spirit and *qi*—all derive from this, all are encompassed within the one center.”\n\nI note that the *Cantong Qi* reveals the substance and function of the Mysterious Pass. In the previous section on the Mysterious Pass, it states: “Square and round, a span in diameter, blended and mutually supporting, born before Heaven and Earth, majestic and lofty”—this describes its substance. Here, it reveals its function. What is its function? It is the method of heart and breath interdependence, the purport of observing the wondrous aperture together. “Closure” is like double doors profoundly united, a casket and its lid in perfect accord—the heart is the wondrous emptiness, the breath is the wondrous being. “Above and below” are heart and breath. Uniting the heart with the breath is nonbeing becoming being—thus it is said: “Upper closure is called being.” Uniting the breath with the heart is being becoming nonbeing—thus it is said: “Lower closure is called nonbeing.” Drawing upper and lower into the center is the convergence of the Two Modes into the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThus, when heart and breath wondrously unite and congeal, the life and nature of the entire body merge, and the purport of returning to the root and restoring life is attained. At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, when the solitary yang returns, the time is spiritually known. One then employs the lower body to welcome it, not missing the stirring of the line. Like a host welcoming a guest who then takes the seat of honor, the host attends with utmost humility and deference—thus it is said: “Nonbeing serves to uphold the upper; above dwells the virtue of spirit.” The “virtue of spirit” refers to the primordial one *qi*. The ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens is spiritually wondrous and unfathomable, the convergence of all virtues—thus it is praised as the virtue of spirit.\n\nThe external and internal communication of the zi-wu work pertains to the fire times. This single aperture of the Mysterious Pass possesses the wonder of yin and yang opening and closing, movement and stillness mutually residing—thus it is called the “cavity of two apertures” or the “gate of wu-ji.” “Metal and *qi* are mutually necessary” means that the ancestral *qi* of the prior heavens must return through this. In sum, when spirit settles and *qi* returns, emptiness and being wondrously unite, and water and fire mutually assist. These several phrases in the *Cantong Qi* trace back to the ancient sage’s meaning in “Know the masculine, guard the feminine; know the white, guard the black; ever virtue does not depart, ever virtue does not err.” Only here “black and white” are changed to “upper and lower”—both are metaphors for the interdependence of heart and breath. As *Zhuangzi* said: “One below, one above, harmony as their measure.”",
      "overlap_context": "rving’ implies reverent and meticulous devotion. ‘Above dwells the virtue of spirit’: the virtue of spirit, the true *qi* of Zhenyi (真乙), resides in the abode of Kan-*wu*. When it arrives, it is called ‘being,’ while ‘nonbeing’ watches over it with utmost care, receiving it with reverence, like a minister serving his lord, without the slightest error. Only then can one initially preserve nonbeing and guard being, and ultimately merge emotion with nature, completing the work of the active path.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The aforementioned \"upper and lower\" likewise refer to the heart and breath. ¹¹⁷\n\n**Knowing Harmony and Knowing the Constant**\nThe essential principle of elixir methods lies in a single word: harmony. *Liezi* states: \"Harmony is the great sameness with all things.\" *Zhuangzi* says: \"One below, one above, harmony as their measure.\" He also says: \"Virtue is harmony,\" and \"Virtue is the cultivation of harmony achieved\"; \"In the midst of silence, harmony alone is heard\"; \"He who understands virtue as the power of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root and great origin, one who harmonizes with Heaven\"; \"Thus he regulates all under Heaven, harmonizing with others. One who harmonizes with others is called human joy; one who harmonizes with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.\" \"Embracing virtue and warming harmony, one thereby accords with all under Heaven.\" Guangchengzi says: \"I guard the One and thereby abide in harmony.\" The ancient sage says: \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with the qi of the void as their harmony.\" He also says: \"Knowing harmony is called the constant; knowing the constant is called clarity.\" \"Supreme yin is solemn and still; supreme yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness arises from Earth; blazing brightness arises from Heaven. The two intermingle and form harmony, and things are born therefrom.\"\n\nI say: harmony is the image of heart and breath in concord, yin and yang of the same kind following one another. When heart and breath depend upon one another, the yin and yang of my body intermingle and form harmony. Then, with the harmony of my body, I summon the harmony of Heaven and Earth. I unite with Heaven and Earth, and the harmony of Heaven and Earth becomes my harmony—thus I unite my virtue with that of Heaven and Earth. When heart and breath depend upon one another, spirit and qi both become still, and one is able to guard their true constancy. Stillness prolonged naturally settles; extreme settlement gives rise to clarity, and realm and wisdom interpenetrate. Thus knowing the constant is called clarity. Harmony, constancy, and clarity—these three are one. Yet the work has its proper sequence and cannot be rushed. *The Scripture of the Five Kitchens* says: \"When the qi is harmonized with the Great Harmony, attaining the One, the Dao is everywhere at peace.\" *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: \"When there is harmony, there is following.\" It also says: \"Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating at the proper time. Each attains its harmony, and all emit confirming signs.\" Master Qianxu says: \"The word 'harmony' is most apt and incisive.\" He also says: \"When the medicine arises, it is called the tally; when the medicine is completed, it is called the confirmation—both arise from harmonious qi.\" *The Seal* says: \"When there is harmony, there is following; the path is level and not deviant.\" Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor: \"I guard the One and thereby abide in harmony.\" Now, the immortal elders model themselves on the sun and moon, balancing water and fire, and conclude with the single word \"harmony\"—profound and subtle indeed! It also says: \"Abiding in harmony is harmonizing the sequence of yin and yang qi.\" *The Seal of the Unity of the Three* says: \"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.\" It also says: \"Observe and examine with careful diligence; scrutinize and regulate cold and warmth.\" This is abiding in harmony. Harmony is what the elixir masters call \"fire timing.\" I note that the character for \"elixir\" (*dan*) is an image of the sun and moon in harmony—thus from beginning to end, harmony is its function. Heart and breath merging in darkness is harmony; Kan and Li intermingling is harmony; Qian and Kun uniting is harmony. *The Emerald Writ* says: \"When spirit and qi merge in darkness and qi returns, bones and flesh fuse in harmony, and one knows nothing of it.\" *The Heart Seal Scripture* says: \"When the Great Harmony fills and overflows, the bones scatter like cold jade.\" The wondrous function of harmony is evident. Thus knowing harmony is the essential element of long life and enduring vision. Therefore, one who can attain harmony can also attain constancy. Constancy is true constancy. *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says: \"The true constant responds to things; the true constant attains nature.\" It also says: \"The Dao of true constancy is attained by those who awaken; those who awaken to the Dao are perpetually pure and still.\" From this, one may know that true constancy is the numinous clarity of one’s original nature. The numinous clarity of original nature is one’s true self, enduring through kalpas without destruction—thus it is so named. ¹¹⁸\n\n**Knowing the Masculine and Guarding the Feminine**\nThe ancient sage says: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be the valley of all under Heaven. Being the valley of all under Heaven, ever virtue does not depart, and one returns to the state of an infant.\" The so-called masculine and feminine refer approximately to heart and breath, spirit and qi. Knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine means uniting spirit with breath, causing nature and life to return to the One—this is returning from the Two Modes to the Supreme Ultimate. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and true yang naturally arrives. Stirring the wind of Xun to respond to it, one breaks through the passes and ascends to the crown—like the waters of the Yellow River surging and reversing upward, which the elixir classics call the \"River Chariot.\" Patriarch Lü says: \"White clouds ascend to the upper palace; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\" Longmeizi says: \"Sweet dew fills the void, nourishing the ten thousand things; a single stream of numinous spring overflows the long river.\" Wei Boyang says: \"Cultivate without ceasing, and the qi will move like clouds and rain. Dripping like spring moisture, flowing like melting ice. From the head it flows to the feet, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless cavern, gently pervading the space within.\" The image of being \"the valley of all under Heaven\" is truly like this. From this, the prior and posterior heavens naturally fuse in harmony, not departing from true emptiness, while qi is full and spirit is tranquil—without thought, without worry, the three minds are all extinguished, the four forms forgotten, in a state of primal chaos, returning to the state of an infant—this is called \"returning to youth.\" Its wondrous subtlety lies in knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine. Master Hanxu’s *Eastern Clarification of the Right* further sets forth two principles to elucidate the meaning of this chapter: first, the masculine acts and the feminine transforms; second, the masculine returns and the feminine conceals. When the feminine and masculine interact, metal is hidden within water, and water in turn gives birth to metal.",

      "translated_text": "When metal qi is full, the tidal surge arrives—its force like that of a canal stream, flowing backward and surging upward. This is the water of the world’s canal streams. The *Cantong Qi* states: “The masculine Yang scatters the mysterious, the feminine Yin governs the yellow transformation.” Herein lies one meaning of “knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine.”\n\nFurthermore, if we discuss the principle of generating things, when Yin reaches its extreme, Yang arises—this is the feminine harboring the masculine. If we discuss the matter of nurturing things, when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises—this is the masculine harboring the feminine. The masculine harboring the feminine means that, having obtained the return of the masculine to form the elixir, one must further rely on the feminine’s concealment to warm the elixir. Its force is like that of mountain streams, flowing from above and pouring downward into the valley. Thus, the Way of guarding the feminine is like the world’s streams and valleys—flowing and returning, returning to the valley, just as it returns to the Yellow Court, and again to the state of an infant, entering stillness to nurture the sacred embryo. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “The masculine harboring the feminine knits the sacred embryo.” Herein lies another meaning of “knowing the masculine and guarding the feminine.”\n\nThese two principles expound the profound classics’ essential teachings, elucidating them with depth and clarity, revealing what predecessors had not. Yet, in terms of practice, they are merely transformations within the interdependence of heart and breath. The first principle reveals the gathering of the primordial Yang within the brightness of the moon—spirit and breath intermingling to summon the return of the single Yang. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram, where water gives birth to metal, signifying the return of the single Yang. The second principle reveals the warming and nurturing: when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to the *Gou* hexagram. After obtaining the elixir, one circulates it with the fire of spirit, ensuring that spirit and qi remain inseparable, until spirit and qi transform together and the embryo is perfected. Within movement lies stillness, thus fulfilling the work of nurturing the embryo. Within stillness, movement returns, thus arousing the generation of primordial Yang. By alternating movement and stillness, the Dao of the elixir is complete. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “From *Fu* and *Gou* one can henceforth apply the work—who says the golden elixir cannot be achieved?” How profound these words are!\n\n---\n\n119. Knowing the White and Guarding the Black\nThe Old Sage said: “Know the white, guard the black—this is the model for the world. As the model for the world, constant virtue does not err, returning to the boundless.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the ultimate of the Dao, its number named One.” Lu Xixing said: “The so-called numinous brightness is the power of spirit. The white is the essence of metal, which is the qi of metal. Among the five phases’ qi, metal can generate water. Yet in the creation of the returned elixir, the primordial white metal is born within the water of Kan. Thus, those who refine the elixir must empty the heart and humble the self, reverently seeking lead from Kan. When the time arrives and the mechanism moves, the numinous brightness will come of itself—then ‘suddenly, in the dead of night, a single thunderclap opens ten thousand doors in sequence,’ and the wondrous interplay of mutual necessity appears.” Master Hanxu said: “The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water.”",

      "translated_text": "The metal essence arises when yang, the male, sows its seed within the female and is born. Before this essence came to be, the body of Mother Kun was originally empty. Through the mingling of her light with Father Qian’s radiance, Kun became replete and formed Kan. Once the form of Kan was complete, the moon emitted its light from the direction of Dui—this is called the metal within water. The metal within water truly relies on Mother Kun’s nurturing to take form, and so it is called the mother qi. As *The Awakening to Reality* says, “Extracting the white from the black becomes the elixir mother.” The mother qi possesses a white light, known as the yang light. When the yang light appears, one circulates one’s own mercury to welcome it—this is what is meant by “seeking the medicine in the second phase.” When the two correspond, the two eights of the same kind are captured in the same moment, refined into the yang elixir, which is the elixir mother. Yet because its transformation occurs externally, the elixir mother is only considered the outer medicine. The practitioner refines the inner medicine with the outer medicine, subduing the child qi with the mother qi. Within the elixir mother, yang lead is then produced, which is transported by the river chariot, returned in reverse to the original palace, and concealed within the earthen crucible. After the four phases harmonize and the three natures unite in joy, this moment of bliss attains longevity. Though the method of practice is thus, to know the white one must first guard the black; only by guarding the black can one know the white. Yet even after knowing the white, one must still guard the black—within this lies a threefold wondrous function, which serves as the world’s model and standard. If one can practice accordingly, the constant virtue of the natural order will not err, and without error, one may return to verify the limitless, refining the spirit to restore the void.\n\nTo know the white one must first guard the black is yang entering within yin. To guard the black and thereby know the white is yin giving birth to yang. To know the white and yet still guard the black is the spirit returning and qi submitting. The principle of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is all thus—hence it is the world’s model and standard.",

When the time arrives and the mechanism moves, the numinous brightness will come of itself—then ‘suddenly, in the dead of night, a single thunderclap opens ten thousand doors in sequence,’ and the wondrous interplay of mutual necessity appears.” Master Hanxu said: “The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water.”",

      "translated_text": "Xuanjing said: The Eastern and Western Patriarchs have elucidated the essence of the Golden Elixir with utmost clarity and precision. Yet what they revealed pertains primarily to the principles and subtleties of the practice. In terms of actual cultivation, it is nothing other than the wondrous union of mind and breath, where stillness gives birth to yang, true emptiness resonates with wondrous being, and wondrous being in turn merges with true emptiness. Spirit and breath harmonize, nature and life become one, coalescing into a single whole to form the embryo of the Dao.\n\nBlack and white are but symbolic terms, referring to yin and yang, and ultimately to the body, mind, spirit, and qi. At the outset, the spirit governs qi, and the breath’s ebb and flow may be faintly perceived externally. One must neither fixate on it nor be entirely without awareness. I simply allow it to exist naturally, then forget it naturally, gradually dissolving into profound obscurity and entering the state of harmonious equilibrium. At the initial union of yin and yang, beauty resides within—this is the foundational work of \"knowing the white by first guarding the black.\"\n\nWhen spirit and breath stabilize externally, the outer breath ceases, the sun and moon conjoin like jade disks, and one stands at the threshold of *bo* and *fu*, between the dark of the moon and the new moon. At this moment, one enters the third stage of *Huozi’s* \"Realm of Earth,\" a state of utter stillness and immobility. Yet having returned to pure *kun*, with inner and outer both stilled and thoughts and breath dissolved, forming the symbol ○ (internally as *ji* earth, externally as *wu* earth), the pure *qian* of the void must respond and arrive. The first stirring of yang arises, and when the time comes, the spirit knows—this is the natural correspondence of the wondrous tally. In an instant of awakening, one departs from the physical body, and the mind and breath depend on each other externally (for I originally have no breath; only when the spirit moves does qi move, thus transforming into breath). This is what is meant by \"arousing the *xun* wind, moving the *kun* fire, lightly lifting, silently circulating\"—the second stage of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\"\n\nAs spirit and breath gradually harmonize and merge, one enters true stillness once more. At this point, inner and outer are entirely forgotten, mind and environment both stilled, self and dharma both forgotten, returning to the limitless. The primordial true yang thus evoked will not escape, \"sent back to the earthen cauldron and sealed securely.\" This is the third stage of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\"\n\nThe practitioner must understand that the elixir method must not cling even slightly to the physical body. Clinging leads to leakage of essence and loss of the elixir, giving rise to countless faults. One must enter the state of primordial chaos, return to the limitless, like a living corpse, forgetting even this state of stillness. Where there is no \"no,\" only profound tranquility remains—then qi congeals and the elixir gathers, and the transformations of the six dragons are complete. From the initial step of refining essence into qi to the final stage of refining spirit to return to the void, merging with the Dao in forgetfulness, the process is consistently thus. Therefore, the enlightened find it simple and easy, while the deluded make it increasingly complex and difficult.\n\nThe supreme elixir method takes true emptiness as the guiding principle of practice. The longer one abides in the great stillness of true emptiness, the swifter the effects. When, throughout the twelve hours of the day, not a moment passes without being in this great stillness—so that one cannot even find the breath—then naturally the embryo matures and the spirit emerges (the dharmakāya separates from the physical body).\n\nThe above speaks specifically of the practice, revealing the true oral instructions of \"knowing the white by guarding the black.\" Initially, yang enters within yin (concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, the sun moving into the moon’s brightness) to seek lead—this is what Patriarch Li meant by \"to know the white, one must first guard the black.\" In the middle stage, yang is born within yin, stillness giving way to movement—this is \"by guarding the black, one can know the white.\" Finally, the spirit returns and qi submits, wondrously entering the realm of great stillness, the state of profound tranquility, where prior and posterior heaven naturally harmonize. Gradually gathering and congealing, the elixir forms—this is \"knowing the white and yet still guarding the black.\"\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold the master’s power.\" Day and night signify movement and stillness. The \"master\" is the host of qi, and \"power\" is the function of the spirit. Refining with literary fire and forging with martial heat, ceasing the fire and nurturing with warmth—only after three returns is the work complete. This aligns with the principles expounded by Patriarch Hanxu. Is this not the profound mechanism of returning to life and the bridge to returning to the origin?\n\n---\n\nThe Old Sage said: \"There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth. Silent and void, it stands alone and unchanging, circulating without end. It may be called the Mother of all under heaven. I know not its name; I style it the Dao.\"\n\nThe commentary states: The virtue of this formless completion is the ocean of perfect enlightenment. In movement, it becomes the true unity of qi, the foundation of the Daoist practice of fulfilling destiny. In stillness, it pervades and contains all, becoming the Tathāgata-garbha, the wondrous true suchness of mind—the foundation of the Buddhist practice of cultivating nature. Before movement and stillness divide, nature and life return to one. This is the primordial, utterly true body, empty, silent, vast, and pure, pervading all without a name—hence it is forcibly called the Dao. All transcendent dharmas arise from it, and all worldly dharmas are established by it; thus, it is also called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nMaster Fu said:\n*\"There is a thing before heaven and earth,\nFormless, originally silent and void.\nIt can be the master of all phenomena,\nUnchanging through the four seasons.\"*\n\nHis meaning is the same as the Old Sage’s.\n\nThe *Daode Jing* further states: \"All people have their means; I alone am dull and coarse. I alone differ from others in valuing the nourishment of the Mother.\" It also says: \"The world has a beginning, which may be regarded as the Mother of the world. Having attained the Mother, one knows her children. Having known the children, one returns to guard the Mother. Thus, one does not perish even in death.\" This teaching of nourishing and guarding the Mother is the essence revered by the profound tradition, the constant practice of Daoists, and the key to returning and restoration.",

To use one’s light and return to clarity—this is guarding the Mother. The study of guarding the Mother is the profound mechanism of returning to life. One who can return to life may then inherit the Dao and merge with its truth.\n\n---\n\n**Embracing the One and Attaining the One**\nThe Daoist sages say: *\"The sage embraces the One as the model for all under heaven.\"* They also say: *\"Of old, those who attained the One: Heaven attained the One and became clear; Earth attained the One and became tranquil; spirits attained the One and became numinous; valleys attained the One and became full; the myriad things attained the One and came to life; lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven—all these arose from the One.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"When one is permeated by the One, the myriad affairs are complete.\"* Baopuzi said: *\"The Dao arises from the One, and its value is peerless. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard. When preserved, it is present; when neglected, it vanishes. Facing it brings fortune; turning from it brings misfortune. Safeguarding it ensures boundless blessings; losing it leads to withered form and exhausted qi.\"* Laozi said: *\"Vague and indistinct, yet within it are images; indistinct and vague, yet within it are things.\"* This refers to the One.\n\nThus, the immortal classics say: *\"If you desire long life, guard the One with clarity. When hungry, the One provides sustenance; when thirsty, the One offers drink. The One can generate yin and engender yang, regulate the cycles of cold and heat. Spring attains the One and sprouts; summer attains the One and grows; autumn attains the One and harvests; winter attains the One and stores. Its vastness cannot be measured by the six directions; its minuteness cannot be compared to a hair’s tip.\"*\n\nMaster Bai said: *\"This is the true qi of the One, prior to the ten thousand images, the Great Void, the Great Non-Being, the Great Emptiness, the Great Origin. Dim and obscure, it cannot be measured by inches; vast and boundless, it cannot be fathomed by shores. Its greatness has no exterior; its smallness has no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the tip of a hair. Above, it transcends color; below, it transcends depth. One thing, perfectly complete, manifesting through the ages. That which cannot be named, the sages grasp with their hearts, and out of necessity call it the Dao.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"To concentrate qi and attain suppleness, to contain light and remain silent, to nurture correctness and maintain fullness, to guard the feminine and embrace the One—with the mind unmoving, the myriad conditions grow still. Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures are not equal to guarding the One. Guard the One, and the myriad methods return to the One. Attain the One, and one transcends the posterior heaven to avoid death; lose the One, and one decays with things. Build with the One as the foundation, gather with the One as the medicine, refine with the One as the fire, congeal with the One as the elixir, nurture with the One as the sacred embryo, circulate with the One as the withdrawal and replenishment, sustain with the One as the sealing, and purify with the One as the bathing.\"*\n\nMaster Xuanjing said: *\"The so-called One is the qi of wondrous existence, called the primordial ancestral qi, also known as the true qi of the One. When speaking of qi, it is in terms of its circulation; when speaking of spirit, it is in terms of its numinosity; when speaking of essence, it is in terms of its coagulation. In reality, it is one thing.\"*\n\nThe Daoist tradition attains the One to achieve truth; the Confucian tradition attains the One to participate in transformation; the Chan tradition attains the One to illuminate the mind. Thus, the Three Teachings all value attaining the One. After attaining it, one guards it like a hen brooding over an egg, like a dragon nurturing a pearl—this is called \"embracing the One,\" the work of ten months of gestation. Attaining the One is the effect of congealing the elixir. One attains it in stillness; one embraces it in quiescence. With body and mind profoundly settled, the effects manifest naturally.\n\nMaster Bai said: *\"From emptiness and spontaneity, being arises from non-being. The ten thousand things are one thing, and the one is most precious to guard. The whirling wind merges, and the whole day feels like intoxication. The great dream awakens, thunder roars and lightning flashes. Clouds disperse and rain scatters—heaven endures and earth abides.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Like a dragon nurturing a pearl, the heart does not forget; like a hen brooding over an egg, the qi does not cease.

      "translated_text": "The *Cantong Qi* states: \"When metal comes to return to the original nature, it may then be called the Returned Elixir.\" Yet in recent times, alchemists have further distinguished between the Lesser Return Elixir and the Greater Return Elixir. The *Strange Encounters at Sea and Mountain* records that Li Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, obtained the Lesser Return Elixir and lived for several centuries without his appearance aging. When the Patriarch Lü encountered him in Jurong, he taught him to refine the Golden Fluid Greater Return Elixir. The old man joyfully received the instruction. The Patriarch Lü said: \"Reset the furnace, reestablish the crucible, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm.\" This precisely refers to the Greater Return.\n\nWhere, then, lies the distinction between the Greater and Lesser Returns? Explanations among authors have varied, but following the transmitted teachings, we here elucidate their meaning: Since the breaking of the original body, the postnatal Kan and Li have taken charge. The practitioner begins with the interdependence of heart and breath, progressing until the ordinary breath ceases entirely, body and mind enter profound stillness, and inner and outer become utterly quiescent. Thereupon, the primordial One Qi emerges from the midst of emptiness, and the work of gathering and absorbing begins. Thus, my pure yin responds to its pure yang, returning from the postnatal to the prenatal. Each time the work is performed, the prenatal true yang arrives once, returning from without to within the body. Hence the *Cantong Qi* says: \"When metal comes to return to the original nature, it may then be called the Returned Elixir.\"\n\nAs the work advances, true yang gathers ever more, until qi is full and the fire is withdrawn, forming the Returned Elixir—this is called the Lesser Return. The Lesser Return is the initial return, wherein yin responds to yang, corresponding to the *Yijing*’s *Tai* hexagram: \"The small departs, the great arrives.\" This stage of the work is termed \"borrowing from Kan to fill Li\" in alchemical texts. When true qi is fully abundant and the Li palace is filled, the Qian body is restored—this is called \"returning to youth\" in alchemical texts.\n\nAfter returning to youth, the inner being is purely Qian. The practitioner then enters samadhi and true stillness, using one’s Qian yang to respond to the primordial Qian yang true qi, merging the inner and outer layers of the prenatal to produce the Great Medicine—this is called the Great Elixir, or the Greater Return. It is the work of the seven-day Great Celestial Circuit. The Greater Return embodies the image of double Qian. The Patriarch Lü’s poem on obtaining the Greater Return Elixir says: \"Refining and refining until reaching Qian Qian, only then is one a drunken immortal among men.\" This serves as proof. The *Yijing* states: \"All day long Qian Qian, returning and repeating the Dao.\" The image of Qian Qian is the esoteric principle of the Greater Return. \"Returning and repeating\" means returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, then from the prenatal to that which precedes the prenatal. Only upon reaching the realm of double Qian are the transformations of the six dragons complete, and one may then govern and command Heaven.\n\nThus, in the alchemical method, when the postnatal responds to the prenatal, the medicine obtained is called the Lesser Medicine, the elixir formed is called the Lesser Elixir, and the celestial circuit performed is called the Lesser Celestial Circuit. When one’s prenatal pure yang responds to the prenatal pure yang, merging the inner and outer layers of the prenatal, the medicine obtained is called the Great Medicine, the elixir formed is called the Great Elixir, and the celestial circuit performed is called the Great Celestial Circuit. The *Yijing*’s Lesser Accumulation and Greater Accumulation, and the Dao’s Lesser Return and Greater Return, share the same meaning. Though divided into greater and lesser, the progress of the work fundamentally does not depart from the interdependence of heart and breath. Once true emptiness and great stillness are attained, inner and outer harmonize and merge. The Lesser Celestial Circuit proceeds within stillness, and the Great Celestial Circuit likewise proceeds within stillness. The Lesser Return Elixir forms within stillness, and the Greater Return Elixir likewise forms within stillness. Only the depth of stillness differs, hence the results vary.\n\nFurthermore, after the Lesser Return Elixir is formed, one must apply the fire of nurturing the elixir, allowing it to mature fully and perform the Great Celestial Circuit, obtaining the Great Medicine and completing the Greater Return. After the Great Elixir is formed, one must apply the fire of nurturing the embryo, enduring for ten months until the embryo is fully developed and the birth occurs—this is called \"emerging as spirit.\" Beyond this lie further practices of tempering and nourishing, called \"nursing.\" At this point, the great work of becoming an immortal is complete.\n\n---\n\nLaozi said: \"Much speech hastens exhaustion; it is better to abide in the center.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Riding things to roam the heart, entrusting to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection.\" Abiding in the center and nurturing the center share the same meaning. Master Chongxu said: \"The center is not the center of the middle; it is the center of emptiness and void. Abiding is not clinging and guarding; it is the abiding of utmost emptiness.\" When the practitioner unites heart and breath at the center of emptiness outside the body, this is the study of abiding in the center. From the union of heart and breath, nature and life return to the origin, congealing into the embryo of the Dao. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Managing and nurturing the calyx, congealing spirit to form the body.\" It also says: \"The three luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the pearl of the child.\" This is the work of nurturing the center.\n\nTo speak plainly: the original spirit and original qi circulate within emptiness. The original spirit, nourished by the original qi, becomes ever more luminous and yang, ultimately transcending the embryo to manifest as a perfected being. Thus, the union of heart and breath in emptiness is called abiding in the center. The blending of spirit and qi in emptiness into a single whole is called nurturing the center. Master Chongxu said: \"One who preserves the substance of the center does not abide in a single thought, remaining utterly still, abiding until food and pulse both cease, sleep and dullness vanish entirely, yet never departing from stillness for even a moment. One who exhausts the function of the center keeps the numinous light unobscured, utterly transcending the roots of the dust.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Guard until the two qi both vanish, thoughts arise and cease no more, yet never for even a moment depart from illumination.\"\n\nMaster Hanxu said: \"The wondrous realm of the center naturally nurtures the self by congealing spirit. Entering the chamber to return the elixir, and even transcending the embryo to manifest as a perfected being—all depend on this. Thus, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this center, for it is the path to advancement. In ancient times, Lord Wen Shi asked the Most High: ‘What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the Dao?’ The Most High replied: ‘It lies in deep roots and firm stems, in guarding the center and embracing the One.’\"\n\nI say: When spirit and qi unite in emptiness, then guarding the center and nurturing the center are threaded as one.\n\n---\n\n**125. Nurturing the Elixir and Nurturing the Embryo**\n\nThe alchemical practice of *wenyang* (warm nurturing) truly comprises two stages: nurturing the elixir and nurturing the embryo. When refining essence to transform qi is complete, one ceases the fire to prevent leakage of qi. When the cessation of fire takes effect, the result is the formation of the elixir. At the initial formation of the elixir, gazing steadily beneath lamplight, a black dot appears before the eyes—unseen in daylight. Upon seeing this dot, one knows the elixir has formed and must then apply the fire of warm nurturing to cultivate it. The black dot before the eyes gradually turns red and yellow, until it appears golden when viewed in sunlight, signaling the completion of the Lesser Return Elixir.\n\n*The Marvelous Encounter at Sea Mountain* records that Li Qi, the recluse of Huayang, obtained the Lesser Return Elixir and lived for several centuries without aging. When Ancestor Lü traveled to Jurong, he encountered Li in the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven—this was the Lesser Return Elixir. The fire phases for nurturing this elixir have been transmitted orally from sage to sage and are not recorded in books; this compilation makes no exception. For this work’s purpose is only to reveal the initial steps for prolonging life and enhancing vitality. The most profound oral secrets, not practicable by all, remain unrecorded.\n\nOnce the Lesser Return Elixir is fully nurtured, one proceeds to the Greater Celestial Cycle, transcending the mundane to attain sagehood. This Greater Celestial Cycle also involves three fire phases, transmitted orally and not committed to writing. After practicing the Greater Celestial Cycle for an appropriate period, there is a seven-day process of passing through the Greater Celestial Cycle, yielding the Great Medicine and achieving the Greater Return. Following the Greater Celestial Cycle comes the ten-month practice of nurturing the embryo—the second stage of warm nurturing. When the great samādhi is perfected and spirit is whole, one emerges as spirit.\n\nThus, the first stage of warm nurturing, which matures the elixir, pertains to the Lesser Return and produces earthbound immortals. When a practitioner’s work reaches the stage of elixir formation, even if they encounter calamity and die, their single spirit remains sovereign, allowing them to freely choose rebirth or seize another’s body—far surpassing ordinary people.\n\n---\n\n**126. Facing the Origin and Returning to the Origin**\n\nLongmei Zi’s *Poems on the Verification of the Golden Elixir* discusses *chaoyuan* (facing the origin):\n\n> \"When form and spirit are both wondrous, the Dao is their companion;\n> Cultivating both nature and life, they merge with the Great Void.\n> When the imperial edict descends, one mounts a crane in flight;\n> After receiving the jade script, one rides a dragon chariot.\n> The glory of immortal officials is debated in terms of rank,\n> While the turbid world’s trials are escaped to dwell in peace.\n> Through accumulated virtue and diligent seeking, all may attain;\n> Why then do you alone hesitate?\"\n\nIt also discusses *huanyuan* (returning to the origin):\n\n> \"Not south, nor east—where is it?\n> The wondrous single spirit is originally unobstructed.\n> The worthy and foolish are fundamentally without distinction;\n> The mundane and sacred have never differed.\n> Reddening cinnabar through repetition becomes habit;\n> Calling ‘mother’ instead of ‘mama’ is but a skillful means.\n> All conditioned things are unreal—\n> Awaken to the true source, where emptiness is not empty.\"\n\nXuanjing said: *Chaoyuan* confers immortal office, whether ascending in broad daylight or lifting one’s dwelling to soar—akin to passing the imperial examination and receiving an official post. The final step, the emptying of the heart to pass the ultimate test, is the pinnacle of Dao cultivation, where function is exhausted and effort forgotten. Within the ever-quiescent light, there is no attachment or hindrance—what then matters the presence or absence of an imperial edict? Thus, the Mysterious School values *huanyuan* above *chaoyuan*.\n\n---\n\n**127. The Greater Yang and the Greater Yin**\n\nLiu Wuyuan’s *Women’s Elixir Formula* states: \"The Greater Yang refines qi—this is the principle for men; the Greater Yin refines form—this is the expedient for women.\"\n\nMy teacher once remarked that these two lines dispel millennia of doubts and greatly benefit the *Women’s Elixir Formula*. Since ancient times, it has been held that men refine qi while women refine form, with different starting points. This has led heterodox schools to seize upon it as justification, creating separate methods for the Greater Yang refining qi and the Greater Yin refining form. Little do they realize this refers to the postnatal realm; in the prenatal Great Dao, men and women begin without distinction.\n\nMy teacher said: \"The so-called Greater Yang refining qi means heart and breath depend on each other externally, so the heart becomes empty. When the heart is empty, the heart-fire naturally descends, and the water of the lower *kan* transforms into qi and ascends—this is the harmonization of *kan* and *li*. It is like sunlight shining down, causing seawater to transform into qi and rise. The Greater Yang refining qi is nothing more than this principle.\n\nThe phrase ‘Greater Yin refining form’ arises because the sun, residing in the *li* position, is inverted to become female—internally yin, externally yang. The internal yin is real; the external yang is illusory. In sum, the Greater Yin is a metaphor for the heart; *form* refers to the body. The ancients spoke of *form and spirit*, or *body and heart*—all ultimately reducible to the two words *yin* and *yang*. The body is qi. Refining qi with the heart is, in reality, the interdependence of heart and breath—identical to the previous line, differing only in wording.\n\nWuyuan saw through this principle, hence calling it an expedient, not an actual event, though the phenomenon exists. To pierce this with a single word requires one who is truly cultivated.\"\n\nThe above explanation by Master Wang is exceedingly precise. The entire elixir method emphasizes practice in the emptiness beyond the body—there is truly no difference between men and women.",

Let us now elucidate their meanings: *Attaining life* means comprehending the principles of life and nurturing it. *Forgetting life* means emptying body and heart, becoming oblivious to them in the Dao.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Attaining Life” chapter states: “Those who attain the essence of life do not pursue what is of no use to life.” It further says: “When form is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. When form and essence are unharmed, this is called *shifting*. Refining essence to ever greater refinement is to return and assist Heaven.” It also cites Master Guan Yin: “He dwells in the measure of non-excess, abides in the boundless axis, and roams through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Unifying his nature, nurturing his qi, harmonizing his virtue, he communicates with the source of all things. One who does so preserves the wholeness of Heaven, his spirit unobstructed—how could external things intrude?”\n\nExplanation: The essence of *attaining life* lies in nurturing qi and storing spirit; the practice is precisely the interdependence of heart and breath. When spirit congeals and essence is restored, true qi surges boundlessly, flowing in unison with Heaven and Earth. Thus one harmonizes virtue with Heaven and Earth, hence the phrase “harmonizing his virtue.” The root of human life lies in true breath. Therefore, regulating the breath to stillness so as to connect with Heaven and Earth’s true yang is the essential element of nurturing life. Only after *attaining life* can one nurture life.\n\nMaster Lü says: “Exhaustively trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth—marvel not that the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.” Master Zi Yang says: “I urge you to exhaustively trace back to the origin of your birth; returning to the root is the Medicine King.” This, too, is the essence of *attaining life*.\n\nAs for *forgetting life*, the practice deepens, body and heart enter stillness, inner and outer both empty, and one realizes the wondrousness of the emptiness of self. The Yellow Emperor says: “When spirit enters its gate, bones and skeleton return to their root—what ‘I’ remains?” The Old Sage says: “Return to the state of no-thing, return to the state of the limitless.” Both express the wondrous purport of *forgetting life*.\n\nWhen these are understood and integrated: In the initial stages of the mysterious teaching, the interdependence of heart and breath must be practiced in the emptiness beyond the body, unattached to form—this is precisely *forgetting life*. When heart and breath settle into oneness, the primordial qi arrives of itself, form is whole and essence restored—this is the effect of *attaining life*. The Old Sage says: “Set the body aside, and the body is preserved.” Master Tan says: “Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.”\n\nMaster Bai Zi Qing says: “Forgetting form to nurture qi is the Golden Liquid; facing phenomena without heart is the Great Return. Forgetting form to nurture qi, qi transforms into spirit—this is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.” To “set aside” and to “forget”—are these not *forgetting life*? To “nurture” and to “return”—are these not *attaining life*?\n\nKnow that when heart and breath interdepend outside the body and reach great stillness, body and heart both forgotten, state and wisdom both dissolved, one attains the wondrousness of *forgetting life* and thereby gains *further life*—what the Old Sage called “being selfless yet able to perfect one’s self.” If one clings to the physical body in practice, this is purely a post-heaven function. Not only does one fail to grasp the principle of *forgetting life*, but one also fails to recognize the essence of nurturing life, diverging far from the true lineage of the mysterious teaching.\n\n**129. Attaining Life and Attaining Destiny**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Lie Yu Kou” chapter states: “Knowledge and wisdom externally connected breed resentment; courageous action invites many grudges; benevolence and righteousness invite many demands. Those who attain the essence of life are *kuai*; those who attain knowledge are *xiao*; those who attain the great destiny follow; those who attain the lesser destiny encounter.”\n\nLu Fang Hu says: “Knowledge and wisdom form one repository—when knowledge and wisdom are externally connected, they breed resentment. Courageous action forms one repository—courageous action invites grudges. Benevolence and righteousness form one repository—benevolence and righteousness invite many demands. Attaining life forms one repository—those who attain the essence of life progress toward reality, becoming *kuai* and greatly liberated. This repository is the highest vehicle. Attaining knowledge forms one repository—those who attain knowledge know Heaven and know humanity, becoming Heaven’s *xiao* offspring. Attaining destiny forms one repository—those who greatly attain say, ‘I follow it’; those who attain in small measure say, ‘I encounter it.’ Encountering implies submitting to destiny; following implies having no deliberate intent—this, too, is the highest vehicle of attaining destiny.”\n\nExplanation: *Attaining life* and *attaining destiny* are the proper duties of the profound scholar. *Attaining* means thorough comprehension. Only after *attaining life* can one cultivate life; only after *attaining destiny* can one fulfill destiny. The practice is simply the interdependence of heart and breath—this is what is meant by *following the breath*. From having breath, one returns to breathlessness, externally connecting with Heaven and Earth’s one qi. When the celestial mechanism is activated, it flows ceaselessly, and the foundation of destiny is thereby eternally secured.\n\n*Kuai* means great, signifying merging with the great naturalness. Those who *attain the great destiny* follow the breath to settle the spirit, live each day in accord with conditions, and ultimately follow the heart’s spontaneity without obstruction. Those who *attain the lesser destiny* merely accept what they encounter without resentment.\n\n**130. Holding the Contract and Holding the Thoroughfare**\nThe Old Sage says: “The sage holds the left contract but does not demand of others. Those with virtue hold the contract; those without virtue hold the thoroughfare.”\n\nSecret Explanation: The contract’s value lies in its correspondence. Heart and breath are the natural wondrous contract.",

To pierce this with a single word requires one who is truly cultivated.\"\n\nThe above explanation by Master Wang is exceedingly precise. The entire elixir method emphasizes practice in the emptiness beyond the body—there is truly no difference between men and women.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage holds the left contract, awaiting the right to come and join. The left contract is the spirit; the right contract is the breath. Concentrating the spirit within the qi cavity (the emptiness beyond the body), one calmly awaits the breath’s approach—no need for the self to seek the breath. One need only wait with utmost sincerity. If the self seeks the breath, the breath may resist alignment, and through forced control, clinging, and rigidity, the breath turns coarse and hard to regulate. Form clings, fire arises—this is precisely the image of *holding the thoroughfare*. Through sincere influence, one allows the breath to return of its own accord, naturally harmonious. Like Emperor Shun’s pacification of the Miao tribes: two ranks of dancers with feathered shields, and after seventy days, the Miao came to submit—this is the subtlety of *holding the contract*. Those who enforce through coercion and military might belong to *holding the thoroughfare*; the Sage does not act thus.\n\n**131. Opening the Human and Opening Heaven**\nThe *Zhuangzi·Dashing Through Life* says: “Do not open the human’s Heaven, but open Heaven’s Heaven. Opening Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. Neither satiate with Heaven nor neglect the human, and the people will nearly return to their true nature.”\n\nLu Xixing says: “Those who cultivate the Dao know the wondrousness of effortless naturalness. Thus, they do not open the human’s Heaven but open Heaven’s Heaven. Opening Heaven’s Heaven means emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and clarity—illuminating the principle of naturalness. Opening the human’s Heaven means deluded knowledge arising, chiseling the undifferentiated aperture. Therefore, opening Heaven gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. *Virtue* means preserving the authenticity of Heaven’s power; *harm* means inflicting the damage of human artifice. Heaven, by this principle, nurtures our lives, yet we harm it—thus severing ourselves from Heaven. We obtain this principle as life, yet fail to preserve it—thus belittling ourselves as human. Neither satiate with Heaven nor neglect the human, and will we not nearly return to the true?”\n\nGui Zhenchuan says: “Heaven is natural; the human possesses knowledge and desire. Opening the human chisels apertures, and the undifferentiated perishes. Guarding qi preserves the human; leveling emotions preserves Heaven—this is the essence of preserving life.”\n\nXuanjing says: “Ordinary people, amid the six dusts of sensory realms, discriminate beauty and ugliness, knowledge proliferates, intellect runs wild, and they falsely claim material enjoyment. Unaware that emotions arise and wisdom is obstructed, they fall into peril. Heart scatters, spirit moves, essence trembles, qi depletes—gradually diminishing, life collapses, and the great destiny topples. This is *opening the human gives birth to harm*. As for those who cultivate the Dao: reversing perception and hearing, embracing emptiness and stillness, body and mind both tranquil—they summon primordial true yang, nourishing the corporeal form and fostering the Dharma-body. Once the mechanism of life is activated, it flows ceaselessly. Soon, spirit is whole, qi is full, the six senses are empty and still, and the power of inherent nature manifests—this is *opening Heaven gives birth to virtue*. Opening Heaven means Heaven’s heart governs, stillness and illumination never part, and the nature of Heaven grows radiant. Opening the human means the human heart governs, and the six senses scatter. This is the difference between following the current and reversing the flow.”\n\n**132. Warming Harmony and Burning Harmony**\nThe Old Sage reveals “harmony through emptiness”; Guangchengzi reveals “abiding in harmony”; Zhuangzi reveals “warming harmony.” The *Xu Wugui* chapter says: “Embracing virtue and warming harmony, one accords with the world—this is called the true person.” *Harmony* refers to the primordial harmonious qi. *Warming* means gently heating with a subtle fire. Using harmonious qi to permeate the four limbs and hundred bones, in extreme emptiness and profound stillness, ebb and flow merge—beauty resides within. This is called *warming harmony*. Thus, the *Huainanzi* also says: “Embracing virtue and warming harmony, the myriad things amass.” *Amass* is the image of ripening.\n\nThe study of warming harmony in the Mystery School is exceedingly subtle. When the practitioner’s effort reaches the point where external breathing becomes faint, naturally the body enters the state: the four limbs and hundred bones feel gently warmed, gradually softening into numbness. Blockages throughout the body gradually dissolve, from the crown to the soles, wholly steeped in the great harmony of the one qi—drunken, entranced. The Immortal School calls this *drinking harmony*, the first step toward longevity and eternal vision.\n\n*Burning harmony* means exhausting the primordial harmony. The *Zhuangzi·External Things* says: “With extreme worry, trapped in dual pitfalls with no escape, the cicada’s molting fails, the heart suspended between heaven and earth, restless and oppressed. Profit and harm grind against each other, generating excessive fire. The multitude burns harmony; the moon surely cannot withstand the fire. Thus, there is exhaustion, and the Dao is spent.”\n\nLu Fanghu says: “Those who cultivate truth and embody the Dao are empty, still, tranquil, and inactive. The fires of the five emotions are all subdued; profit and harm do not disturb the heart, and life and death do not alter the self. Those who do not know the Dao cannot endure worldly affairs, deeply worried and trapped in the dual pitfalls of profit and harm, with no escape. Restless and anxious, sitting uneasy, sleeping unsettled—this heart suspended between heaven and earth, restless and oppressed, cannot free itself. Profit and harm grind against each other, generating excessive fire, burning Heaven’s harmony. Thus, arise the afflictions of yin and yang. Not knowing the external cannot be relied upon, they engage in battle on the field of profit and harm, self-immolating like this. Therefore, the Daoist nurtures harmony, while the multitude burns harmony. *Burning* means scorching and searing. The character *moon* is uniquely placed—*moon* is water. Water cannot withstand fire, echoing the medical idea that one water cannot overcome five fires. Another interpretation: *moon* in ancient seal script is the character for *flesh*. The blood-formed body cannot withstand scorching and melting. Thus, there is exhaustion, and the Dao is spent.”",

      "translated_text": "\"Collapse\" signifies decline and death. The *Dao* here refers to the Way of life; when the Dao is exhausted, form and spirit perish with it. The intent is for people to still the heart’s fire through quietude, abiding in the realm of tranquility and non-action, fulfilling their natural lifespan without premature demise—this is the benevolence of saving the world.\n\nI note that Cao Wenyi’s *Song of the Great Dao* states:\n*\"Palaces and chambers lie empty, yet the spirit dwells within,\nThe soul’s crucible scorches, drying the blood and fluids.\nOne sorrow, one joy, one thought, one indulgence,\nOne exertion, one labor—each gnaws at the body’s form.\nDawn’s harm, dusk’s damage, deluded and unaware,\nSpirit scattered, vitality lost, with no place to rest.\nSubtly worn away, gradually withering,\nQi and harmony depleted, the spirit departs.\"*\n\nThis precisely serves as a gloss for Zhuangzi’s \"burning harmony.\"\n\nScholars practice the movement of returning and reversal, where heart and breath depend on the external—then the heart becomes empty. With the heart empty, fire does not flare upward, and the fluids of Wood do not wither: this is the inner nurturing of harmony. When heart and breath settle into emptiness, the true *qi* of Qian’s yang externally steams the four limbs, penetrating the entire body. In an instant, inner and outer yin and yang harmonize: this is the outer nurturing of harmony. When inner and outer mutually nurture each other, vitality flourishes daily, and the foundation of the undying Dao is established.\n\n---\n\n**133. Having Method and Having No Method**\n\nZhuangzi’s *Carving Intent* states:\n*\"Those who carve intent and exalt conduct, distancing themselves from the world and differing from common customs, indulging in lofty discourse and resentful slander, do so merely to be contentious—these are the scholars of mountains and valleys, not men of the world, those who favor withering away or plunging into the abyss (first type).\nThose who speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, practicing reverence, frugality, and yielding, do so merely to cultivate themselves—these are the scholars of peaceful eras, teachers and instructors, those who favor wandering and dwelling in learning (second type).\nThose who speak of great achievements, establishing great reputations, honoring ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior, do so merely to govern—these are the scholars of court and court, men who strengthen the state and achieve merit, those who favor annexation and consolidation (third type).\nThose who dwell in marshes and lakes, abide in leisure and openness, fishing and living idly, do so merely to be without action—these are the scholars of rivers and seas, recluses, those who favor leisure (fourth type).\nThose who practice breathing, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching, do so merely to prolong life—these are the practitioners of Dao-yin, those who nurture the body, those who favor the longevity of Peng Zu (fifth type).\nAs for those who are lofty without carving intent, cultivated without benevolence and righteousness, governed without merit and fame, at leisure without rivers and seas, long-lived without Dao-yin—nothing is forgotten, yet nothing is lacking. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow them: this is the Dao of heaven and earth, the virtue of the sage (sixth type).*\nThus it is said: *Serenity, stillness, silence, emptiness, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of heaven and earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue.*\nThus it is said: *The sage rests therein; rest leads to equanimity. Equanimity leads to serenity. Serene and equanimous, worries and misfortunes cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus, their virtue is whole, and their spirit is not diminished.\"*\n\nQiu Qiongshan said: *\"Those who delight in mountains and marshes go forth but cannot return. Those who serve in court enter but cannot exit. Those content with teaching are constrained and cannot extend. Those absorbed in nurturing the body preserve but cannot forget—this is not the true nature of things.\"*\n\nLu Xixing said: *\"Having enumerated the five types of men with methods, he reverts to the sagely man without method. 'Carving' means strict and exacting; 'exalting' means holding in high esteem. 'Resentment' is indignation; 'slander' is defamation. 'Withering away and plunging into the abyss' means willingly embracing solitude and casting oneself into deep mountains and remote valleys as if plunging into the depths. 'Cultivating' means refining the self. 'Nothing forgotten, nothing lacking' conveys the meaning of 'non-action yet nothing left undone.' 'Serene and boundless' means without limit.\"*\n\nI observe that the five types Zhuangzi enumerates all carve and refine their intent, pursuing their preferences, yet cannot forget the self or things, returning to the One without trace. As for those who embody the Dao, cultivating nature and reverting to virtue, their bodies merge with true emptiness, their actions leave no tracks—thus, serene and boundless, all excellences follow them. The terms *forgetting*, *resting*, *equanimity*, *serenity*, *emptiness*, and *non-action* all align with the Dao, revealing the wondrous subtleties of restoring nature.\n\nScholars, in practicing the interdependence of heart and breath, value attaining equilibrium. Equilibrium makes the breath harmonious and the heart at peace. Once spirit and breath are both forgotten, one enters samadhi with ease, forgetting both self and dharmas, merging subject and object, transcending existence and non-existence—this is the moment of serene boundlessness. At this time, the true yang of heaven and earth converges and returns. Silent yet responsive, still yet able to act, the more empty, the more abundant; the more forgotten, the more pure; the more pure, the more transformed—until the dharma-realm and the self are utterly without separation. This is called the Dao merging into oneness. Only when unified does the spirit become unfettered; unfettered, it has no method. Abiding in existence yet not attached to it, dwelling in non-existence yet not devoid of it, neither yin nor yang can constrain it, nor can the workings of creation fathom it—is this not the path of the perfected?\n\nThus it is said: *\"Nothing forgotten, yet nothing to forget; nothing possessed, yet nothing lacking. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow.\"* This is the wondrous subtlety of the forgotten heart, unattainable by those who carve intent and cultivate; the wondrous subtlety of no-method, unattainable by those whose attachments remain unbroken. Thus, the distinction between carving intent and forgetting intent, between having no method and having method, is the difference between the mind that abides and the mind that does not abide.\n\n**134.

      "translated_text": "From the *Zhuangzi*, \"The Dao of Heaven\" chapter:\nLong ago, Shun asked Yao, \"How does the Heavenly King employ his mind?\"\nYao replied, \"I do not scorn the friendless, nor abandon the destitute; I grieve for the dead, cherish the young, and pity women. This is how I employ my mind.\"\nShun said, \"Noble indeed, yet it is not great.\"\nYao asked, \"Then how should it be?\"\nShun said, \"Manifesting Heavenly virtue, one emerges in tranquility—sun and moon shine, the four seasons proceed, as day and night follow their constant course, clouds drift and rain falls.\"\nYao said, \"How entangled and troubled I am! You are in union with Heaven; I am in union with man. Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients held greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all esteemed. Thus, those who in ancient times ruled all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe \"Carving Intent\" chapter states: *\"Emptiness and tranquility accord with Heavenly virtue.\"* It also says: *\"The utmost in refinement and penetration unites with Heavenly principle.\"* Lu Xixing remarked: \"Manifesting Heavenly virtue to emerge in tranquility means governing by Heavenly virtue so that the myriad things are naturally at peace. Heaven’s virtue is non-action and spontaneity—thus the sun and moon shine of themselves, the four seasons proceed of themselves, day and night follow their constant course of themselves, clouds drift of themselves, and rain falls of themselves. Without intent toward things, the myriad things are naturally at peace. The movement of the Heavenly Dao accumulates nothing; the virtue of one who rules others is likewise. Truly, this is union with Heaven, not union with man.\"\n\nXuanjing said: Governing the state and governing the self follow the same principle. Heavenly virtue is the mind of Heaven. To unite with the mind of Heaven is to be empty and spontaneous, with the fire-phase purely of the prior-heaven, making return easy. To unite with the human mind is to generate intent and cling to forms, purely forced and contrary to spontaneity, step by step falling into the posterior-heaven, so that the effect of return is difficult to see. The phrase *\"manifesting Heavenly virtue to emerge in tranquility\"* is most wondrous: if one’s path accords with the mind of Heaven, then though one emerges, in stillness there is stability, in activity there is stability—within the four dignities, there is stability at all times. This is the meaning of *\"held by the Great Stability.\"*\n\nThus, emptiness and tranquility, the wondrous nature serene and unobstructed, quiescent illumination forgetting knowledge, acting without hindrance—though engaged in activity, one is not burdened by existence; though abiding in non-action, one does not drown in nothingness. Neither clinging to existence nor nothingness, nor dwelling in the mean, one may transcend and be at ease. Baozhenzi said: \"Now, man is indeed minute. What makes one a Heavenly immortal is that one’s mind is Heaven’s mind, and one must restore one’s original nature. Failing to restore one’s original nature, one drifts to the ends of emotion. Restoring nature is the way to Heaven; drifting in emotion is the way to man. As for man—you alone examine how the Master employed his mind: how much was it like man, and how much like Heaven? Abandon the human, approach the Heavenly. When the mind is wholly Heaven, this is how one becomes a true person. When man attains the true, one may speak of Heavenly immortals.\"\n\nXuanjing said: With emotion present, one is an ordinary person; with emotion forgotten, one is a sage-immortal. Forgetting emotion and extinguishing perceptions is the secret essential for turning the ordinary into the sagely. As for the practice, it lies solely in the single practice of harmonious samādhi. Mind and breath interdepend, and through extreme dependence, they transform. Breath has no exhalation or inhalation, thought has no arising or ceasing. Serenely entering samādhi, body and mind are both quiescent, inner and outer are forgotten together, person and dharma are both relinquished, principle and phenomenon are both extinguished, realm and wisdom are wondrously empty—this may be called abandoning the human and uniting with Heaven. One who unites with Heaven is of the same substance as the Great Void, of the same function as Heaven and Earth. Being of the same substance means the Dao is pervasively one; being of the same function means acting without intent. Master Miaozheng said: *\"Responding without intent, extinguishing illumination yet awareness is complete—unless one has reached the ultimate of the Dao, cast off the body, and has no dependence, one cannot easily speak of this.\"*\n\n**135. True Emptiness and Obdurate Emptiness**\n\nTrue emptiness and obdurate emptiness: one has creation, the other has no creation; one is perfect emptiness, the other is severed emptiness. Regarding practice, true emptiness means external breathing ceases, spirit and qi unite in stability, thought and念 are both extinguished, and nature and life become one. When extreme stillness moves, at the moment when the single yang returns, the wondrous manifests. Here, existence and nothingness are one, the wondrous aperture is the same mystery. Wuyuanzi said: *\"A bright moon in the sky illuminates the mind of Heaven; at midnight, thunder shakes the divine continent.\"* This accords with the wondrousness of true emptiness that is not empty. Thus, true emptiness fuses existence into emptiness, in the utmost nothingness contains the utmost existence—empty yet not empty, substance and function are one, the subtle and manifest are without gap. Here, there is inexhaustible life, boundless creation. The *Great Penetration Sutra*, \"True Emptiness\" chapter, states: *\"Born before Heaven, born yet without form; existing after Heaven, existing yet without substance. Yet without substance, it has never existed. Thus it is called inconceivable.\"* It also says: *\"Embracing the myriad images in its body, not clinging to a single thread.\"* And: *\"When mind is extinguished, nature appears, like space without form. Profoundly and perfectly full.\"*\n\nFuqiuweng said: *\"True emptiness is without self; greatly returning, greatly restoring, it is wholly one qi, returning to unite with the prior-heaven.\"* This is the wondrous purport of true emptiness. As for obdurate emptiness, it is the kind of biased stillness and sinking emptiness—dim and dull, merely suppressing thoughts from arising, the mind like still water. The ancients compared it to dead water that does not harbor dragons, and rightly so. What is called *\"the body like withered wood, the mind like dead ashes\"* is this. Thus, there is no life, no creation. The modern school of desiccated Chan precisely accords with this image.",
      "overlap_context": " nothing lacking. Serene and boundless, all excellences follow.\"* This is the wondrous subtlety of the forgotten heart, unattainable by those who carve intent and cultivate; the wondrous subtlety of no-method, unattainable by those whose attachments remain unbroken. Thus, the distinction between carving intent and forgetting intent, between having no method and having method, is the difference between the mind that abides and the mind that does not abide.\n\n**134.

      "translated_text": "The elixir method holds the single crucial technique of true emptiness—this is the orthodox transmission of the Zhong-Lü lineage. It requires entering the great samādhi of breathless stillness, where practice deepens until body and mind are utterly quiescent and unmoving. Both self and dharmas are relinquished, and the wondrous emptiness of realm and wisdom arises, within and without alike, forming the symbol ○. At this stage of practice, internally, one’s native earth manifests, the Five Phases and Four Images naturally unite, Kan and Li spontaneously merge, completing the work of the seven returns. Externally, the earth of Wu appears, the primordial qi of prior-heaven arrives unbidden, embracing my dharma-body and nurturing my physical form, bestowing benefits upon both form and dharma. Original yang daily grows, achieving the wondrous nine restorations. External restoration and internal return proceed simultaneously, bathing and sealing without need for arrangement.\n\nThus, Master Zhongli said: *\"The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. I too am a thing—therefore I probe its origin, gather its spirit, depart from being to return to non-being, reverting to true emptiness. To revert to true emptiness, one must first remove its hindrance.\"* Pure Yang said: *\"The wondrous treasure is refined not by chance; only when true emptiness is realized does one transcend.\"* Master Sanfeng said: *\"I await but to stir the fire and refine true emptiness, seeking light to shatter the primordial chaos.\"* And: *\"Only upon reaching the station of true emptiness does great function manifest—like the Dragon Girl offering a single precious pearl, golden light appears. Only then is it a gain forever secured.\"* And: *\"When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes; the dharma-body endures, never falling into emptiness.\"* And: *\"Circulate the samādhi fire of the celestial cycle, forging true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\"* And: *\"When the golden elixir is refined and true emptiness is realized, the body remains unmoving for a thousand years.\"*\n\nThis is the elixir formula of the Shaoyang and Wen-Shi lineages, both emphasizing the verification of true emptiness. Ancestor Chongyang said: *\"In empty space, reflect upon the scene of emptiness—illuminating true emptiness, emptiness is not empty.\"* And: *\"Within the tomb, the scene of true emptiness is ever present; awakening to emptiness upon emptiness, no dust arises.\"* And: *\"To perceive true emptiness, the primordial void is the ancestor.\"* Wang Yuyang said: *\"A single awakening to true emptiness completes the immortal.\"* Qiu Changchun’s *\"Song of the Great Void\"* states: *\"Chan as the lineage, Dao as the ancestor—shatter the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Radiant light interpenetrates, containing true emptiness; yet laugh at the one, two, three, four, five. Neither Dao nor Chan, merging with the profound and obscure, naturally so. Clearing the eye of purity for all things, the red emptiness shines boundlessly.\"*\n\nYu Qingfeng said: *\"Without reaching true emptiness, the yang spirit cannot emerge.\"* Master Baozhen said: *\"Only when true emptiness is without self can one transcend and transform the embryo.\"* Master Zhang said: *\"Seek the mysterious and wondrous to unite with true emptiness—when the affair of the void is complete.\"* This is the evidence of the Pure Yang lineage’s Northern School, which upholds true emptiness as paramount. In the preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, Master Ziyang wrote: *\"Yet the golden elixir arises from non-being—it must not be mistaken for obdurate emptiness. Know that this emptiness is true emptiness, non-being that is not devoid, thus true non-being.\"* Shi Xinglin’s *Returning to the Source* states: *\"Who knows the wondrous elixir formula? Throughout the day, refine true emptiness.\"* Chen Cuixu said: *\"When perfect and complete, within and without are one true emptiness.\"* Bai Yuchan said: *\"The cinnabar tripod of true emptiness is impartial; the crescent furnace of emptiness is spiritually penetrating.\"* And: *\"When Kan and Li are conjoined and the cycles of Gou and Fu harmonize, the life pulse of true emptiness is realized. The principle of heaven and earth, the spring wind of the myriad things—beyond yin and yang, the natural union of husband and wife—with a single touch, success is achieved.\"* Longmeizi said: *\"All conditioned things are unreal; awakening to the true source, emptiness is not empty.\"* This is clear evidence that the Pure Yang lineage’s Southern School also upholds true emptiness as essential.\n\nMaster Qianxu of the Eastern Ancestry composed *The Southern Florescence’s Supplementary Ink*, entirely expounding the wondrous discourse on true emptiness. Formerly, Master Wang instructed his inner disciples, also emphasizing true emptiness as the most crucial technique, calling it the mysterious pivot of elixir methods, the secret key of return, the path to perfection, and the swiftest route to enlightenment.\n\nYet, surveying ancient and modern elixir texts, those speaking of dragon-tiger, lead, and mercury are ubiquitous, while those revealing true emptiness are as rare as morning stars—why is this? Dongshan said: *\"Embodying true emptiness requires no forging.\"* Wan Hui said: *\"True emptiness does not destroy the nature of numinous wisdom; wondrous function is ever constant, without contrivance.\"* The *\"Heavenly Gate\"* passage in the *Zhuangzi*—*\"Exiting without root, entering without aperture, inherently substantial yet without location, inherently long yet without origin or end\"*—also illustrates the meaning of true emptiness.\n\nEmbodying true emptiness is the non-dual dharma-gate of Chan and the mysterious. Thus, Chen Nigan said: *\"Returning to the origin is true emptiness.\"* Ancestor Lü said: *\"The whole world seeks wondrous apertures—who in the space of emptiness attains the true meaning?\"* Considering the five ancestral texts: upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the wondrous aperture and the mysterious become one, being and non-being unite\"*—this grasps the essential principle of the *Daodejing*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the cosmos is in hand, the myriad transformations arise in the body\"*—this attains the dynamic function of the *Yinfu Jing*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"the three families naturally meet, the four images naturally converge, the five phases naturally gather\"*—this fulfills the talismanic treasure of the *Cantong Qi*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"true nature naturally reveals itself, delusive confusion naturally dissipates\"*—this ascends to the inner chamber of the *Wuzhen Pian*. Upon reaching true emptiness, *\"through stillness one responds, the qi of prior-heaven’s true unity arrives unbidden—no plowing or hoeing is needed, the great earth becomes gold\"*—this opens the treasure trove of the *Ruyao Jing*.",
      "overlap_context": "heaven.\"* This is the wondrous purport of true emptiness. As for obdurate emptiness, it is the kind of biased stillness and sinking emptiness—dim and dull, merely suppressing thoughts from arising, the mind like still water.

Holding the Rear to Whip the Rear**\n\nThe *Liezi*’s \"Explaining Symbols\" chapter states: \"Master Liezi studied under Hujiu Zilin. Hujiu Zilin said, ‘If you understand *holding the rear*, then we may speak of *holding the self*.’ Liezi replied, ‘I wish to hear about *holding the rear*.’ He said, ‘Observe your shadow, and you will know.’ Liezi turned and beheld his shadow: when the body was bent, the shadow was crooked; when the body was straight, the shadow was upright. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the body and do not lie in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on the self. This is called *holding the rear to abide in the forefront*.\"\n\nExplanation: Breath arises from the heart (the ancients, in creating the character for *breath* [息], made it from *self* [自] and *heart* [心], imbued with profound meaning). When breath is regulated, the heart is still; when the heart is agitated, breath is coarse; when the heart is calm, breath is fine. Breath and heart are like shadow and form. Thus, the interdependence of heart and breath is the secret of *holding the rear*. If one can hold the rear, one returns to the prior-heaven and abides in the prior-heaven—this is the wondrous Dao of the posterior-heaven returning to the prior-heaven.\n\nSome say: *Holding the rear to abide in the forefront* is the purport of the old sage’s teaching, *\"Putting the self last, one finds oneself first.\"* Thus, in the profound tradition’s cultivation, heart and breath externally interdepend to reach the state of true emptiness—this is the esoteric principle of *holding the rear to abide in the forefront*.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" chapter states: \"Tian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, ‘I have heard that Zhu Shen was a student of nurturing life. You have associated with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?’ Tian Kaizhi replied, ‘I merely sweep the courtyard with a broom—what could I have learned from the Master?’ The Duke said, ‘Master Tian, do not be modest. I wish to hear it.’ Kaizhi said, ‘I heard the Master say: *One who is good at nurturing life is like a shepherd—he watches those behind and whips them* (by whipping those behind, the ones ahead are pressed forward, and the flock moves steadily along).’ The Duke said, ‘What does this mean?’ Tian Kaizhi replied, ‘In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao who dwelt in the mountains and drank from streams, neither contending with others for profit. At seventy, he still had the complexion of an infant. Unfortunately, he encountered a starving tiger, which killed and devoured him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the wealthy and poor alike, yet at forty, he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger consumed his outer; Yi nurtured his outer, yet illness attacked his inner.’\"",

      "translated_text": "These two men both failed to whip those behind.’”\n\nThe commentary states: The Dao exists before Heaven, yet without relying on the postnatal physical form, one cannot advance in cultivation. Therefore, the wise preserve their bodies by not standing beneath crumbling walls, not treading perilous paths, not squandering their spirit to chase fame or seek praise. All profitless matters that harm body and mind are cast aside. Nurturing the inner to cultivate the self, guarding the outer to protect the body—only thus can the postnatal not burden the prenatal. *Laozi* says: “Which is dearer, fame or the self? Which is greater, the self or wealth?” It also says: “Why would the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his body as light when weighed against the world?” Both express this principle. Master Shao said: “If asked about the prenatal, not a word exists; only in the postnatal must one apply effort.” This too conveys the meaning of whipping those behind. By diligently tending to what follows, one may transcend what precedes. This is the intent of *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* in “whipping the rear” and “holding to the rear”—it embodies the profound meaning of refining the true through the provisional. We ought to pay heed.\n\n---\n\n**137. Mutual Propulsion and Mutual Overcoming**\n*The Book of Changes* elucidates how yin and yang mutually propel one another to generate creation. As it says: “When the sun departs, the moon arrives; when the moon departs, the sun arrives—sun and moon mutually propel one another, and brightness arises. When cold departs, heat arrives; when heat departs, cold arrives—cold and heat mutually propel one another, and the year is completed.” It also says: “Hard and soft mutually propel one another to produce change.” All these are examples. The final section of *The Classic of Yin Conformity* clarifies how yin and yang mutually overcome one another to return to the unknowable true emptiness of yin and yang. Thus it says: “The art of yin and yang mutually overcoming is luminously manifest, advancing beyond images.” This reveals how yin and yang, in mutual containment, both perish—neither existence nor nonexistence, neither brightness nor darkness, neither arising nor ceasing—precisely the wondrous principle of transcending duality through opposition. Mutual propulsion follows the natural course; mutual overcoming reverses it. Mutual propulsion creates duality—this is the Dao of the *Changes*. Mutual overcoming dissolves duality—this is the Dao of the Elixir. Mutual propulsion entails sequence; mutual overcoming occurs simultaneously. Heart and breath interdependent, nature and life united—this is the image of mutual overcoming.\n\n---\n\n**138. Ancient Origin and Doubtful Origin**\n*Laozi* says: “Meet it, yet you do not see its beginning; follow it, yet you do not see its end. Grasp the ancient Dao to steer the present being. To know the ancient origin is called the discipline of the Dao.” *Zhuangzi* says: “From singing I heard of the Dark and Vast; from the Dark and Vast I heard of the Threefold Void; from the Threefold Void I heard of the Doubtful Origin.”\n\nThe commentary states: The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. Though called an origin, it is in truth without beginning or end. Hence it is said: “Meet it, yet you do not see its beginning; follow it, yet you do not see its end.” This is the true emptiness of the Limitless, the source of the Great Dao, the root of nature and life. In cultivation, to unite with the ancient origin is to awaken obscurely to the original awakening. The Doubtful Origin, though without origin, differs in name from the Ancient Origin but shares the same meaning.\n\n---\n\n**139. Inner and Outer Restraint**\n*Zhuangzi*’s “Gengsang Chu” chapter says: “Those who are outwardly restrained (韄, pronounced *huò*, meaning bound) cannot be seized with haste, for they will turn inward to close themselves off. Those who are inwardly restrained cannot be seized with entanglement, for they will turn outward to close themselves off. Those who are both inwardly and outwardly restrained—even the power of virtue cannot sustain them, let alone those who abandon the Dao and act recklessly!”\n\nLu Xixing says: “In learning, the essential point lies in forgetting both inner and outer restraints entirely. When one is fettered within, it is called inner restraint; when fettered without, it is called outer restraint. *Huò* refers to binding things with leather. The human heart should be empty, still, and tranquil. If, upon encountering things, it cannot pass beyond without lingering, it is seized by grasping and taking—thus the heart is bound by outer restraint. Seeking the original substance amid this restless disturbance is like an object resisting within: the inner is already full, so it closes inward and does not open. If one moves with desire and cannot flow with transformation, thoughts churn ceaselessly—the heart is bound by inner restraint. Seeking the original substance amid this entanglement is like having already been touched by sensation: external conditions are hard to sever, so it closes outward and is difficult to release. *Zhuo* means to seek; *jian* (pronounced *jié*) means to fasten securely. Such newly coined expressions are like clouds drifting beyond the sunset—certainly not something those who consume cooked food could articulate. ‘Those who are both inwardly and outwardly restrained—even the power of virtue cannot sustain them’ means that when inner and outer are both fettered, even those who possess virtue cannot maintain themselves, let alone those who follow the Dao. To possess virtue is to have cleansed oneself thoroughly, naturally free from restraint—this is likely a hypothetical statement.”\n\nXuanjing says: The above explanations of principle are already quite clear. In sum, outer restraint means circumstances that melt the heart; inner restraint means the heart that clings to circumstances. When the dust of circumstances is empty, outer restraint dissolves; when the mind’s perceptions are forgotten, inner restraint vanishes. Only when both heart and circumstances are forgotten do inner and outer become empty together, and wisdom shines forth. In the cultivation and realization of the Mystery School, one first empties body and mind, then simultaneously liberates inner and outer roots and dust. The work must proceed through the interdependence of heart and breath, gradually entering realization. Once great samadhi is constant, inner and outer naturally merge, and principle cannot restrain what is restrained or close what is closed. As Li Daochun said: “When the heart is still, one realizes non-arising.”\n\n---\n\n**140. Preserving Radiance and Preserving the True**\n*Zhuangzi*’s “Equalizing Things” chapter says: “Pour into it, yet it is never full; draw from it, yet it never runs dry. Yet you do not know its source—this is called preserving radiance.”",

      "translated_text": "**140. Preserving Radiance and Preserving the True (continued)**\n\nThe *Tian Zifang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* states: “In his person, he is true—human in appearance yet empty by nature, following conditions while preserving the true, pure yet accommodating all things. When things lack the Dao, he responds with upright bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions.”\n\nThe commentary explains: *Preserving radiance* means veiling one’s light, akin to the *Book of Changes* image of “brightness entering the earth.” The *Cantong Qi* says: “The origin lies hidden in illumination; within, it illumines the body.” This is the essence of preserving radiance.\n\nThe oral instruction states: Turn the light inward and reflect; conceal the spirit in emptiness. Regulate the breath to be continuous, gradually condensing and settling until the breath has no exit or entry, and inner and outer attain stillness. Entering the realm of great quiescence, one returns to nothingness—unaware, unknowing, without self or other. This is called *concealing the esoteric*, also known as *preserving radiance*. To know preserving radiance is to know preserving the true.\n\nThe *true* is the true nature. Nurtured by samadhi and wisdom, it shines forth anew each day. Lu Xixing said: “*Following emptily* means emptying the self to accord with conditions. *Preserving the true* means nurturing the true through emptiness and stillness.” When heart and breath interdepend to enter great samadhi, and inner and outer harmonize, this is the unified practice of preserving the true and preserving radiance.\n\n---\n\n**141. Cultivating Nature and Cultivating Life**\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*“To cultivate nature alone, neglecting life—\nThis is the foremost malady in cultivation.\nTo refine only the ancestral nature, not the elixir,\nFor ten thousand kalpas, the yin spirit struggles to attain sagehood.\nThose who grasp the life-school yet lose the ancestral nature\nResemble a mirror without its precious backing—\nA fool whose lifespan matches heaven and earth,\nHolding the family wealth yet lacking the master’s authority.”*\n\nThis song, framed in the duality of Daoist nature and life, urges their mutual completion—right and proper. Yet if scholars cling to this to misrepresent Buddhist cultivation, dismissing it as ignorant of the life-school and confined to the yin spirit’s realm, they commit a grave error.\n\nFor Daoism speaks of *nature* in terms of its relation to life, spirit to qi, true emptiness to wondrous existence—always in duality. Buddhism speaks of *nature* as transcending life and death, spirit and qi, existence and non-existence, sentience and insentience. The *wondrous luminous true nature* is the absolute true, not a relative entity. How can one critique Buddhism’s realm prior to the Aeon of Thunderous Silence using the standards of the Mystery School?\n\n**Question:** Then does the Buddha’s *intent-born body* also belong to the yang spirit?\n**Answer:** One who realizes the Dharma-body of self-nature transcends all dualities of yin and yang, light and dark. The *Book of Changes* says: “What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called *spirit*.” The Buddha’s Dharma-body is pure, all-pervading, subtle, and all-embracing—beyond conjecture or measure. To gauge the Buddha’s intent-born body by the yardstick of yin and yang is to fall forever short. Only when the scholar’s emotional measures are utterly dissolved, and suchness is directly realized, can one attain even a fraction of correspondence.\n\n---\n\n**142. Yin Spirit and Yang Spirit**\n\nThe *yin spirit* is the projected consciousness prior to the complete dissolution of the five aggregates. The *yang spirit* is the intent-born body manifest after the five aggregates are fully dissolved.\n\nThe distinction between yin and yang hinges solely on whether the five aggregates are dissolved—not on the presence or absence of form or sound. Foxes, deer, and other spirits in deep mountains that assume human form are but transformations of refined essence—how could they be called yang spirits?\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, in its section on dissolving the five aggregates, states: “When the mind departs the body and reflects upon its own face, coming and going freely without obstruction, this is called the exhaustion of the *receptivity aggregate*.” It further says: “When the receptivity aggregate is exhausted, though outflows may not yet be fully extinguished, the mind leaves the body like a bird freed from its cage. From this mortal form, one ascends through the sixty sacred stages of bodhisattvahood, attaining the intent-born body, dwelling without hindrance.”\n\nHere, the *Śūraṅgama* is perfectly clear: only when the *form* and *receptivity* aggregates are both dissolved can the body depart its form and move freely. Yet if the *conception*, *volition*, and *consciousness* aggregates remain unbroken, lacking supernatural transformation and the ability to benefit beings, what emerges is the yin spirit. Advancing further through the sixty sacred stages of bodhisattvahood, one attains the intent-born body—equivalent to the Daoist *true person*.\n\nThe *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* states: “The bodhisattva-mahāsattva’s intent-born body, through the power of the *illusion-like samādhi*, manifests supernatural mastery, conjuring adorned sacred forms of all kinds simultaneously, without obstruction.” It further says: “Having entered the *Immovable Ground*, with boundless samādhi at will, one attains the intent-born body, the *illusion-like samādhi*, and ultimate mastery of power and wisdom, freely aiding and benefiting all beings.”\n\nHere, it is made clear that only with the intent-born body, through the power of samādhi, can one manifest wondrous adornments, myriad supernatural abilities, and instantaneous fulfillment of intent—unobstructed and free. This differs from the *Śūraṅgama*’s “mind departing the body.”\n\nOnly when the *consciousness aggregate* is dissolved does the dawn of nirvana arise, and the self-nature’s spiritual function manifest, enabling the attainment of this body. According to the *Laṅkāvatāra*, there are three kinds of intent-born bodies:\n\n1. **The Intent-Born Body of Samādhi-Joy and Right Absorption**: When the three [samādhis] are fully ripened, the Dharma-body gains unfettered mastery, appearing and vanishing at will. With samādhi’s right absorption as the root of the perfected Dao-embryo, it is called the *intent-born body of samādhi-joy and right absorption*.\n\n2. **The Intent-Born Body of Awakened Dharma-Nature**: For bodhisattvas from the eighth stage onward, who penetrate all dharmas as self-nature’s manifestations, attaining mastery over mind and dharma, this body manifests countless Dharma-body forms, replete with adornments, pervading all buddha-lands without obstruction. It is called the *intent-born body of awakened dharma-nature*.",

      "translated_text": "3. **The Intent-Born Body of Species-Coemergence and Non-Action**: For bodhisattvas at the stage of Equal Awakening, with the vajra-mind, they sever the subtlest ignorance of the arising mark of existence. Once the flowing stream of birth-and-death is exhausted, they can manifest a thousand kinds of bodies across ten thousand species, responding to all without exception—yet without action, without effort, without mind, without conditions. This is called the *intent-born body of species-coemergence and non-action*. Among the three, this is the most transcendent.\n\nIn the profound school, when the Dao-embryo is perfected in the tenth month, the true person manifests in form, having already attained the first kind of intent-born body. By the time the three-year nurturing of the One is complete, they can divide their body into countless forms, entering the second kind of intent-born body. Finally, upon returning to the origin and completing the Dao, they enter the third kind of intent-born body.\n\n*The Record of Marvelous Encounters in the Sea and Mountains* states: \"Yao Pingzhong of the Southern School, while on Mount Damian, encountered the two patriarchs Zhong and Lü. The patriarchs instructed him to cultivate in stillness within a mountain cave. After eighty-one days, he could project his spirit, transform at will, and know past and future, believing he had attained realization. The patriarchs returned and said, ‘This is but a yin-spirit; it cannot endure long. You must obtain the golden fluid—this is the yang elixir.’ Lüzu then revealed to him the secret of the ninefold return. Pingzhong thereafter concealed his traces, cultivated diligently, accumulated merit and practice, and ultimately achieved the great Dao.\"\n\nNote that Pingzhong’s initial projection of the yin-spirit corresponds to what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* describes as \"the mind leaving the body to observe its own face\"—this is not an intent-born body.\n\nWhen the First Patriarch Bodhidharma entered quiescence, he was buried on Mount Xiong’er. Later, during the Wei dynasty, Song Yun, returning from a mission to the Western Regions, encountered the master on the Congling Mountains. He saw him walking alone, carrying a single sandal. Yun asked, \"Where are you going?\" The master replied, \"To the Western Heaven.\" He further told Yun, \"Your lord has already departed the world.\" Yun, bewildered, parted ways with the master and continued eastward. Upon returning to report his mission, he found that Emperor Ming had already passed away. When Emperor Xiaozhuang ascended the throne, Yun reported the matter in full. The emperor ordered the tomb opened, but only an empty coffin was found, with a single leather sandal remaining. (*Biographies of Divine Monks*, fascicle four)\n\nObserve that what Bodhidharma manifested was an intent-born body. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, in its \"Ten Grounds\" chapter, expounds the vast and wondrous realm of the intent-born body—this may be consulted for reference.\n\n---\n\n**The Mechanisms of Killing and Stealing**\nThe upper section of the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* reveals the subtlety of the *killing mechanism*, while the middle section elucidates the principle of the *stealing mechanism*. Both the killing and stealing mechanisms operate through inversion—secret essentials for reversing the flow of life’s momentum and returning to the origin.\n\nThe text states:\n> When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift and constellations alter;\n> When Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land;\n> When humans unleash their killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth overturn;\n> When Heaven and humans jointly unleash it, the myriad transformations are stabilized at their foundation.\n\nThe nature of reality is without birth or extinction, yet what appears as birth and extinction is qi, not nature. Master Qianxu said, \"Nature is originally unborn; it rides the momentum of qi to manifest birth.\" Thus, the key to reversing the flow lies in the interdependence of heart and breath—from having breath, one enters breathlessness; from having thoughts, one enters thoughtlessness. When breath and thought are both dissolved, true emptiness fully manifests. Then, the roots and dust no longer pair, the mind and consciousness are utterly extinguished, and the original nature shines forth, revealing the great function.\n\nThis aligns with what Lüzu called \"having already given birth, then killing life.\" Here, the dependent and the proper revolve and transform, the myriad transformations are stabilized at their foundation, one instantly transcends the leaky, the bonds of the five aggregates are shattered, and the three virtues are perfectly realized—is this not the subtlety of the killing mechanism?\n\nThus, by revolving birth-and-extinction into quiescent extinction, body and mind remain unmoved, embracing Heaven and Earth. The Buddhist school speaks of \"breaking the clouds to turn,\" while the profound school speaks of \"the killing mechanism\"—their meaning is one.\n\nMaster Hanxu’s *Categorized Explanation of the Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* states:\n> The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says, \"The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.\" That yin precedes and yang follows reflects the principle of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things: without stillness, there is no arising of movement; thus, *Bo* (\"Splitting Apart\") precedes *Fu* (\"Return\"). The *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* in one fascicle is the pivot of yin-yang interpenetration. Here, the divine is extinguished in the divine, and the non-divine is born in the divine. This is where the hidden and manifest of life and emergence reside; the gate through which inversion and return pass; the convergence of the waxing and waning of the sun and moon; the path of the coming and going of the great and small; the root of the control of death and life; the ground where kindness and harm ride upon each other; the realm of the advance and retreat of water and fire.",

      "translated_text": "The passage from the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* still speaks of the workings of a single qi. This void and nonexistent qi, when attained, gives life; when lost, brings death. Infants can unite heart and breath, so their respiratory mechanism gathers the true yang of Heaven and Earth. Once the passions awaken and desires arise, the breath becomes short and shallow—more is exhaled than inhaled. The primordial qi within the body, through this respiratory mechanism, returns once more to the void. This is what is meant by \"Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life\" (in truth, one gives life to oneself and kills oneself).\n\nThe marvel of the immortals' return lies in responding through stillness. Thus, heart and breath depend on each other externally, allowing spirit and breath to settle and body and mind to enter stillness. By uniting the void of one’s body with the void of Heaven and Earth, one naturally reverses the qi mechanism. Then, the primordial yang of Heaven and Earth comes unbidden and arrives unsought. What was once taken from the body is returned to it, and things return to their original master. Though crudely called the \"mechanism of thievery,\" it is in fact the return to the original source, the inheritance of one’s ancestral legacy.\n\nWhen the practitioner’s cultivation reaches the emptiness of the fundamental substance, where roots and dust are both extinguished and self and other are no longer established, the entire dharma realm manifests in purity and fullness throughout the body. How then could one speak of thievery or the stolen? This is what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls \"the unconditioned true suchness, where the nature is pure and luminously revealed.\"\n\nOne must understand that the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* sets humanity and Heaven in opposition, hence the distinction between the thief and the stolen. As long as the view of subject and object remains uneliminated and the attachment to self and other is not dissolved, one has not entered the gate of non-duality or attained the function of oneness. But when the nature merges with true emptiness and the singular true is revealed alone, then mountains, rivers, and the great earth fully manifest as the body of the Dharma King. One realizes that Heaven and Earth share the same root as the self, and the myriad things are one with the self. This is what *Zhuangzi* calls \"the Dao pervading the one.\" Here, the view of subject and object is extinguished, and the attachment to self and other is dissolved.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under Heaven.\" Responding through stillness, heart and environment merge, self and other are no longer separate—this is the discourse of seeing the truth. The \"mechanism of thievery\" in the *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* is nothing more than the function of stillness and response. In conventional terms, it provisionally illustrates the principle of theft and seizure, but it is not ultimate. Practitioners must not cling to it.\n\nThe *Lotus Sūtra* describes the young child turning back to recognize the father and thereby inheriting the family legacy. When we cultivate the Dao, quieting the heart and stilling thoughts, emptying body and mind, and dissolving views and attachments, we reach the state of oneness where self and other are not separate and things and self are merged. This, too, is the inheritance of one’s original family legacy, not theft or seizure.\n\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: \"Cultivating the nature returns to virtue; when virtue is perfected, it is one with the beginning. Oneness is emptiness, and emptiness is vastness.\" He also says: \"The great one pervades it.\" Such discourse aligns with the fundamental principles of Daoism and harmonizes with Confucianism and Buddhism, perfectly uniting with the gate of non-duality.\n\n---\n\n**Heavenly Mechanism and Spiritual Mechanism**\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Those whose desires are deep have shallow heavenly mechanisms.\" Chen Cuixu says: \"Seize the marvel of the heavenly mechanism, and at midnight, observe the Dipper’s handle.\" He also says: \"Seizing the true workings of the heavenly mechanism, within the body lies the Jade Pure Heaven.\" And again: \"It is precisely because the heavenly mechanism is simple and wondrous that it is scattered throughout the alchemical texts yet never revealed.\"\n\nChen Baoyi says: \"If one does not intentionally seek lead and mercury, how can one awaken to the heavenly mechanism and congeal the sacred embryo?\" Lü Zu says: \"The heavenly mechanism runs deep, deeper still—mere talk of ten thousand kalpas or a thousand pieces of gold is futile.\" Ge Xianweng says: \"The Jade Liquid irrigates, the Cavern Chamber’s tassels flow. The heavenly mechanism is openly revealed, and the myriad sounds cannot compare.\" These are the teachings on the heavenly mechanism.\n\nThe *Classic of Uniting with the Hidden* states: \"There is a wondrous device from which the ten thousand images arise. The Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle conceal the spiritual mechanism like ghosts.\" Chen Momo says: \"The two numinous medicines naturally unite; the subtle spiritual mechanism is sought here.\" Zhang Sanfeng says: \"Use the spiritual mechanism to subtly align with the celestial cycle, guarding body and mind against danger and peril.\" Li Qing’an says: \"That which abides within is spirit; that which issues forth is mechanism. Still and unmoving is spirit; responsive and penetrating is mechanism. Hidden and unfathomable is spirit; adaptable and boundless is mechanism. Encompassed within the body is spirit; extended to the myriad things is mechanism.\" These are the teachings on the spiritual mechanism.\n\nXuanjing says: The heavenly mechanism is the single, supremely numinous qi of the primordial. This is what Confucius called \"the heart of Heaven and Earth,\" and what Master Zhou’s *Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate* called \"the true of the Ultimate of Non-being.\" The spiritual mechanism is the wondrous, natural workings of transformation within the dim and obscure, the alchemical timing.\n\nThe \"wondrous device\" refers to the external Mysterious Pass. Those whose desires run deep lose more primordial qi, their primordial essence flows away, and their primordial yang grows dimmer by the day. Hence, it is said that \"the heavenly mechanism is shallow.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The ancients said the heavenly mechanism must not be leaked. Now you openly reveal the marvels of the Dao—are you not leaking the heavenly mechanism?\" Xuanjing replied: \"You take oral instructions to be the heavenly mechanism, but this is not true knowledge of it. When the practitioner’s effort reaches the extreme of emptiness and the utmost stillness, the primordial chaos is about to separate, and the single numinous yang of the primordial emerges from the void like dew or lightning. This is the heavenly mechanism openly revealed. One must swiftly turn the Mysterious Pass and secretly store this single numinous yang, preventing its further leakage—this is called 'gathering the medicine and returning to the pot.' What must not be leaked is the instruction to send it back to the earthen cauldron and seal it firmly.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Yinfu Jing*, though not authored by the Yellow Emperor, is an ancient Daoist text. Its *Upper Scroll* states: “Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism.” Its *Lower Scroll* states: “The mechanism lies in the eye.” This principle of the mechanism of the mind and the mechanism of the eye was once expounded by my master, Body-of-Truth Mountain Man, who said:\n\n“The mechanism is the pivot of movement and stillness. The scripture says: ‘Where the eye reaches, the mind reaches also. Yet where the mind reaches, the eye reaches also.’ Another scripture says: ‘If the eye does not move, the mind abides; if the mind does not move, the eye also abides.’ This mechanism, when external, is the eye; when internal, it is the mind. One must know that mind and breath are interdependent—when this interdependence reaches the point where breathing ceases, one attains perfect serenity and great stillness. As Ancestor Lü said: ‘Learn death before you die.’ The interdependence of mind and breath is the method of learning death. To learn death is to make the mind die. Once the mind is dead, the eye too will not move. One must know that when the eyelids do not move, it is because the interdependence of mind and breath has reached its ultimate state. Thus it is said: ‘The mechanism lies in the eye.’”\n\nThis may be called an elucidation of what has never been elucidated through the ages—it is perfect, complete, and beyond further addition.\n\n---\n\n**146. The Mechanism of Return and the Mechanism of Cessation**\n\nFrom delusion to awakening is called *return*; to revert to the root and return to the source is also called *return*. Since the beginningless beginning, I have transmigrated through kalpas, solely because I turned away from awakening and merged with dust, following things as they turned—like a prodigal son wandering to the ends of the earth, forgetting how to return home and recognize his father, to inherit the family estate. Now, suddenly awakening to past errors, I abruptly change course, devote myself to the study of nature and life, and through realizing nature, restore life. This single thought of turning the mind is called *initial awakening*. With the pure mind of initial awakening, one reflects inward into the *qi*-cavern, calming and stilling it to merge with the breath. Over time, spirit congeals and breath abides; effortlessly, one enters samadhi. Over time, one becomes profoundly still, the six senses utterly empty, a single thought of non-doing, cutting off the ten directions—this is called the *mechanism of cessation*. The mechanism of cessation is the forgetting of mechanism. An ancient worthy said: “Forgetting mechanism exalts the Buddha Way.” Little does one know that the immortal’s path also values the forgetting of mechanism—forgetting form, forgetting things, forgetting *qi*, forgetting spirit, forgetting illumination, forgetting knowledge—all returning to primordial chaos. The more one forgets, the more numinous one becomes, until both person and dharma are empty, both mind and realm are quiescent. Quiescence upon quiescence—then the sacred embryo is perfected, and the Dao transcends all images.\n\nAncestor Lü said:\n*“Sitting or lying, forgetting mechanism, the sword’s shadow stands alone—*\n*One point of numinous essence merges with the elixir furnace.”*\nHe also said:\n*“Pine winds intoxicate me, twofold forgetting of mechanism—*\n*Carving cloud-root, barely half a span.”*\nAnd again:\n*“Ceasing thoughts, forgetting mechanism, merging with spontaneity.”*\nAll these are the wondrous principles of the mechanism of cessation.\n\n---\n\n**147. Possessing Conditions and Possessing Virtue**\n\n*Conditions* refer to the circumstances for cultivating the Dao. The Mysterious School holds that the four—method, wealth, companions, and place—must be complete before the Daoist enterprise can be accomplished. The Tiantai School’s *Zhiguan* requires the possession of five conditions. What are these five?\n1. Sufficient clothing and food;\n2. Pure observance of precepts;\n3. Secluded and quiet dwelling;\n4. Cessation of all conditioned affairs;\n5. Proximity to a good spiritual guide.\n\nThe so-called *conditioned affairs* are further divided into four kinds: livelihood affairs, social obligations, skill and learning affairs—all of which should be relinquished. Moreover, *good spiritual guides* are of three types: external protectors, fellow practitioners, and teaching masters. This aligns perfectly with the Mysterious School’s fourfold requirement of method, wealth, companions, and place.\n\nHowever, even if conditions are met but virtue is lacking, various demonic obstacles will arise, hindering the practitioner’s progress, and the Daoist enterprise may still be difficult to accomplish. Thus, possessing virtue is even more urgent than possessing conditions. As *Zhuangzi* said: “Virtue is the cultivation of harmony and completion.” Perfected One Hidden-in-Void said: “In the external elixir’s path, initiation depends on the person, completion on Heaven, knowledge on wisdom, congealment on blessing, transmission on the master, and clarity on the eye—none of which can be borrowed from others even by a hair’s breadth. If one can cultivate virtue in seclusion, secretly unite like-minded companions, move Heaven and Earth with virtue, and move ghosts and spirits with sincerity, then when approaching the furnace, one can be assured of no mishaps. Otherwise, even with correct methods and a clear mind and eye, how can one withstand demonic trials? I have personally tested and verified this; now I dare not conceal it.” Though this refers to the cultivation of the earthly elixir, the human elixir’s method is no exception.\n\nThus, the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n*“The great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—*\n*Know that it depends on me and also on Heaven.*\n*If one has not accumulated deeds and bestowed hidden virtue,*\n*At every turn, hordes of demons will create obstructive conditions.”*\n\nPerfected One Hidden-in-Void’s *Preface to the Wuzhen Pian* states: “Hidden virtue is what others do not know. Master Upper Yang’s *Record* says: giving without seeking repayment is hidden virtue; accumulating good without others knowing, not pushing others into danger, secretly doing acts of kindness—all are hidden virtue. The scripture says: ‘When misfortune comes to them, I return with blessing; when resentment comes to them, I return with virtue.’ Immortal Master Hao the Ancient said: ‘Manifest virtue subdues people; hidden virtue subdues demons.’”\n\nI say: *Baopuzi* states: “The immortal’s method desires love to extend to the lowly and the wriggling, not harming any breathing being. The immortal’s method desires love to pervade the eight wilds, seeing others as oneself.” It also says: “Someone asked: Should those who cultivate the Dao first establish merit and virtue? Is this correct? *Baopuzi* replied: Yes. According to the *Jade Bell Scripture*: ‘Establishing merit is foremost; eliminating transgressions is secondary.’ For those who cultivate the Dao, saving people from danger, enabling them to avoid calamity, protecting them from illness, preventing them from dying unjustly—these are the highest merits.”",

How then can one doubt Niquan’s words?\"\n\n145. The Mechanism of the Mind and the Mechanism of the Eye.",

      "translated_text": "Those who seek immortality must take loyalty, filial piety, harmony, and compliance as their foundation, with benevolence and trustworthiness as their root. If one does not cultivate virtue but merely pursues techniques, one will not attain longevity.” It also states: “I further suspect that those like Master Peng have not accumulated sufficient merit, and thus cannot ascend to heaven.” This precisely reveals the essentials of possessing virtue. Daoist adepts of the Mysterious School who wish to realize the truth in this very body must first transform their minds, constantly harboring thoughts of benefiting others—bestowing great joy with compassion, and relieving suffering with great mercy—practicing expedient means at all times and broadly accumulating good affinities. Then, those who have not yet met a teacher will meet one, and those who have already met a teacher will attain the Dao. Laozi said: “The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality; it always aligns with the good.” This is what it means.\n\n**148. Equanimity and Calming the Breath**\nMaster Sengchan’s *Inscription on Faith in Mind* states: “One kind of equanimity—all distinctions vanish of themselves.” When Chan Master Liaoshan Gaoyao re-visited Master Boshan, Boshan asked: “After years away, what have you gained?” Gaoyao replied: “Only equanimity.” These two words, “equanimity,” are profoundly subtle yet not easily attained. For unless one reaches the state where wisdom and circumstances merge, where self and others become one, one cannot grasp it. Beginners in the Dao, unable to forget circumstances, how can they achieve equanimity? If equanimity is not yet attainable, first calm the breath. Calming the breath means the mind and breath interdepend, refined to purity, even and gentle, continuous and unbroken. When the breath is calm, the mind is also calm! If, in the midst of intense anger, one can instantly turn the light inward and, within three to five breaths, enter the state of profound obscurity, this gradually aligns with the principle of equanimity. *Zhuangzi* says: “Rest in the harmony of Heaven,” illustrating the subtlety of equanimity. Master Huzǐ’s “balancing the qi mechanism” reveals the subtlety of calming the breath. “Harmony” means balance; “balance” also means equilibrium—the state of undifferentiated chaos without inner or outer.\n\n**149. Peaceful Dwelling and Peace of Mind**\n*Mozi* said: “It is not that there is no peaceful dwelling, but no peace of mind; not that there is no sufficient wealth, but no contentment of heart.” Upon reading this, I could not help but exclaim in delight: How closely his words resemble those of the Old Master! Laozi said: “Knowing contentment brings no disgrace; knowing when to stop brings no danger.” He also said: “No sin is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than not knowing contentment; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is everlasting contentment.” This can mutually elucidate *Mozi*’s words. As for the method of peace of mind, it is universally esteemed by the Three Teachings. Regulating the breath and concentrating the spirit, stilling both body and mind, dwelling in tranquility and emptiness—what *Zhuangzi* calls “letting the mind wander in the origin of things”—is the method of peace of mind in the Mysterious School. The *Book of Changes* says: “The sage uses this to cleanse the mind and retreat into secrecy.” Yangzi said: “Conceal the mind in the abyss to beautify its spiritual root.” This is the Confucian method of peace of mind. The Second Patriarch Huike said to Bodhidharma: “My mind is not at peace; I beg you, Master, to pacify it.” Bodhidharma replied: “Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it.” After a long while, Huike said: “I have searched for the mind but cannot find it.” Bodhidharma said: “I have pacified your mind.” This is the Chan method of peace of mind. Chan is the most transcendent, yet not something beginners can suddenly grasp. Only those who have seen the Buddha as if face-to-face can attain the emptiness of mind. Seeking a method that is simple, accessible, and universally applicable to all roots, none surpasses the Old Master’s method of peace of mind—concentrating the spirit in emptiness and harmonizing it with the breath. When the breath is regulated, the mind becomes still; with prolonged stillness, one naturally enters samadhi. In this samadhi, body and mind become light and at ease, the hundred bones are harmonized, worldly burdens gradually dissolve, and wisdom daily increases. Thus, *Liezi* says: “Nothing surpasses stillness; nothing surpasses emptiness. Stillness and emptiness—these are where one abides. Grasping and giving—these are what one loses.” This is the essential principle of the Mysterious School’s Complete Reality, the ultimate key to returning to life.\n\n**150. Perceiving the Unique and Doubting the Unique**\n*Zhuangzi* said: “Only after perceiving the Unique can one transcend past and present; only by transcending past and present can one enter the realm of neither death nor life.” *Liezi* said: “Those who do not arise doubt the Unique; those who do not transform cycle between going and returning. The boundary of going and returning cannot be exhausted; the Dao of doubting the Unique cannot be fathomed.” Explanation: The Dharma-eye of the mind-ground, able to perceive the Dharma-body, is called perceiving the Unique. The Unique is the truth without dependence. The Dharma-nature is non-dual and does not accompany the myriad dharmas, hence it is called Unique. Hanshanzi said: “Precious is the natural thing, standing alone without companions.” *Laozi* said: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Silent and empty, it stands alone and does not change, circulating without end.” All these illustrate the meaning of non-dependence, hence it is called the body of absolute truth. All phenomena of life and death, day and night, light and dark, form and emptiness belong to duality. Perceiving the Unique transcends the two extremes, merging into oneness, thus enabling one to transcend past and present and enter the realm of neither death nor life. The “doubt” in doubting the Unique shares the same meaning as the “doubt” in *Zhuangzi*’s “doubting the beginning.” It means using true nature to encompass all dharmas, uniting root and branches in the source, yet the source itself is not established. Thus, neither the Unique nor the non-Unique need be clung to. This means that even the perception of the Unique is cast off, not lingering on the Dharma-body. Profound indeed!\n\n**151. Seeing Simplicity and Embodying Simplicity**\n*Laozi* said: “See simplicity and embrace the uncarved block.” *Zhuangzi* said: “Simplicity means having nothing mixed with it.”",

      "translated_text": "\"Purity\" means its spirit remains unblemished; \"to embody purity and simplicity\" is called the *zhenren* (True Person).\" Nan Yue Huai Chan Master said: \"Cultivation and realization are not absent, yet defilement cannot reach it.\" The Sixth Patriarch affirmed this, saying: \"This very non-defilement is what all buddhas cherish and protect. Since you are thus, so too am I.\"\n\nCommentary: Simplicity is the original scenery of the fundamental ground, the inherent nature of the source. The Daoist sages' \"seeing simplicity\" means penetrating to the inherent nature of the source. *Zhuangzi*'s \"embodying purity and simplicity\" likewise clarifies this undefiled, pure nature-body. Both the Mysterious School and Chan School take the attainment of this original scenery as their ultimate goal, as can be verified. As for \"embracing the uncarved block,\" this corresponds to what the Chan tradition calls \"preserving and maintaining.\" \"Seeing simplicity and embracing the uncarved block\" is the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye of the Daoist lineage. The cultivation of the Mysterious School may be said to correspond most closely with the supreme vehicle of the Buddha’s teaching. Thus, Great Pearl Chan Master said: \"Those of great capacity use it and find it the same; those of small capacity cling to it and find it different.\" Differences in capacity and insight give rise to the Three Teachings, but delusion and awakening lie with the person, not with the differences or similarities of the teachings.\n\n**152. Inheriting Constancy and Inheriting Illumination**\n*Laozi* said: \"Use its light and return to illumination; leave no misfortune for the self—this is called inheriting constancy.\" He also said: \"Good conduct leaves no tracks; good speech bears no flaws; good calculation requires no counting rods; good closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened; good binding uses no cords yet cannot be untied. Thus the sage always excels at saving people, so none are abandoned; always excels at saving things, so none are discarded—this is called inheriting illumination.\"\n\nThe Daoist sages expounded the principles of inheriting constancy and inheriting illumination to guide people in realizing the Dharma-body of constancy. This Dharma-body of constancy is the wondrously luminous, inherently awakened nature of all beings. Whether called \"constancy\" or \"illumination,\" their meaning is not two. \"Inheriting\" means to continue, that is, to inwardly merge with the original mind and silently accord with the Dao of true constancy. Though this is not something ordinary people can comprehend, it is also not separate from their daily activities. If one can turn inward and seek it, one may suddenly awaken to the mind-source and open the eye of sagely wisdom. The danger lies in beings using their light yet failing to return to illumination in their daily lives.",

      "translated_text": "What does it mean to \"use one's light\"? Changqing An said: \"Each of you possesses a great treasure. From the eye-gate, light radiates to illuminate mountains, rivers, and the great earth; from the ear-gate, light radiates to encompass all sounds. Thus, the six gates ceaselessly emit light day and night—this is called the *Samādhi of Radiant Light*, yet one fails to recognize it.\" The Daoist sages return to illumination precisely to guide people back to the mind-source. Just as recognizing the lamp’s light leads to the lamp itself, illumination then continues without end.\n\nThe five lines beginning with *\"Virtuous action leaves no trace\"* reveal the wondrous functioning of inherent nature, free from contrivance. The four lines beginning with *\"Ever skillfully saving others\"* reveal the vow of great compassion, one with all beings. For those who perfectly realize the One Mind, self and other are not separate, and self and things are without barrier. Thus, their response to suffering is as if their own—seeing others drowning as if they themselves were drowning, they cannot help but skillfully save and deliver.\n\n---\n\n**Great Compliance and Great Tranquility**\nThe Daoist sages said: *\"Profound is the mysterious virtue, distant indeed! It moves contrary to things, yet attains Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Heaven and Earth\"* chapter states: *\"When nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin. When virtue reaches this, it becomes one with the beginning. This oneness is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Merging with the cries of all things, it harmonizes with heaven and earth. This harmony is subtle, appearing foolish or dull—this is called mysterious virtue, one with Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *\"Lie Yukou\"* chapter further says: *\"The perfected person returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in the realm of nothing-whatsoever. Like water flowing without form, it diffuses into the great purity. Alas! You know the fine but not the great tranquility.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *Great Tranquility* is the realm of effortless stability, the land of the subtle and formless, the boundless expanse of the supreme mystery—free from disaster, harm, entanglement, or sorrow, the utmost auspiciousness. Only when emotions are forgotten and views extinguished, when one suddenly awakens and realizes this, may one be said to correspond to it. In initial practice, if one can sit in stillness for three hours without external breath, this may be called a partial correspondence. In short, before body and mind attain great samādhi, there can be no talk of *Great Tranquility*. Only with samādhi does tranquility arise.\n\n*Great Compliance* is the great naturalness. There is the *Great Compliance of Qi-transformation*—the transformations of fire and seasons, purely spontaneous, wondrously accordant with the primordial, like the butcher’s carving of the ox or the hunchback’s catching of the cicada. There is also the *Great Compliance of Spirit-transformation*—where environment and wisdom merge perfectly, and the mind turns freely without obstruction, as with the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s ten-stage bodhisattvas, who attain mastery over mind and dharma, their thoughts manifesting unfathomable spiritual transformations with boundless subtlety. This is the ultimate *Great Compliance*! Yet without returning to the utmost emptiness and merging with the Dao, one cannot easily reach this realm.\n\n---\n\n**Mysterious Virtue and Mysterious Sameness**\nThe Daoist sages said: *\"The Dao is revered, virtue is noble—nothing commands them, yet they are ever spontaneous. Thus, the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures; it rears, raises, matures, ripens, nourishes, and shelters. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called mysterious virtue.\"*\n\nThey also said: *\"Profound is the mysterious virtue, distant indeed! It moves contrary to things, yet attains Great Compliance.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* states: *\"When nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin. When virtue reaches this, it becomes one with the beginning. This oneness is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. Merging with the cries of all things, it harmonizes with heaven and earth. This harmony is subtle, appearing foolish or dull—this is called mysterious virtue, one with Great Compliance.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** Both Laozi and Zhuangzi expound *mysterious virtue*. *Mysterious virtue* is the cultivation of the Dao, another name for the ever-abiding true mind. Only by returning to the beginningless can one realize *mysterious virtue*. When mind and breath interdepend, and true emptiness manifests, this may be called *\"when nature is cultivated, virtue returns to its origin.\"* The lines *\"acts yet does not rely\"* and so on describe the wondrousness of responding without intention, achieving without dwelling. If there is self, there is a beginning; if there is selfishness, there is no universality. Thus, to realize *mysterious virtue* is to embrace all things without intention, to follow events without attachment—like a mirror reflecting images, the sun shining, the wind moving, responding to things and letting them go without claiming merit.\n\nThe Daoist sages, having expounded *mysterious virtue*, further expound *mysterious sameness*. The scripture says: *\"Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots, harmonize the light, merge with the dust—this is called mysterious sameness. Thus, it cannot be approached or estranged; it cannot be benefited or harmed; it cannot be exalted or debased. Therefore, it is honored by all under heaven.\"*\n\n**Commentary:** *Mysterious sameness* means turning the myriad streams to merge into the mysterious, dwelling in the wondrous without duality. As in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *\"Entry into the Dharma Realm\"* chapter, the fifty-three spiritual friends each teach distinct Dharma gates, yet all dissolve into self-nature and attain liberation. Liberation is the same, yet the gates differ; equality appears within difference, and difference manifests within equality. Thus, one who masters the function of *mysterious sameness* can manifest differentiated forms within undifferentiated reality, enter undifferentiated samādhi within differentiated forms, reveal differentiated realms within undifferentiated samādhi, and demonstrate undifferentiated wisdom within differentiated realms—wondrously entering the *Avataṃsaka*’s gate of unimpeded liberation.\n\nMaster Jì of Cáoshān established the *Three Kinds of Falling*. The adept of *mysterious sameness* can be at ease anywhere—this is *following the falling*. Moving freely according to kind—this is *kindred falling*. For example, after attaining the Dao, Immortal Chén Cuìxū carried a shoulder-pole to make barrels for others, singing in the marketplace: *\"The leaky teaching, the leakless—how does the water flow through?\"*",
      "overlap_context": "nation,\" their meaning is not two. \"Inheriting\" means to continue, that is, to inwardly merge with the original mind and silently accord with the Dao of true constancy. Though this is not something ordinary people can comprehend, it is also not separate from their daily activities. If one can turn inward and seek it, one may suddenly awaken to the mind-source and open the eye of sagely wisdom. The danger lies in beings using their light yet failing to return to illumination in their daily lives.",

      "translated_text": "Once the perfect and subtle is realized, \"inner and outer become one true emptiness.\" Is this not akin to the *Avataṃsaka*’s Incense-Selling Elder and the Ferryman Vasu, who guided beings with skillful means?\n\nWhile Yǎngshān was sweeping the ground, Wéishān asked: “Dust cannot be swept away, and emptiness does not arise on its own. What is meant by ‘dust cannot be swept away’?” Yǎngshān swept the ground once. Wéishān then asked: “What is meant by ‘emptiness does not arise on its own’?” Yǎngshān pointed to himself and then to Wéishān. Wéishān said: “If dust cannot be swept away and emptiness does not arise on its own, then apart from this path, what else can be done?” Yǎngshān swept the ground once more, then pointed to himself and again to Wéishān.\n\nWhile Línjì was planting pines, Huángbò asked: “Why plant so many pines deep in the mountains?” Línjì replied: “First, to adorn the mountain gate; second, to serve as a signpost for later generations.” Having spoken, he struck the ground three times with his hoe. Huángbò said: “Though you say so, you have already received my thirty blows.” Línjì struck the ground three more times and let out a long *xū*. Huángbò then declared: “Our lineage will flourish greatly through you.”\n\nIn this way, not a single dharma fails to be mysteriously identical with the mundane, the conventional, and the real—revolving through the ten thousand currents, all enter the gate of non-duality, wondrously accordant with the principle of non-arising.\n\nThe wonder of *mysterious sameness* has two aspects:\nFirst, traces may be the same while functions differ.\nSecond, traces may differ while functions remain the same.\n\nFor example, in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s fifty-three visits to good spiritual friends within the realm of reality, some appear as bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, some as kings or householders, some as immortals or non-Buddhist practitioners, and even as boys or girls. Though their circumstances—whether favorable or adverse, provisional or real—vary, their reliance on the abode of Vairocana’s dharma is one. This is what is meant by *traces differing while functions remain the same*.\n\nMaster Qiánxū of the Hidden Void said: “My sameness is sameness with the mysterious, not sameness with traces.” This illustrates the point.\n\nAs for *traces being the same while functions differ*, this embodies the principle of harmony without dissipation. For instance, both the awakened and the unawakened may sleep, sit, see, hear, eat, and drink in the same way, yet their realms are vastly different. Take sleep, for example: the perfected one remains the same whether awake or asleep, while the ordinary person’s spirit and soul are inverted, their dreams chaotic as mountains. Or consider those who have not cultivated practice—their breath roars like thunder in sleep, and their spirit and breath do not guard each other. But those who have long cultivated practice, when they sleep, their mind and breath depend on each other, their nasal breath silent, as if entering samādhi. This is what the sūtras call the “samādhi of lying down.” When ordinary people enter the realm of sounds and forms, they are turned by them, but the sage is not. This is what is meant by *traces being the same while functions differ*.\n\n---\n\n**155. Knowing Glory and Guarding Humility**\nThe ancient sage said: “Know its glory, guard its humility, and become the valley of the world. As the valley of the world, the constant virtue is fulfilled, and one returns to simplicity.”\n\nExplanation: Glory and humility are metaphorical expressions, ultimately pointing to body and mind. The mind’s essence is vast, embracing the ten thousand images—this is the ever-abiding true mind, the inherently pure and luminous substance, unchanging through kalpas, utterly transcendent. This is the image of glory. The four great elements of the physical body are a temporary aggregation, impure and turbid—this is the image of humility.\n\nIf one forgets the body and unites the mind with the breath, empties all that exists, and harmonizes mind and breath, forgetting both glory and humility, gradually attaining great tranquility, then inner and outer both become empty, forming a circle ○. This image is called the “hollow center,” the valley of the world.\n\nWhen body and mind are both forgotten and the roots and dust are extinguished, the primordial true yang qi surges through the passes to the crown, embracing the dharma-body and nurturing the physical form, nourishing both inner and outer. Body and mind become one, guest and host merge, form and emptiness unite, equality without duality, wondrously accordant with thusness. The constant virtue is fulfilled. The six consciousnesses forgotten, the three poisons extinguished, one returns to the primordial chaos, where being and non-being are not established, and neither the realms of sage nor ordinary can contain it. This is the ultimate return to the source.\n\nAlas! What surpasses this in the wonder of returning to simplicity?\n\n---\n\n**156. Spontaneous Arising and Conditioned Arising**\n*Spontaneous arising* depends on the original source of self-nature, arising naturally and effortlessly. The ancient sage said: “Good conduct leaves no tracks, good planning requires no schemes, good closure has no bolts yet cannot be opened, good binding has no cords yet cannot be untied.”\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* said: “Neither this nor that can be deemed odd or even—this is called the pivot of the Dao. Only when the pivot is at the center of the ring can it respond endlessly.” He also said: “The clan of Rǎnxiàng attained the center of the ring and followed its completion, harmonizing with things without beginning or end, without near or far.” And again: “The perfected one’s mind is like a mirror—neither grasping nor rejecting, responding without concealing, thus able to master things without harm.” This is the teaching of spontaneous arising in the traditions of Lǎozǐ and Zhuāngzǐ.\n\nIn Buddhism, only the Chán and Huáyán schools speak of spontaneous arising; all other schools teach *conditioned arising*. The dharmas of conditioned arising are a mixture of truth and delusion, hence distinctions of defilement and purity arise. But self-nature is purely true, without delusion, pure and undefiled, responding to things without attachment, universally compliant without partiality. Though adorned with the ten thousand practices, not a single dust arises—only this is noble.\n\nIn the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, there is a bodhisattva named Wondrous Virtue of the Tathāgata’s Spontaneous Arising. Moreover, the adornments of the Flower Treasury World are all the great manifestations of the wondrous virtue of spontaneous arising. In the *Entering the Realm of Reality* chapter, Vasumitrā’s traces appear licentious, yet whether she licks, kisses, embraces, grasps, gazes, or touches, she enables beings to be liberated from emotional bondage and attain great benefit. This reveals the great function of the Tathāgata’s wondrous virtue of spontaneous arising. Since spontaneous arising is effortless, it can transform things.",

virtue nurtures them.”\nDependent arising mixes purity and defilement; spontaneous arising holds purity without defilement—\nhence the ancient sage said: “Purity is the norm of the world.”\nDependent arising clings to mind, for subject and object have not perished;\nspontaneous arising has no clinging mind, for subject and object do not arise.\nThus the ancient sage said: “It gives birth yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, matures yet does not dominate—this is called mysterious virtue.”\n\nDependent arising establishes measure, inner and outer unmerged;\nspontaneous arising transcends all measure, revealing the inexhaustible.\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: “Embodying the boundless, roaming without trace, without inner or outer, without beginning or end, without limit or time.”\nDependent arising belongs to duality; spontaneous arising belongs to non-duality—\nhence *Zhuangzi* says: “The Dao unites as one.”\nAnd again: “Knowledge unites as one.”\nAnd: “The myriad things neither complete nor destroy, returning to unity.”\nAnd: “After thirty thousand years, they form a single purity.”\nThe ancient sage said: “When united as one, the myriad things are complete.”\nAnd again: “The sage embraces the One, serving as the world’s model.”\n\nThus the Mysterious School’s Dao fuses and pervades, the solitary truth alone revealed—\nspanning past and present, manifesting perfect completion, dissolving self and other into unity.\nWere one not of the highest wisdom, few would not sigh in awe.\n\nThe general outline of the Mysterious School and Chan School’s Dharma-gate of spontaneous arising is as above.\nMay I ask: what is its great function?\nIt is answered: emptiness, quiescence, and spontaneity—purity, tranquility, and unity.\nIts wondrous aspect may be encompassed by the ancient sage’s two phrases:\n“Non-action yet nothing left undone” and “Acting without acting.”\nThe Chan School calls this the “Dao of no effort.”\n\nBy “non-action yet nothing left undone,” it is ever quiescent, ever dynamic;\nby “acting without acting,” it is ever dynamic, ever quiescent.\nEver quiescent yet ever dynamic, thus dwelling in non-being, nothing is not non-being;\never dynamic yet ever quiescent, thus abiding in being, nothing is being.\nDwelling in non-being, nothing is not non-being—hence the great function flourishes, and the myriad virtues manifest.\nAbiding in being, nothing is being—hence sagely wisdom fuses in emptiness, not a single dust arises.\n\nAs the *Treatise of Sengzhao* says: “Responsive transformation is boundless, yet it has never acted; quiescent and unmoving, yet it has never ceased acting.”\nAnd again: “Not exhausting action, not abiding in non-action.”\nThis is truly the wondrous function of spontaneous arising, the profound practice of prajñā.\nChan and the Mysterious interpenetrate; the thousand sages share the same path.\nThough its dust and chaff may seem insignificant, they suffice to mold the likes of Yao and Shun.\n\nIn Buddhism, the Hīnayāna relies on karmic dependent arising;\nthe Yogācāra school relies on the dependent arising of the eight consciousnesses;\nthe Three Treatises school relies on the dependent arising of true suchness;\nthe Esoteric school relies on the dependent arising of the six great elements.\nThe Tiantai school speaks only of nature-possession, not nature-arising—\nnature-possession remains the tathāgatagarbha in bondage, whereas nature-arising reveals the wondrous function of the unobstructed true suchness.\n\nIn Chan, raising a fist or lifting a whisk, carrying water or moving firewood—\nnone are not the supreme truth.\nEven a single staff-strike or shout can instantly open the wise one’s eye of wisdom,\ninstantly realizing the patience of non-arising—all the wondrousness of spontaneous arising.\n*Zhuangzi*’s “acting without one” is likewise of this kind.\n\n---\n\n**Birth-and-death and death-and-birth**\n\nThe *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* says: “All conditioned things are impermanent; this is the Dharma of birth-and-death.”\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “All conditioned things are impermanent; the nature of thought is unborn and undying.”\nAll teachings speak of birth-and-death, yet only the Chan and Mysterious Schools reveal death-and-birth.\n\nAs Chan Master Yuanwu said: “Leap from the precipice, willingly take responsibility; revive after absolute death—no deceiving the sovereign.”\nThe Chan tradition often speaks of “great death, great life”—this is the wondrous principle of death-and-birth.\n\nThe Mysterious School’s *Cantong Qi* says: “When the nodes are exhausted, they alternate and succeed; the embodied dragon revives.”\nAnd: “The number of one and nine ends and begins anew; containing the primordial, empty and perilous, it scatters essence into the child.”\nAnd: “From darkness to dawn, thunder arrives to receive the tally.”\nAnd: “Concealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void; when metal restores its original nature, the cauldron’s radiance blazes.”\nAnd: “When qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest the death of the po and hun; the color shifts to purple, resplendently forming the returned elixir.”\n\nThis too reveals the wondrous principle of death-and-birth.\nBirth then death is the forward course;\ndeath then birth is the reverse turning—the mysterious mechanism of returning to life, the esoteric mystery of the elixir school.\n\nTo grasp the mysterious mechanism of death-and-birth and return to life,\none must first recognize the “empty space beyond the body”—this is where I am born.\nOnly by dying where one is born can one avoid falling into emptiness.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says: “Know the white, guard the black—spirit and brightness will come of themselves.”\nIf one does not recognize the birthplace and merely seeks stillness, ceasing thoughts, with mind extinguished and will dissolved,\none falls into withered Chan and barren emptiness—spirit and brightness do not come, not the realm where “the withered tree sings like a dragon.”\n\nThus Confucius said: “Without knowing life, how can one know death?”",

Likewise, the image of the *Ge* hexagram: the *Book of Changes* states, “Water and fire mutually extinguish.” Through mutual extinction, *Ge* is formed—this takes the meaning of extinction giving rise to life. Great death, great life—this is precisely the wonder of dying-and-living. The *Great Learning* says: “Things have roots and branches; affairs have ends and beginnings.” It does not speak of “beginning and end,” but of “end and beginning,” which also accords with the meaning of *Bo* and *Fu* following one another. Thus, the Daoist, Chan, and Confucian traditions—all reverse the current to emerge from the sea of birth and death—all grasp the esoteric principle of dying-and-living.\n\n**The Small Self and the Great Self**\nZhuangzi said: “The perfected person has no self.” He also said: “In great sameness, there is no self.” This “no self” means only the absence of the small self, not the absence of the great self. The small self is the deluded attachment of sentient beings to this seven-foot body as “I.” The great self is the true self, the great Dharma-body. The ancient sages called it the “Great Image”; Zhuangzi called it the “Great One.” Master Donghua said: “The Dharma-body is vast and firm, pervading heaven and earth; the true nature is perfectly luminous, spanning past and present.” Master Heyang said: “I ask myself, who am I? Not knowing the true self, one vainly seeks truth. How could one know that the Great One contains the primordial beginning, penetrating earth and heaven as one body?” All these refer to the great self. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* sets forth the four virtues of permanence, bliss, self, and purity. The “self” here also refers to the great self, the Dharma-body. Thus the sutra says: “Because there is the great self, it is called the great *nirvāṇa*.” Chan Master Shoushan said: “In a silver world, a golden body—sentient and insentient share one truth.” Chan Master Xiaoshou said: “Mountains, rivers, and the great earth fully reveal the Dharma-king’s body.” The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “Only the one solid, dense body manifests in every speck of dust.” The *Great Comprehension Sūtra* says: “Suchness is natural, boundlessly vast.” All these illustrate the meaning of the great self. The small self is like a single bubble in the sea; the great self is the pure, vast ocean. Once the attachment to the body is shattered, the seventh consciousness transforms, the small self dissolves, and the great self manifests—mind and realm become one, self and other are undivided.\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: “The true heart is vast and boundless; infinite immortals emerge from within. Worldly people cling to the small form; the single pearl of mystery, people do not recognize.” The “small form” refers to the physical body, the small self. The “true heart vast and boundless” refers to the great self, the Dharma-body. The *Sūtra of Perfect Enlightenment* says: “All sentient beings, from beginningless time, have been variously inverted, mistakenly recognizing the four great elements as the form of their own bodies, and the shadows of the six sense-fields as the form of their own minds.” The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “It is like abandoning a hundred thousand clear seas and recognizing only a single bubble as the whole tide, exhausting the vast ocean—you are the awakened among the deluded.” This rebukes the inversion of clinging to the physical body as the small self. The Confucian practice of “overcoming the self” is precisely overcoming this small self. When “all under heaven returns to benevolence,” the original face of *Qian* appears, and the great self, the great Dharma-body, is revealed.\n\nThe Ming Confucian Zhao Dazhou’s *Admonition on Overcoming the Self* says: “I have a great self, which looks down upon the myriad things and observes heaven and earth. If the great self is not pervaded, the small self stands alone. Once the small self is overcome, the great self flows freely. The ancients who were good at overcoming the self saw the formless and heard the soundless. Their movements left no tracks; their words were not mere quotations. The four functions returned to the one; the one truth flowed freely. Without form or direction, ritual was refined and flourished. If one has even a slight intention, stubbornness, or attachment to the self, the wondrous function becomes stagnant, leading to paralysis—this is not benevolence, but clinging to the small self. Thus, ‘no self’ is overcoming; the ‘true self’ is great. The greatest is benevolence, embodying no duality. Without seeing great and small, how can one know inner and outer? Realizing this is called sagehood; next is worthiness. The foolish cling and grasp.”\n\nI note that the sages of the Three Teachings all teach people to empty the small self and realize the great self. In the Daoist tradition, the practice lies in the interdependence of the heart and breath beyond the body. Through extreme dependence, one transforms and enters great samādhi, merging with true emptiness—this is precisely abandoning the small to pursue the great, dissolving the boundaries of inner and outer, revealing the whole of the one truth. As Master Sanfeng said: “The heart is as vast as the sun and moon; I and heaven-and-earth are inside and out.” And again: “The yang spirit’s wondrous body is one with the great void; a single grain of millet contains heaven and earth.” Master Ziyang said: “Send off the child riding a crane; when empty space shatters, the whole body is seen.” All these reveal the wonder of realizing the great self.\n\nZhuangzi’s “Seven Greats” says: “The Great One unites it; the Great Yin dissolves it; the Great Eye sees it; the Great Balance connects it; the Great Square embodies it; the Great Faith verifies it; the Great Samādhi holds it.” All these are images of the great self. Thus, the ancient worthies of the Chan school said: “The Dharma-realm is I; I am the Dharma-realm.” Those who merely take this seven-foot illusory body as “I,” not knowing to take the Dharma-realm as their body—how could they know the wonder of the great self?\n\n**Nurturing Life and Preserving Life**\nZhuangzi was skilled in discussing nurturing life; Laozi was skilled in discussing preserving life. Zhuangzi said: “The true person of old did not dream in sleep, had no worries when awake, did not relish food, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reached the heels; ordinary people’s breath reaches only the throat.”",

      "translated_text": "It is said that those who skillfully preserve life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being struck by weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and the weapon nowhere to lodge its blade. Why is this so? Because they dwell in no place of death.\n\nThis is what it means to skillfully preserve life: one realizes the true emptiness and no-self, so that neither inner nor outer things can cause harm. Emptiness thus entails no birth, and no birth entails no death. When arising and ceasing are extinguished, quiescent extinction appears—this is the meaning of preserving life, which those who merely nurture life cannot endure. Why? Because those who nurture life have not yet emptied their perception of life, and the attachment to self still remains. Where there is a view of self, there arises a view of others; where there is a view of self, there arises a view of things. Self and things perpetually stand in opposition, and thus the mind cannot remain unmoved. When the self’s mind moves, things’ minds also move (for example, when I intend to catch a fly, the fly immediately takes defensive action. Before my hand reaches the fly, it has already flown away). Thus, the rhinoceros finds a place to thrust its horn, and the tiger finds a place to set its claws.\n\nThose who preserve life maintain an unmoving body and mind, a body and mind in quiescent extinction. Those who nurture life value a broad mind and a relaxed body, with supreme harmony filling their being and the root of life eternally secure. If one comprehends and unifies these approaches, one sees that though preserving and nurturing life differ, their effects are not distinct. The practice is nothing other than the interdependence of mind and breath. When great samādhi is attained, the true yang of heaven and earth arrives unbidden. The body and mind remain unmoving, responsive yet ever quiescent, quiescent yet ever responsive. With this, one may nurture life, and with this, one may also preserve life.\n\n**160. Precelestial and Postcelestial Nurturing of Life**\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao has essence and sincerity, yet is non-actional and formless.”\nGuangchengzi said: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will naturally become upright.”\nKangcangzi said: “My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind harmonizes with my qi, my qi harmonizes with my spirit, and my spirit harmonizes with nothingness.”\nGuanyinzi said: “Unify your nature, nurture your qi, contain your virtue, and engage with things as they are created.”\n\nAll the above discourses take spirit and qi as primary, emptiness and stillness as their function—this is the study of precelestial nurturing of life.\n\nWesterners who pursue hygiene know only six principles: light, heat, water, air, diet, and exercise. They say that light must be sufficient, air must circulate, drinking water must be clean, food must be rich in nourishment, and the body must move often. They also emphasize deep breathing. When they discover microorganisms in water, they use disinfection. When they learn that the human body requires vitamins, they analyze foods containing vitamins A, B, C, and so on, extract their essence, and use it to supplement the diet. All such methods remain postcelestial. They do not know how to extend one’s spirit and qi into the outer emptiness for cultivation, or how to return from the postcelestial to the precelestial.",

      "translated_text": "As for the joys pursued by worldly people—sounds and sights, wealth and profit—these stir the inner heart, inevitably unsettling one’s essence. Lost in their allure, one forgets to return; essence scatters and spirit races, joy turning to sorrow at its peak, and the great life-force follows in its wake. This is called external joy, arising from outer circumstances rather than welling forth from within as inner joy does. Inner joy suffices to nourish life, while external joy suffices to shorten it. Inner joy arises from nature; external joy arises from emotion. Inner joy is the stairway to sagehood; external joy is the cause of downfall. In inner joy, stillness and delight unite—though delighted, the heart remains ever quiescent. In external joy, movement and delight unite; when sights, sounds, flavors, and fragrances appear before one, there has never been a case where the heart does not stir and the spirit race. Thus it depletes and exhausts the spirit, shortening the lifespan.\n\nMoreover, external joy is the joy of following the current, while inner joy is the joy of reversing the current. Inner joy responds with quiescence; external joy responds with emotion. The heavier the emotion, the deeper the downfall—hence those on the Dao keep their distance and guard against it. Master Sanfeng said: “One should seek inner joy, not outer joy.” Confucius’s “joy lies within” refers to inner joy. If one merely attends to externals, one seeks joy only to generate affliction instead. How profound these words are!\n\n**163. Worldly Dharma and Daoist Dharma**\nWorldly dharma and Daoist dharma, when viewed through the lens of perfect interpenetration, are not two. When viewed through the lens of sequential unfolding, their tendencies differ. To say they are not two means that for those who see the truth, one rectification makes all things true. Whether coughing or waving one’s arms, nothing is not the Dao’s intent; whether carrying water or moving firewood, all becomes wondrous function. Thus the ancient sage said: “Non-doing yet nothing left undone.” To depart from all forms is to be one with all dharmas—this is the wondrous function of non-abiding for those who see the truth, something vulgar learning cannot endure.\n\nNext, when viewed through sequential unfolding, their differences are as follows: worldly dharma values firmness, Daoist dharma values softness; worldly dharma values solidity, Daoist dharma values emptiness; worldly dharma values knowledge, Daoist dharma values not-knowing and not-recognizing; worldly dharma values sharp clarity, Daoist dharma values muddled simplicity; worldly dharma values scheming, Daoist dharma values stilling the mind’s machinations; worldly dharma clings to forms at every step, while cultivating the Dao departs from forms at every step; worldly dharma values recollection, cultivating the Dao values forgetting; worldly dharma esteems movement, cultivating the Dao esteems non-movement; worldly dharma takes the self as master, cultivating the Dao takes the self as guest; worldly dharma follows the current, cultivating the Dao reverses it; in worldly dharma, heart and realm stand opposed, while in Daoist dharma, heart and realm are one; worldly dharma establishes subject and object, Daoist dharma empties subject and object; worldly dharma operates through the human heart, Daoist dharma operates through the celestial heart; worldly dharma responds with emotion, Daoist dharma responds with quiescence; worldly dharma is defiled, Daoist dharma is pure; worldly dharma is a dharma of arising and ceasing, Daoist dharma belongs to the dharma of ceasing and arising; worldly dharma is bounded, Daoist dharma transcends bounds; worldly dharma has leakage, Daoist dharma has no leakage; worldly dharma is conditioned arising, Daoist dharma is nature-arising; in worldly dharma, roots and dusts intertwine, while in Daoist dharma, roots and dusts are utterly free; worldly dharma is impermanent, Daoist dharma is truly constant; worldly dharma chases after shadows while deluded about the head, Daoist dharma observes shadows while abiding at the head; worldly dharma belongs to the non-duality of duality, Daoist dharma belongs to the non-duality of absolute non-duality; worldly dharma strengthens habitual tendencies, Daoist dharma purifies habitual tendencies; worldly dharma multiplies afflictions, Daoist dharma empties afflictions; worldly dharma leads to downfall, Daoist dharma leads to transcendence. These are all their points of difference.\n\nThus the *Cantong Qi* states: “Reversal is the function of the Dao.” The ancient sage said: “Alone I am dull,” “Alone I am dim,” “I seem to be lost,” “Alone I drift, as though without sign,” “Alone I am stubborn and coarse, differing from others in valuing the nourishment of the Mother”—are these not proofs of reversing the current?\n\n**164.

      "translated_text": "Western European culture emphasizes utility and profit, cultivating materiality. This metaphysical spiritual transformation through virtue and this physical material transformation through utility—these are the points of divergence between Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nSince antiquity, the sages of our Hua land have guided the world and instructed the people, establishing their teachings with clarity of purpose, none but taking the cultivation of body and mind as their foundation. Thus, Yao and Shun transmitted the teaching: *\"Refining essence to enter the numinous is for practical application. Utilizing things to secure the body is for exalting virtue. Exhausting the numinous and knowing transformation—this is the flourishing of virtue.\"* It is also said: *\"The sage employs the numinous Dao to establish teaching, and all under heaven submits.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi* states: *\"Thus, when the sage has no choice but to govern the world, nothing compares to non-action. Through non-action, the natural conditions of life and destiny are secured. Therefore, if the noble person can refrain from loosening the five viscera, refrain from overtaxing their hearing and sight, dwell in stillness yet manifest like a dragon, remain profound and silent yet resound like thunder, move spiritually and heaven follows—then, at ease in non-action, the myriad things are steamed and piled up. What leisure do I have to govern the world!\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The person of royal virtue moves plainly yet disdains entanglement in affairs, standing firm in the root and origin, knowing communion with the numinous. Thus their virtue is vast, and when their heart issues forth, it is met by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, and life does not become luminous without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue? Vast and boundless, suddenly emerging, vigorously moving, with the myriad things following—this is the person of royal virtue. Gazing into the obscure, listening to the soundless, within the obscure they alone perceive the dawn; within the soundless, they alone hear harmony. Thus, profound beyond profundity, they can embody things; numinous beyond the numinous, they can attain essence. Therefore, in their interaction with the myriad things, they meet all demands with utmost emptiness, galloping in time to bind their abode.\"*\n\nFrom this, we know that the ancient sages’ teachings all valued inner cultivation, returning to simplicity and restoring purity, penetrating the root and illuminating nature, attaining the harmony of the center—neither resisting nor anticipating. Only then can the spiritual function be boundless, responding to opportunities without obstruction, engaging with things without being ensnared by them. This is the esteem of spiritual transformation.\n\nMaterial culture, by contrast, must seek after things, preparing objects to nourish form, indulging in extravagance and gratifying desires. The spiritual source daily dries up, and one grows ever more distant from the Dao. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Chasing the myriad things without return, exhausting echoes for sound, form racing with shadow.\"*\n\nIf spiritual transformation through inner cultivation is pursued, then one finds sufficiency within oneself. The heart and breath are harmoniously balanced, form is preserved and the Dao is complete, containing light and inwardly illuminating, penetrating the three origins of virtue. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Above, they wander with the Creator; below, they befriend those beyond life and death, without beginning or end.\"* Gains and losses support one another—truly, this cannot be measured by conventional standards.\n\n*Zhuangzi* also states: *\"Those who cultivate the inner act without seeking fame; those who cultivate the outer aspire to expenditure. Acting without seeking fame, only the commonplace has luster; aspiring to expenditure—this is the merchant. Thus, the distinction between the merchant and the Daoist is the difference between Western material culture and East Asian spiritual culture.\"*\n\nMaterial transformation takes form-dharmas as its focus, using form-dharmas to nourish form and mind, satisfying the demands of the environment. Western civilization often boasts of this, unaware that as the environment constantly changes, needs become endless. Human desires grow daily, the original nature darkens, the six thieves attack in concert, and the source of life dries up. Thus, the more material civilization advances, the shorter human lifespans become; the more intense competition grows, the more bitter life becomes.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"To nourish form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are cases where things are abundant but form is not nourished. Life necessarily does not depart from form, yet there are cases where form does not depart but life perishes. Life’s coming cannot be refused, its going cannot be halted. Alas! The world believes that nourishing form suffices to preserve life, yet if nourishing form truly does not suffice to preserve life, then what is the world worth?\"*\n\nWang Dashen states: *\"All sentient beings rely entirely on form and mind for sustenance. The five aggregates are at peace, the six senses enjoy their use, the six dusts serve as attendants—self-satisfied, they pass their days in pleasure, unaware that their original, luminous nature is trapped within form and mind. The five aggregates bury it, the six senses entangle it, the six dusts seal it off, so that this luminous nature is defiled for a thousand lives, wandering for ten thousand kalpas, without the slightest chance of liberation.\"*\n\nLiu Chenggan writes: *\"By today, with foreign lands interconnected, people are increasingly astonished by material inventions, mistaking them for principle—as if heaven created humanity, endowing them with a hundred bones and four limbs, solely to enjoy this world’s material things. Exhausting their thoughts and talents, they sink into greed, anger, delusion, and arrogance, striving to fulfill their desires. If this continues, will they not be reduced to beasts—or worse, devour one another? Morals grow filthy, human nature treacherous—what could be more terrifying, more lamentable!\"*\n\nI say: The greatest harm of material transformation lies in following the self and chasing things. Once one chases things, conflict and struggle inevitably arise. Today’s new weapons, used to bombard cities and harm living beings—are these not gifts of material transformation?\n\nThe greatest benefit of spiritual transformation lies in preserving the Great Harmony, maintaining serenity of body and mind, being without contention in the world, without competition among people. Like Emperor Yao’s tranquility, King Wen’s harmony, Confucius’s ease, Zhuang Zhou’s stillness—thus one may roam freely in the sea of nature, dissolving self and other in the Great Unity.",

      "translated_text": "**165. Steam Baths and True Qi Baths**\n\nIn recent times, Westerners have pursued hygiene with great precision. Beyond cold-water bathing, they have devised what they call \"steam baths,\" using pipes to channel water vapor and wash the entire body. When the limbs and bones undergo such a steam infusion, it can harmonize the blood and bring comfort to the whole body.\n\nYet this is but acquired *qi*, capable only of external fumigation, not internal permeation—it can cleanse the body but not the mind. It does not compare to the Daoist teachings of *mao-you* purification, which entirely relies on the primordial *True Yi’s* *qi* to scour both inner and outer, saturating the *ying* and *wei*, replenishing *qi* and blood, and strengthening both body and mind.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* depicts the *True Qi* bath in most wondrous terms:\n\n> *\"Cultivate it without cease,\n> And the *qi* moves like clouds and rain.\n> Drizzling like spring’s gentle soak,\n> Flowing like ice’s slow release.\n> From head it streams to feet,\n> Then ascends once more in full.\n> It courses through the boundless void,\n> Pervading all within the frame.\n> Reversion marks the Dao’s proof,\n> Weakness holds virtue’s key.\n> It weeds out old impurities,\n> Refining even the minute.\n> The turbid finds the path to clarity,\n> Prolonged dimness yields to light.\"*\n\nMaster Zhongli Quan said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation knows no cold or heat—this is the loftiest Daoist sage.\"*\n\nMaster Cui Xu said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation knows no cold or heat, pure Yang flows without birth or death.\"*\n\nMaster Lü (Dongbin) said: *\"True Qi’s fumigation strengthens the limbs.\"*\n\nCao Wenyi said: *\"It melts the meridians, transforming sinew and bone.\"*\n\nMaster Ge (Hong) said: *\"Jade nectar irrigates, the Grotto Chamber streams with tassels, the celestial mechanism is revealed—no myriad sounds can compare.\"*\n\nZhuo Hu said: *\"It arises like oil, ascends like mist, steams like billows, congeals like haze. The skin knits inch by inch, white *qi* pierces the sky.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said: *\"Harmonious *qi* fills and suffuses the whole body, coursing up and down, harmonizing the hundred vessels. It flows through the four limbs, pervades the frame, filling the heart with spring’s warmth—its state like mild intoxication.\"*\n\nZhang Ziyang said: *\"At first, it is like the moon filling a thousand mountains; then, like the moon cradled in ten thousand waters. The pores feel as if freshly bathed, the bones and meridians as if deeply asleep. The spirit is like lovers’ joyous union, the soul and body like mother and child’s tender clinging. A single intent of harmonious *qi*—the skin becomes refreshingly permeable.\"*\n\nZhang Sanfeng said: *\"Wait for that single point to return and submit, and the body transforms into the four seasons’ spring. A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance, each rain’s passing brings renewal. All day, it lingers like a drunkard’s haze, serene in guarding the Grotto’s spring. When all yin essence is stripped away, it becomes a lump of pure Yang gold.\"*\n\nThese are the inner visions of the Daoist *True Qi* bath, the wondrous path of cleansing body and mind. How could mere scientists ever speak of such things?\n\n---\n\n**166. Longevity and Non-Birth (Part I)**\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Buddhism proclaims non-birth, Daoism proclaims longevity. Are non-birth and longevity opposed in their aims?\"*\n\nI answer: *\"Non-birth\" employs apophatic discourse, while \"longevity\" employs cataphatic discourse—the difference lies in negating delusion versus manifesting virtue. The sages’ methods for liberating the world fall into two gates: breaking and embracing.*\n\n*\"Non-birth\" emphasizes the breaking gate, while \"longevity\" emphasizes the embracing gate. Master Mazu first established \"mind is Buddha,\" then later swept away traces to say \"neither mind nor Buddha\"—this is a shift from the embracing gate to the breaking gate.*\n\n*Non-nature and non-birth* are Buddhism’s breaking gate, yet it does not ignore the embracing gate. The *Lotus Sutra’s* \"Lifespan\" chapter states: *\"Thus have I attained Buddhahood for an immeasurable, boundless asamkhya of kalpas, my lifespan eternal, ever-abiding, never perishing.\"* Its verse says: *\"My wisdom-power is thus, my radiance illumines the boundless. My lifespan spans countless kalpas, gained through long-cultivated karma.\"*\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra’s* \"Longevity\" chapter recounts Kāśyapa Bodhisattva asking in verse:\n\n> *\"How does one attain long life,\n> A vajra body unbreakable?\n> By what cause and condition\n> Does one gain great firmness?\n> Among all dharmas,\n> All arise from blissful nature.\n> I pray, Great Sage,\n> Explain this to me in detail.\"*\n\nObserve: Kāśyapa is a Chan patriarch, yet he addresses the Buddha as \"Great Sage\" and earnestly inquires about the method of longevity—how could there not be profound meaning in this?\n\nThe Tathāgata then expounded the Dharma gate of birth, death, and long life. Kāśyapa further asked: *\"If bodhisattvas cultivate equanimity toward all beings, should they not attain long life, know past lives, abide in the world without change? Yet now, World-Honored One, by what cause and condition is your lifespan so short, like that of ordinary humans? Does the Tathāgata not hold enmity toward beings? What past evil karma did you commit, how many beings did you harm, to receive this short lifespan of less than a hundred years?\"*\n\nThe Buddha told Kāśyapa: *\"Good son, why do you speak such coarse words before the Tathāgata? The Tathāgata’s long life is supreme among all lifespans, the foremost. The eternal Dharma he attains is the highest among all eternal things.\"*\n\nKāśyapa Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha: *\"World-Honored One, how can you say the Tathāgata has attained immeasurable life?\"*\n\nThe Buddha told Kāśyapa: *\"Good son, just as the eight great rivers—first the Gaṅgā, second the Yamunā, third the Sarasvatī, fourth the Airavata, fifth the Mahā, sixth the Sindhu, seventh the Vakṣu, eighth the Sītā—along with all smaller rivers, all flow into the great ocean...\"*",

      "translated_text": "Kāśyapa, just as all the lifespans of humans, gods, earth, and empty space—along with the great rivers—all flow into the ocean of the Tathāgata’s lifespan, so too does the Tathāgata’s lifespan become immeasurable.\n\nFurthermore, Kāśyapa, it is like Lake Anavatapta and the four great rivers. The Tathāgata is likewise the source of all life.\n\nKāśyapa, just as among all eternal things, empty space is foremost, so too is the Tathāgata foremost among all eternal things.\n\nKāśyapa, just as among all medicines, ghee is supreme, so too is the Tathāgata’s lifespan foremost among all beings.”\n\nKāśyapa Bodhisattva again addressed the Buddha: “World-Honored One, if the Tathāgata’s lifespan is thus, should he not abide for an eon, or pass away after an eon, constantly revealing the wondrous Dharma like a ceaseless downpour?”\n\n“Kāśyapa, you should not conceive of the Tathāgata’s realm in terms of arising and ceasing. Kāśyapa, if there are bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, upāsikās, or even non-Buddhist *ṛddhi*-attaining immortals who gain mastery—whether abiding for an eon or passing after an eon, walking through empty space, sitting and lying at ease, emitting fire from their left side and water from their right, their bodies wreathed in smoke and flame like a blazing pyre—if they wish to extend their lifespan, they can do so at will, freely determining its length. Even such *ṛddhi*-attaining beings possess such wondrous powers. How much more so the Tathāgata, who has attained mastery over all dharmas, and could not fail to abide for half an eon, a full eon, a hundred eons, a thousand eons, or countless eons? For this reason, you should know that the Tathāgata is the eternal Dharma, the unchanging Dharma. This body of the Tathāgata is a transformed body, not born of sustenance. To liberate beings, he manifests like a poison tree, and thus relinquishes his body to enter *nirvāṇa*.”\n\nHere, the Tathāgata demonstrates that the Buddha’s lifespan is immeasurable, and though his manifested body enters *nirvāṇa*, it is not true extinction, for his Dharma-body and reward-body abide eternally. The manifested body is like the moon reflected in water—sometimes appearing, sometimes not—while the true moon in the sky remains constant and unceasing. The Tathāgata’s Dharma-body and reward-body are likewise eternal and imperishable.\n\nThe *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, in the “Four Marks” chapter, states: “It is like a potter who, having made a vessel, then breaks it. Liberation is not like this. True liberation is true birth without extinction. Therefore, liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is likewise—neither born nor extinguished, neither aging nor dying, neither broken nor destroyed, not a conditioned dharma. For this reason, he is called the Tathāgata. Entering great *nirvāṇa*, he is neither aging nor dying—what meaning could this have? Aging is called transmutation: white hair and wrinkled face. Dying is the breaking of the body and the end of life. Such things do not exist in liberation. Because they are absent, it is called liberation. The Tathāgata has no white hair or wrinkled face, no conditioned dharmas—thus, the Tathāgata is without aging. Without aging, there is no death. Furthermore, liberation is called freedom from illness. What is illness? The four hundred and four diseases, and other external harms that assail the body. Where these are absent, it is called liberation. Freedom from illness is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is without illness, and thus his Dharma-body is also without illness. Such freedom from illness is the Tathāgata. Death is called the breaking of the body and the end of life. Where death is absent, it is *amṛta*. This *amṛta* is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata possesses such merits. How then could one say the Tathāgata is impermanent? To say he is impermanent is without basis. How could this vajra-body be impermanent? Therefore, the Tathāgata is not called one who meets his end.”\n\nHere, the Tathāgata demonstrates that he is neither born nor extinguished, neither aging nor dying, neither broken nor destroyed, without white hair, wrinkled face, or other blemishes, and without illness—this is called true liberation. It is no different from the immortality of the immortals. One might say that immortals and Buddhas share the same essence, like water and milk perfectly blended.\n\nFurthermore, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, in the “Departure from the Worldly” chapter, speaks of ten kinds of mastery. The first is mastery over lifespan, for he abides for incalculable eons. The Buddha, in the *Sūtra of Immeasurable Life*, extensively reveals the long and distant lifespan of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life, saying: “The lifespan of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life is so long and vast that it cannot be reckoned or measured. Can you comprehend it? Suppose all the beings in the ten directions, having attained human form, were to become *śrāvakas* and *pratyekabuddhas* and gather together. With single-minded meditation and the full extent of their wisdom, they were to calculate and estimate his lifespan over hundreds of thousands of myriads of eons—still, they could not exhaust it or know its limit. The lifespans of *śrāvakas*, bodhisattvas, gods, and humans are likewise beyond the reach of calculation or analogy.” Taking “Immeasurable Life” as the Buddha’s name reveals the ultimate fruit of immortality. Thus, the Buddhist teachings do not fail to proclaim longevity.\n\nMoreover, *Liezi* says: “The doubt of the unborn is unique.” *Zhuangzi* says: “Only after transcending past and present can one enter the state of neither death nor birth.” *Laozi* says: “Only one who does not take life as something to be prized is better than one who values life.” Li Daochun says: “In quiescent realization, there is no birth.” Thus, the Daoist tradition does not fail to proclaim the unborn. Some speak of the unborn, others of long life—both employ the two gates of severing and embracing, guiding beings according to their capacities, using expedient and ultimate teachings, alternating between affirmation and negation, all fundamentally the same principle. One should not cling to one and criticize the other, giving rise to disputes over superiority and inferiority.",

      "translated_text": "**167. Longevity and the Unborn (II)**\n\n*Laozi* says: “That by which Heaven and Earth endure long and last long is their not living for themselves—therefore they attain long life.” Thus, to attain longevity, one must not dwell in the appearance of life; one must relinquish the form of the long-lived, forget the body and abandon form, living yet without life—unlike the ten kinds of immortals in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, who fix their thoughts to preserve form and cling to the vital principle as ultimate. Yongjia Xuanjue, the Chan Master, says in his *Song of Realizing the Dao*: “Who is without thought? Who is without birth? Truly, in the absence of birth, nothing is not born.” This means that if one truly accords with the unborn nature, there is also no extinction. Therefore, the longevity of the Daoist school does not fall into the view of eternalism, nor does the unborn of the Buddhist school fall into the view of annihilation. Because it does not fall into eternalism, though living, it does not dwell in the appearance of life; because it does not fall into annihilation, though unborn, it naturally lacks nothing in birth. The unborn who are born are Buddhas; the living who are unborn are immortals. How can one lump them into two separate categories, rank them as superior or inferior, and reject longevity in favor of the unborn?\n\n**168. The Perfected and the True Person**\n\nWithin the *Nanhua Jing*, the virtues and attributes of the Perfected and the True Person appear repeatedly. I have gathered and compiled them here to spare the reader the trouble of searching and to glimpse the essential meaning of the ancients’ teachings.\n\nThe “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter says: “The Perfected is without self.”\nThe “Equalizing Things” chapter says: “The Perfected is spirit-like: great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be heated; the Yellow River and the Milky Way may freeze, yet they cannot be chilled; swift thunder may split mountains, yet they cannot be harmed; violent winds may shake the seas, yet they cannot be startled. Such beings ride the clouds and qi, mount the sun and moon, and wander beyond the four seas. Life and death bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of profit and harm?”\nThe “Revolutions of Heaven” chapter says: “The Perfected of old borrowed the Way of benevolence, lodged in the abode of righteousness, and roamed the wilds of freedom. They ate from fields of simplicity, stood in gardens of non-transaction. Freedom is non-action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure. The ancients called this ‘gathering the true in wandering.’”\nThe “Attaining Life” chapter says: “Have you alone not heard of the Perfected’s self-conduct? They forget their liver and gall, abandon their ears and eyes, wander in vagueness beyond the dust and grime, roam freely in the work of non-action—this is called acting without reliance, growing without control.”\nThe “Responding to Emperors and Kings” chapter says: “The mind of the Perfected is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds without storing, and thus can master things without harm.”\nThe “Mastering Life” chapter says: “Life has that from which it sprouts; death has that to which it returns. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know where they exhaust. If not this, then what is their source? To attain this is the utmost beauty and joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy is called the Perfected.” It also says: “As water in a ditch flows without effort and its talent is natural, so the Perfected’s virtue: without cultivation, things cannot depart from it. Like Heaven’s natural height, Earth’s natural dignity, the sun and moon’s natural brightness—what cultivation is needed?”\nIt further says: “The Perfected: above, they peer into the azure sky; below, they plunge into the Yellow Springs. They brandish and cast off the eight directions, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged.”\nThe “Knowledge Wanders North” chapter says: “The Perfected do nothing; the great sages do not act—this is called observing Heaven and Earth.”\nThe “Gengsang Chu” chapter says: “The Perfected share food upon the earth and share joy in Heaven. They do not entangle themselves with the profit and harm of others, do not conspire in strangeness, do not scheme together, do not act in concert. They come and go with ease and openness—this is called the warp of preserving life.”\nThe “Lie Yukou” chapter says: “Those Perfected return their spirit to the beginningless and delight in the realm of nothing-whatsoever. Like water flowing without form, they issue forth into the Great Purity.”\nThe “Under Heaven” chapter says: “Not departing from the true is called the Perfected.”\nThe “Way of Heaven” chapter says: “The Perfected have a world—is this not vast? Yet it is not enough to burden them. The world may wield power, yet they do not join it; they discern the absence of falsity and do not shift with profit. They exhaust the true in things and can guard their root. Thus, they leave Heaven and Earth behind, abandon the myriad things, and their spirit is never troubled. Penetrating the Dao, uniting with virtue, they withdraw from benevolence and righteousness, make guests of ritual and music—the mind of the Perfected is settled.”\n\nSurveying the above passages, the phrase “the Perfected is without self” is most pivotal. “Without self” means transforming the seventh consciousness into the wisdom of equality. When the attachment to self is emptied, one can roam freely in the sea of non-action’s nature and attain the joy of true purity. The passage stating that “great marshes may burn, yet they cannot be heated; the Yellow River and the Milky Way may freeze, yet they cannot be chilled” describes the state after the seventh consciousness is transformed. With the discriminating attachment of emotions already gone, cold and heat cannot invade—even life and death bring no change, for the bond of shared-life mechanism has been shattered.\n\nGenerally, those who study the Dao must first empty the attachment to self, then empty the attachment to dharmas. The seventh *manas* consciousness is the root of self-attachment; this consciousness takes the seeing aspect of the eighth *ālayavijñāna* as the inner self and clings to the perceived aspect of the sixth consciousness as self-awareness. If this consciousness is transformed, the attachment to self is emptied, and attainment of the Dao is certain. Thus, the *Verses on Consciousness-Only* say: “The second transformation is the consciousness called *manas*.”",

      "translated_text": "With its dependence on that transformed condition as its object, *manas* takes deliberation as its nature and characteristic. It is constantly accompanied by four afflictions: delusion of self, view of self, arrogance of self, and craving of self, along with other associated factors such as contact. It is classified as obscured and indeterminate.\n\nThe *Guhyagarbha Sūtra* states in verse:\n“*Manas* clings to the *ālayavijñāna*,\nAs a magnet draws iron.\nLike a serpent with two heads,\nEach performs its own function—\nSo too the defiled mind,\nGrasping and seizing the *ālayavijñāna*,\nEngages in the activities of self,\nAugmenting the domain of ‘mine.’\nTogether with the *manovijñāna*,\nIt acts as a cause, transforming and declining.\nWithin the body, it generates warmth and touch,\nMovement and all activities.”\n\nMoreover, the First Patriarch Bodhidharma’s *Dharma Gate of Pacifying the Mind* states:\n“Question: Why do worldly people study and inquire yet fail to attain the Dao?\nAnswer: Because they perceive a self, they do not attain the Dao.”\n\nThis “self” is the “I.” The perfected person encounters suffering without sorrow, meets joy without delight—because they do not perceive a self, they remain unaware of suffering or joy. By forgetting the self, they attain utter emptiness. If even the self is extinguished, what thing remains that is not extinguished? Thus, when the attachment to self is emptied, the Dao is surely attained. The sage is without self; the perfected person is without “I.” Therein, the marvelous emptiness of objective conditions and wisdom arises, the roots and dust are wholly transformed—this is what all profound Chan and mystery together realize, the common destination of all sages, the secret key of Dao cultivation.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s “Great Master” chapter says:\n“What is a true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few, did not presume upon success, did not scheme over affairs. Such were they: if they erred, they did not regret; if they succeeded, they did not take pride. Such were they: they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao like this.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry; their food was not savory, their breath was deep. The true person’s breath comes from the heels; the common person’s breath comes from the throat. Those who are subdued, their words choke as if retching. Those whose desires run deep, their heavenly mechanism is shallow.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life, did not detest death. Emerging, they did not rejoice; entering, they did not resist. Swiftly they came, swiftly they went—no more. They did not forget their beginning, nor did they seek their end. Receiving, they rejoiced in it; forgetting, they returned to it. This is called not using the mind to harm the Dao, not using human effort to assist heaven—this is the true person.\n\nSuch were they: their minds were at ease, their countenances serene, their foreheads broad. Cold as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flowed with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet no one knew their limit.”\n\nIt further states:\n“The true persons of old upheld righteousness yet did not boast; appeared insufficient yet did not yield.

The true person is one who illuminates the essence of the one true dharma-realm and saves both self and others. The perfected person is one who inwardly realizes virtue and reaches the ultimate extreme. All alike clarify the supreme Dao, accord with true constancy, transcend beyond the ten thousand existents, roam in the realm of the Great One, and revel in the garden of quiescent extinction. That Lao Dan and Guan Yin are held as exemplars of the true person carries profound meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Virtuous Persons and Spirit Persons**\nThe *Tian Di* chapter of *Zhuangzi* states:\n“I wish to hear of the virtuous person.”\nIt was said: “The virtuous person dwells without thought,\nacts without deliberation,\nharbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness.\nWithin the four seas, sharing benefit is called joy,\nsharing provision is called peace.\nYearning, like an infant who has lost its mother;\naimless, like a traveler who has lost the way.\nWealth and resources are abundant, yet they know not whence they come;\nfood and drink suffice, yet they know not from where.\nThis is called the bearing of the virtuous person.\nI wish to hear of the spirit person.”\nIt was said: “The supreme spirit rides the light,\nvanishing with form—\nthis is called illuminating the vast.\nFulfilling destiny and exhausting passion,\nheaven and earth rejoice and the ten thousand affairs dissolve;\nthe ten thousand things return to their essence—\nthis is called merging into obscurity.”\n\nThe *Xiao Yao You* chapter states:\n“The spirit person has no merit.”\n\nThe *Tian Xia* chapter states:\n“Not departing from essence—this is called the spirit person.”\n\nI observe: *Mencius* says, “What is sagely yet unfathomable is called spirit.”\nThe *Book of Changes* says, “What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called spirit.”\nThus, the spirit person attains meaning and gives rise to form,\npossessing spiritual penetrations and freedom—\nbeyond the measure of ordinary sentiments.\nThe virtuous person embraces virtue yet has not yet entered the realm of transformation.\nLu Fanghu says: “The virtuous person is one of complete virtue.\nDwelling without thought, acting without deliberation—\nwords, movements, stillness, all are without intent.\nHarboring no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—\nthis is what is meant by ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil.’\nMoreover, they share benefit with the world as joy,\nshare provision as peace,\nentrusting their bodies to heaven without awareness of this body.\nOnly by not knowing the body do they transcend the infant who has lost its mother—\nhow much more the drifting, unaware of what they depend upon,\nwandering as though having lost the way,\nriding without knowing whither they go.\nWealth, resources, food, and drink are abundant and sufficient,\nyet they know not whence they come—\nfree from intent in seeking,\nothers do not see their lack,\nand they ever seem utterly content.\nSuch is the bearing of one of complete virtue.”",

      "translated_text": "The supreme spirit ascends, and the light of sun and moon turns to shine from below. For the spirit, riding the clouds and qi, embracing sun and moon, roams in unfathomable radiance—thus it achieves this. If it were burdened by the bodily husk, how could it invert the light to gaze downward, empty and luminous, vast and boundless? Hence it is said: “With the perishing of form, this is called illuminating vastness.” The Daoist notion of passing through metal and stone without obstruction, treading sun and moon without shadow—this is the meaning.\n\nDestiny is what heaven bestows; emotion is what nature emits. When one fulfills destiny and exhausts emotion, the center is attained and harmony is also attained. Thus, above and below flow as one with heaven and earth, and the burdens of things vanish entirely. Hence it is said: “Heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve.”\n\nAs the *Zhuangzi*’s “Free and Easy Wandering” states: “On Mount Miaogu there dwells a spirit-person, whose skin is like ice and snow, whose grace is like that of a maiden. They eat no grain, but inhale the wind and drink the dew, riding clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, and roaming beyond the four seas. Their spirit congeals, causing things to be free from blight and the harvest to ripen.” Such is the virtue and appearance of the spirit-person. The virtuous person’s station is one rank below that of the spirit-person.\n\nIn the cultivation of the Mysterious Origin, after attaining the Great Return Elixir, the gate of essence is sealed, the roots of lustful mind and desire are instantly eradicated, body and mind become pure, and one embraces virtue and warms harmony, like an infant—this may be called a virtuous person. When the ten-month gestation is complete and the Dharma-body manifests, spirit transforms freely, wondrous functions arise without limit, riding wind and qi to roam beyond the six directions—this may be called a spirit-person. When one reaches the ultimate of returning to emptiness, and even emptiness crumbles to dust—this may be called a perfected person.\n\n---\n\nHong Meng Instructs on the Dao\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s “In the World of Men”:\nCloud General said, “Then what should I do?”\nHong Meng said, “Alas! How poisonous! Drift away, drift away, and return.”\nCloud General said, “I have encountered great difficulty from heaven and wish to hear a single word.”\nHong Meng said, “Alas! Nurture the heart. Simply abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your bodily form, expel your brilliance, forget human relations and things. Merge into the great primordial, release the heart and liberate the spirit, silent and without soul. The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root, each returning to its root without knowing it—confused and chaotic, never departing for a lifetime. If one knows it, this is to depart from it. Do not ask its name, do not peer into its nature—things arise of themselves.”\nCloud General said, “Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. I sought it with my own body, and now I have attained it.” He bowed twice, touched his head to the ground, rose, and departed.\n\nThis passage reveals the principle and essential technique of returning to truth. Hong Meng, or Chaos, refers to the state where thoughts and stillness are both extinguished, illumination and quiescence both forgotten, neither knowing nor recognizing, neither self nor other—what the ancient sage called “returning to the limitless.” “Expel your bodily form” means to forget the body. “Diminish your brilliance” means to forget the heart. When body and heart are both forgotten, human relations and the myriad things all vanish without trace. Thus one returns to the Great Beginning, merging with the primordial, dissolving attachments and bonds, silent and without soul. “Each returning to its root” means reverting to simplicity and returning to purity, recovering one’s original true nature. The teaching is to forget both self and others, return to chaos, leave behind the mind’s intentions, emotions, and views, abandon grasping and rejecting, transform through non-action, and restore primordial purity—only then can one drift away and return.\n\n---\n\nNie Que Asks About the Dao\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s “Knowledge Wanders North”:\nNie Que asked about the Dao from Clothed-in-Rags. Clothed-in-Rags said, “Straighten your body, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Collect your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, and the Dao will reside within you. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the past!”\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Clothed-in-Rags was greatly pleased, sang as he walked away, and said:\n“Form like a withered corpse,\nheart like dead ashes,\ntruly knowing the real,\nnot clinging to the past.\nVague and obscure,\nwithout mind, one cannot scheme with them.\nWhat sort of person is this!”",

      "translated_text": "This passage of question and answer also illustrates the foundational work of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath. Here, its meaning is further expounded:\n\n\"Straighten your body\" means the body remains unmoving so the spirit naturally settles. \"Unify your gaze\" means containing the light within and inwardly illuminating, silently lowering the inner screen to observe carefully. When this is so, \"the harmony of heaven will arrive\"—this refers to the coming of primordial true yang, when the whole body becomes warm and harmonious as if intoxicated.\n\n\"Collect your knowledge\" means the spirit relies on the breath, knowing only the breath’s ingress and egress without generating other thoughts. \"Unify your measures\" means the breath’s ingress and egress harmonize with the spirit, empty and natural, as if aligned with a marking line. For before the breath is regulated, its coming and going lack measure; but when heart and breath depend on each other and regulation becomes thoroughly familiar, purely natural, then the breath is continuous and subtle, the spirit does not leave the breath, the breath does not leave the spirit—they unite as one, and opening and closing proceed with measure.\n\nThe phrase \"spirit will come to dwell\" is most profound. All previous interpreters of the *Zhuangzi* have failed to connect it with the actual work of breath regulation, so their words miss the mark and lack grounding. \"Spirit will come to dwell\" means the original spirit appears while the heart’s discriminating consciousness vanishes. Nie Que, practicing the work in the moment, listened and suddenly awakened—then fell asleep. Clothed-in-Rags was greatly pleased, for he rejoiced in Nie Que’s ability to \"unite practice and understanding, regulating the breath only briefly before falling asleep.\"\n\nHe then departed singing, his song teaching others to keep body and mind unmoving, in a state of dim obscurity, merging into undifferentiated chaos to nurture one’s nature. Caoshan said: \"Those who study the Dao are like cats or white oxen—when hungry, they eat grass; when thirsty, they drink water, never worrying that the Dao will not be attained.\" This aligns perfectly with the meaning of \"eyes bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing from the past.\" Thus, to cultivate the Dao, one should emulate the undifferentiated state, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile—only then can one return to authenticity and recover simplicity.\n\n---\n\n172   Guan Yin Discusses the Dao (Part One)\nFrom the *Liezi*’s “The Yellow Emperor”:\nLiezi asked Guan Yin, “The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads on fire without burning, moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?”\n\nGuan Yin replied, “This is the preservation of pure qi—it does not belong to the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness.”",

      "translated_text": "Child! The fish speaks to you. All that possesses form, appearance, sound, or color belongs to the realm of things. How can things distance themselves from one another? What suffices to reach the primordial? It is merely form. Thus, things arise from the formless and rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how could they be led astray? They dwell in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things. They unify their nature, nurture their qi, and embrace their virtue, thereby penetrating to the source of all things. Those who do so preserve their Heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without flaw—how could external things intrude?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a cart: though the fall is swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He rides unaware, falls unaware; neither life nor death, neither terror nor dread, enters his breast. Thus, he encounters things without fear. If one preserved by wine can be thus, how much more so one preserved by Heaven? The sage conceals himself in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\n\nThis wondrous passage, also recorded in the *Zhuangzi*, belongs to the Daoist art of preserving life. \"Preservation of pure qi\" and \"unifying one’s nature, nurturing one’s qi\" describe the practice of heart and breath interdependent, gathering the treasures of Heaven. \"Concealing oneself in traceless order\" points to the technique of transcending the body into emptiness, concentrating the spirit in the void while emptying body and mind. \"Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things\" means returning to true emptiness, merging with the primordial before form.\n\nAll \"form, appearance, sound, and color\" pertain to the postnatal bodily form. If one clings to the bodily form in seeking the Dao, how can one transcend form and reach the primordial, where Heaven does not oppose? Only by concentrating the spirit in the emptiness beyond the body and regulating the breath can one return to the primordial state and merge with the Great Unity.\n\nBelow, the text further expounds the essence of preserving the spirit: when the spirit is whole, the body is whole; cold and heat cannot invade, nor can life and death, sorrow and peril, enter. This is why nurturing the spirit is the key to nurturing life. \"The sage conceals himself in Heaven\" means that one’s small Heaven-and-Earth (heart and breath) hibernates within the great Heaven-and-Earth (the emptiness beyond the body). In such a state, one merges with Heaven-and-Earth as one, blending into the formless. Thus, one shares the same body with emptiness and the same function with Heaven-and-Earth; bodily form and Dharma-body are nondual, movement and stillness, opening and closing, all proceeding with the great transformation. As the *Zhuangzi* says, \"The Dao flows through as one.\" Hence it is said: \"Only the enlightened know that all is one.\" To be \"through\" is to attain; to attain is to approach the subtle.\n\nShi Jianwu said: \"Heaven and man share the same qi; they respond and commune. Yang comes from emptiness, embracing me, the master.\" Zhang Ziqiong said: \"Heaven and man share the same qi from the beginning; only the bodily form obstructs their communion. When refinement reaches the point where form and spirit merge, one knows that form is none other than true emptiness.\" Man conceals himself in Heaven, and so Heaven and man act in unison, establishing the foundation of the myriad transformations—this is called \"Heavenly roaming.\"\n\nAs for the practice, it is simply concentrating the spirit in emptiness, interweaving heart and breath, and attaining great stillness. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"The true person dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass.\" And: \"The origin is hidden in brightness; the bodily form is concealed within.\" Confucian Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* likewise states: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss; beauty lies in returning to the root.\" Both draw from this teaching, revealing the secret of concentrating the spirit and regulating the breath beneath the pillar.\n\n---\n\n173   Guan Yin Discusses the Dao (Part Two)\nFrom the *Liezi*’s “Confucius”:\nGuan Yin said: “Within oneself, take no abode; let things manifest their forms. Still as a mirror, responsive as an echo—thus the Dao resembles things. Things depart from the Dao; the Dao does not depart from things. Those who are good at the Dao neither use the ears, nor the eyes, nor strength, nor the heart. To seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. It may appear before you, then suddenly behind; employed, it fills the six directions; discarded, none know its whereabouts. Neither those with intent nor those without can grasp it—far or near. Only those who silently attain it and let their nature perfect it can obtain it.\n\nTo know and forget emotion, to be capable yet not act—this is true knowledge, true ability. How can one have emotion if one emanates non-knowing? How can one act if one emanates non-ability? A clod of earth, a pile of dust—though they do nothing, they are not without principle.”\n\nThis wondrous discourse by Guan Yin perfectly embodies the Dao, circling within its center, illuminating past and future. It is the supreme teaching of the Mysterious School, the subtle Dao of the pillar’s simplicity and constancy. \"Within oneself, take no abode\" deeply accords with the *Diamond Sutra*’s \"abide nowhere while giving rise to the heart.\" \"Let things manifest their forms\" means clarity shines in every instance, revelation appears in every thing—what the Perfected Purple Yang called \"not a single thing is not my heart.\"\n\n\"Still as a mirror\" describes stillness that illuminates, ever illuminating without cease. As the *Zhuangzi* says: \"The mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it neither advances nor retreats, responds without storing, and thus masters things without harm.\" The mirror’s function is to reflect things without emotion: it responds to what comes and does not retain what goes. Thus, it illustrates the marvel of the perfected person’s mindless response to things.\n\n\"Their movement is like water\"—universally nourishing yet without intent. Though water moves, its moist nature remains unchanged, revealing the secret of the perfected person’s unchanging response to conditions.",

May I ask how one attains this?”\n\nGuan Yin replied, “This is the preservation of pure qi—it does not belong to the realm of cunning, skill, or boldness.”",

      "translated_text": "Kàng Cāng said, \"My body unites with the heart-mind, the heart-mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, and spirit unites with the Nothingness. When there is a presence with firm resolve or a sound with pure resonance—whether distant at the eight wilds’ edge or near within the space between brows and lashes—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this is perceived by my seven apertures and four limbs, or known by the heart, belly, and five viscera. It is simply self-knowing.\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu was greatly pleased. Another day, he told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer. (The two sages both resonated in that smile—subtle! Subtle!)\n\nThis chapter penetrates above and below, concise in words yet comprehensive in meaning, leaving nothing unencompassed, and strikes the mark with divine subtlety. The Song dynasty Chan master Yongming composed the *Zongjing lu*, which also cites this passage. In his explication of \"self-knowing,\" he states that it is the wondrous accord of the One Heart, transmitted from sage to sage—only this Dao.\n\nXuánjìng remarked: The lines \"the heart-mind unites with qi\" and so forth point to the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, forgetting the form to cultivate qi, forgetting qi to cultivate spirit, and forgetting spirit to cultivate emptiness. These three barriers of practice encompass all without omission. Truly, this is the height of simplicity and subtlety. As for \"seeing and hearing without using ears and eyes,\" it is evidence of the six senses returning to stillness and the merging of disparate natures into unity. The ancients said, \"Seeing without eyes, hearing without ears\"—this is the true realm of the Daoist adept. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"If you refrain from following the twelve conditioned states—movement and stillness, union and separation, tranquility and change, obstruction and passage, arising and ceasing, brightness and darkness—and uproot even one sense faculty, freeing it from entanglement and turning it inward to return to the original true, the radiance of its nature will shine forth. Once this luminosity is revealed, the remaining five senses will likewise be uprooted and fully liberated. Do you not know that in this assembly, Aniruddha sees without eyes; the dragon Bhadanta hears without ears; the goddess Gaṅgā perceives fragrance without a nose; the brahmin Gavāṃpati knows taste with a different tongue; the spirit Śunyatā senses touch without a body; and the śrāvaka attains quiescence. Here too, Mahākāśyapa, having long extinguished the root of thought, abides in perfect clarity, knowing without reliance on mental activity.\"\n\nThis confirms that in the cultivation of immortals and buddhas, the six senses are liberated, the dust of defilements dissolves, and awakening is perfected—there is no second Dao.\n\nAlas! Had Laozi not taken the *Yi*’s imagery as his foundation but instead followed Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Lao Dan, Guan Yin, Kàng Cāng, Zhuangzi, and Liezi to compose the *Cantong qi*, it would surely have been even more remarkable.\n\n---\n\n175. The Old Fisherman’s Angling\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"Tian Zifang\" chapter:\n\nKing Wen observed at Zāng and saw an old man angling. Yet his angling was no angling—though he held a fishing rod, he did not angle as others do, for his was the angling of constancy.

      "translated_text": "At dawn, King Wen summoned his ministers and said: “Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark-complexioned and bearded. He rode a dappled horse with one red hoof and declared: ‘Entrust your governance to the Old Fisherman of Zāng; perhaps then the people may find relief.’” The ministers, startled, exclaimed: “This was our late lord, the former king!” King Wen said: “Then let us divine his will.” The ministers replied: “The command of the former king admits no alternative—what need is there for divination?” Thereupon they welcomed the Old Fisherman of Zāng and entrusted him with governance. No statutes were altered, no decrees were issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and found: the ranks of scholars had disbanded, their factions dissolved; officials no longer cultivated virtue; measuring vessels dared not cross the four borders; and the feudal lords harbored no disloyalty. Thereupon King Wen appointed him Grand Preceptor, faced north, and inquired: “Can such governance extend to all under Heaven?” The Old Fisherman, silent and unmoved, declined with vague words. By nightfall, he had fled, vanishing without trace.\n\nXuanjing observes: The Old Fisherman of Zāng was none other than Grand Duke Wang, a man of the Dao. He feigned angling as a guise: one hand held the rod, the other watched the floating bob, his spirit gathered in emptiness, heart and breath interdependent. In a trance of indistinct reverie, he angled for something beyond the hook. Thus, though his hand grasped the rod, the rod never stirred. Angling yet not angling, not angling yet angling—how sublime! The ancients cultivated their work in every moment and place. As the Boat Monk said: *“A thousand feet of line cast deep—intent lies in the abyss. But tell me, what was the outcome?”* I cite the Boat Monk’s verse in witness:\n\n*A thousand feet of silk line hangs straight down,\nA single ripple stirs ten thousand more.\nIn still night’s chill, the fish do not bite—\nThe moonlit boat returns empty.*\n\nWhen King Wen raised the Old Fisherman to governance, the man embodied the inner sageliness and outer kingliness of the Dao. Without action, the people transformed themselves; without rewards, they strove; without words, they trusted. His governance was resplendent, surpassing even King Wen’s reach. For he moved hearts purely through the Dao, without recourse to laws or decrees. Thus, when King Wen sought to appoint him Grand Preceptor, the old man drifted away like a wild goose into the boundless sky—what archer could aspire to such heights? Truly, he came and went without trace, a divine dragon whose head appears but tail remains unseen.\n\n---\n\n176.

Prince Qingji saw this and asked: “What method did you employ?” She replied: “In the space between (embracing unity alone), I dared not impose any method. I have heard: ‘Once carved and polished, return to simplicity.’ Unknowing and unassuming, drifting in doubt, I gathered in boundless vagueness. I sent off the departing and welcomed the arriving—arrivals were not barred, departures were not hindered.”",

      "translated_text": "From their strength and vigor, following their curves and contours, yielding to their natural exhaustion—these three phrases describe the marvel of spontaneity. Thus, though levies were gathered morning and evening, not a hair was harmed; how much more so for those who tread the great thoroughfare!\n\nThe *Secret Explication* states: The *Zhuangzi* is nine-tenths parable, and this too is a parable. \"Casting bells\" is a metaphor for forming the embryo. \"Levying funds\" refers to gathering the primordial qi. \"Completed in three months\" signifies the hundred-day foundation of base-building. \"Erecting an altar beyond the outer gate\" clarifies that the empty space outside the body is the alchemical altar, the crucible and vessel positioned therein. From \"in the space between\" onward, it purely demonstrates the work. What is meant by \"in the space between\"? It is the principle of guarding the center and embracing unity, the practice of concentrating spirit and regulating breath. When heart and breath harmonize, the two realms converge, merging into one—this alone is the task. \"Return to simplicity\" means that, through prolonged stabilization of spirit and qi, thoughts and breath are both forgotten, returning to chaos. \"Unknowing and unassuming, drifting in doubt, gathering in boundless vagueness\" describes a state of utter oblivion, profound stillness. \"Sending off the departing and welcoming the arriving\" means the heart follows the breath: one breath departs, one breath arrives, heart and breath cling to each other. \"Following, yielding, relying\"—these three words exhaust the subtleties of breath regulation. Since ancient times, no one discussing breath regulation has surpassed this three-word secret. In a single phrase: simply follow nature. Gathering in the morning and levying in the evening, primordial yang accumulates daily, yet my body and heart remain unmoved, profoundly settled. Through stillness, one responds without sensing toil, so not a hair is harmed. The concluding lines are even more marvelous: \"the great thoroughfare\" refers to the divine continent of the Red Region, the empty space outside the body. Dwelling in the world’s great thoroughfare, treading the Dao with ease—what affair could remain unresolved? Mencius said: \"Dwell in the world’s broadest abode, stand in the world’s correct position, walk the world’s great Way.\" This truly aligns with the marvelous principle of the great thoroughfare. Sima Ziwei said: \"The empty void, a single aperture called the Mysterious Pass, lies between heaven and earth in the human body. Vastly encompassing the Dharma Realm without trace, subtly entering dust motes unseen.\" Luo Gongyuan said: \"A single aperture of emptiness amid heaven and earth, entwined and secret, impervious to wind.\" All reveal the secret of \"the great thoroughfare.\"\n\n---\n\n177. Confucius’ Admirable Retreat\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*, \"Mountain Trees\" chapter:\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren came to offer condolences, saying: \"Were you nearly dead?\" Confucius replied: \"Yes.\" \"Do you detest death?\" \"Yes.\" Ren said: \"Let me speak of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called the *yidai*. As a bird, it is leisurely and unhurried, appearing incapable. It flies only when aided and roosts only when pressed. Advancing, it dares not take the lead; retreating, it dares not lag behind. In eating, it dares not taste first but must take the remnants. Thus, it is never expelled from the flock, and outsiders never harm it, so it avoids disaster. The straightest trees are felled first; the sweetest wells are drained first. You, in your intent, adorn knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose impurity, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride—how could you escape harm? Long ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast achieve no merit; those who complete merit fall; those who achieve fame suffer loss.' Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the multitude? The Dao flows but does not dwell in brightness; virtue acts but does not reside in renown. Pure and constant, one resembles the mad. Erasing traces, relinquishing power, one does not pursue merit or fame. Thus, one bears no blame from others, and others bear none from them. The perfected person remains unknown—why do you delight in this?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent!\" He parted from his associates, left his disciples, and fled to the great marshes. Clad in furs and coarse cloth, eating acorns and chestnuts, he entered the beasts’ midst without disrupting their herds, entered the birds’ midst without disturbing their flocks. Birds and beasts did not detest him—how much less would humans!\n\nThe *Explication* states: This passage uses Confucius to expound a lesson, urging those who cultivate the Dao to relinquish thoughts of merit and profit, blend with the world, avoid standing out to alarm others, and refrain from seeking fame to exalt themselves. Serene and detached, indifferent and remote—only thus can one preserve the body and avoid harm. Yang Yinxiou said: \"Zhuangzi’s 'pure and constant' is Laozi’s 'simple and dull'—Zhuangzi inherited Laozi’s teachings, forming a distinct school.\" Gui Zhenchuan said: \"Riding the Dao to wander through the world, appearing wise or foolish, one must shed burdens and empty oneself, embrace simplicity and adaptability, relinquish merit and fame, abandon social circles, accept poverty and follow one’s lot, neither chasing things nor priding oneself—this is the way to preserve the body and avoid harm.\" Lu Fanghu said: \"The Dao flows without dwelling in brightness—from ancient times to the present, day and night pass like this, silently operating without ever declaring itself as Dao. This is the Dao’s marvel. Those who embody the Dao, dwelling in attainment without attachment, approach it. 'Attainment' means achieving one’s will. 'Residing in renown' refers to self-display and self-boasting. 'Pure' means singular; 'constant' means ordinary. To unify the heart and make conduct ordinary is to resemble the recklessly mad. Thus, it is said: 'one resembles the mad.' Erasing traces means shutting the door and sweeping away tracks, leaving no wheel ruts behind.\"",

      "translated_text": "To relinquish power means neither serving kings and lords nor engaging in persuasive speech. Thus, one does not establish merit for the world or fame for all ages, nor does one seek perfection from others—therefore, others cannot demand perfection in virtue from them. Such conduct, seeking neither recognition nor prominence, belongs to those who leave no trace. I observe that practitioners of the Dao are often slandered by the vulgar, half of which stems from self-display. Scholars must therefore discard ornamentation and embrace plainness, merging indistinguishably with the great unity. They should act in hidden subtlety, leaving no trace, seeking only self-knowledge rather than worldly renown—only then can they transcend free of encumbrance. This point is of utmost importance, hence its inclusion here. If one can depart from the dust of the world, retreat into the great marshes or beneath cliffs and ravines, dwelling in thatched huts or stone chambers in tranquil seclusion, utterly cut off from the world, it would be even better.\n\n---\n\n**178.

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui’s sitting-in-forgetfulness is an effortless entry into samādhi. When samādhi endures, inner and outer become utterly forgotten—this is the most wondrous and profound state. \"Leaving form\" means the body is emptied; \"dismissing knowledge\" means the mind is emptied. When body and mind, inner and outer, are all empty, one’s hidden self leaves no trace, and the entire dharma-realm manifests. Thus it concludes with \"merging with the Great Thoroughfare\"—this is precisely the moment of realizing the equality of dharmatā.\n\nLu Pingquan said, “Sitting-in-forgetfulness is the Chan school’s ‘facing the wall.’” Sima Ziwei said, “Sitting-in-forgetfulness is the foundation of long life. Thus, one summons the true to refine the form, and when the form is purified, it unites with qi. One embraces the Dao to refine qi, and when qi is purified, it unites with spirit. When the body and the Dao become one, this is called attaining the Dao. The true is the dwelling place of the Dao. Therefore, one calms the spirit to align with the true.”\n\nZhuangzi said, *“When the universe is at peace and settled, it emits celestial radiance.”* The “universe” is the mind; “celestial radiance” is the illumination of wisdom. When the mind is first settled, wisdom shines forth from within, illuminating the emptiness of all phenomena. The mind then merges with stillness—this is called sitting-in-forgetfulness.\n\nI say that in the profound tradition of sitting-in-forgetfulness, the subtlety lies in the dual settling of mind and breath. From settling, one forgets; spirit and qi return to their root, and the embryo of the Dao takes form. Within this lies boundless celestial mechanism. As Cao Wenyu said, *“Merge into one and then forget the one—thus may one emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.”* If one merely practices withered Chan, it is no different from sitting while distracted—this is not sitting-in-forgetfulness.\n\n**Liezi Riding the Wind**\nIn the *Zhuangzi*’s “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter, it says, *“Liezi rode the wind and traveled, soaring lightly and gracefully.

      "translated_text": "The in-and-out breath of us humans is none other than the *wind element*; with spirit guiding qi, heart and breath interpenetrate—proceeding thus to the state of *great samādhi* is the true practice of \"riding the wind.\" Liezi further states: *\"When the heart congeals and form dissolves, bones and flesh wholly fuse. One no longer senses where the body leans or where the feet tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or husk, utterly unaware whether the wind bears me or I ride the wind!\"* This is the merging of heart and breath into oneness, where one no longer knows whether spirit depends on breath or breath on spirit. As spirit and breath fuse, they enter together into the realm of *huanghu* and *yaoming*, the state of *xiyi* and *great samādhi*—this is the esoteric purport of Zhuangzi’s *Free and Easy Wandering* and the true essence of Liezi’s \"riding the wind.\" The \"fifteen days\" symbolize the first half-month up to the full moon as the phase for *advancing the fire*, requiring the *xun* wind to stir it. After fifteen days, the yang tide naturally recedes, so one must *retreat the talisman* to correspond with it. Master Cuixu said: *\"When spirit and qi merge in darkness and qi returns, bones and flesh fuse in harmony—one knows it not.\"* Hence, \"bones and flesh wholly fuse.\"\n\nThe perfected adept, possessing the *spiritual power of swiftness*, roams the ten directions—wherever the mind wills, there they arrive. What need have they for wind? Thus, the wind Liezi rides is none other than the *breath-wind*, the essential technique of guiding qi with spirit and the profound purport of the harmonious fusion of heart and breath.\n\n**Changfang’s Earth-Shrinking**\nThe *Biographies of Divine Immortals* records that Fei Changfang possessed divine arts and could contract the earth’s veins, bringing a thousand *li* into immediate view as if before one’s eyes, then restoring them to their original expanse. This *earth-shrinking* method, if considered in light of the unobstructed spiritual powers of immortals and buddhas, allows one to compress thousands of *li* into a foot’s span or eons into a single instant—time and spatial measure may be extended or contracted at will, without hindrance. Such principles are entirely credible. As the heart is free, so too is the Dharma.\n\nDelving into its esoteric meaning, it is truly the purport of heart and breath depending on each other, spirit and breath merging in secrecy. Through this mutual dependence, the in-and-out breath shortens from long, then from long to short, until it vanishes—is this not the image of *earth-shrinking*? Some may ask: If so, then is the earth’s vein equated with the in-and-out breath? What proof is there? The answer: Heart and breath are the yin and yang of the human person, the heaven and earth of the body. In the *Book of Changes*, they are *Qian* and *Kun*; in the human, they are body and mind. The heart is spirit; the body is qi. Thus, the image of *earth-shrinking* is the image of *revolving the breath to return to the origin*, the dissolution of breath into emptiness. When the heart unites with the breath, the breath’s extension and contraction also become free, expanding and contracting in perfect measure—this is the alternating use of *civil fire* and *martial fire*.\n\nZhou Jichang’s *Daoist Songs* states: *\"Who knows the wondrous art of mending heaven? Who understands the marvel of shrinking earth?\"* Master Yuchan’s *Breath-Regulation Formula* says: *\"In regulating the breath’s fire-timing, there is the *gathering breath*. The heart must be able to empty and humble itself, then essence can enter the crucible—this is called the *earth-shrinking* method.\"* This may mutually verify the present explanation.\n\n**Nüwa Mends Heaven**",

When *Kan* and *Li* invert to become *Qian* and *Kun*, the sunken metal rises, and the floating wood descends. The reverse application of the Five Phases hinges solely on this central inversion.\n\nThe alchemical method of *drawing from Kan to fill Li* originated with Nüwa. Without doubt, Nüwa’s elixir method was taught to her by her brother Fuxi. In activity, it is Fuxi; in stillness, it is Nüwa—are they not the primal ancestors of the Mysterious Tradition? The origins of Daoist learning are profoundly ancient, as this may attest.\n\nNüwa’s smelting of stones to mend the heavens and Zhuangzi’s *roc bird soaring southward* both embody the image of *drawing from Kan to fill Li* to restore the *Qian* body. In terms of practice, it does not extend beyond the mutual dependence of heart and breath.\n\n---\n\n**Shu Ao Regulates the Breath**\nIn *Zhuangzi·Tian Zifang*, Jian Wu asked Sunshu Ao: “You have thrice served as Prime Minister without pride, and thrice been dismissed without sorrow. At first, I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils breathing freely—how do you cultivate your heart-mind?”\n\nSunshu Ao replied: “How do I surpass others? I accept what comes without refusal and do not cling to what departs. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so remain free of sorrow. How do I surpass others?”",

The heart must be able to empty and humble itself, then essence can enter the crucible—this is called the *earth-shrinking* method.\"* This may mutually verify the present explanation.\n\n**Nüwa Mends Heaven**",

      "translated_text": "Thus, over time, Changfang remained unwavering in his devotion, never daring to make any requests (beholding the sincerity of ancients in seeking a master, truly worthy of emulation). Hugong, recognizing Changfang’s steadfast faith, said to him, “Come again at dusk when no one is about.” Changfang followed his instruction and returned, whereupon they leapt together into the gourd. Once inside, he no longer perceived it as a mere gourd but beheld instead a world of immortals’ palaces—towers and layered gates, covered walkways and halls, fine wine and delicacies filling the space. They drank together, then emerged.\n\nLater, when Hugong prepared to depart, Changfang followed him into the mountains to study the Dao. This episode is most wondrous, revealing its meaning both openly and subtly. The gourd symbolizes the mysterious aperture of the *xuanguan*, the very essence of “guarding the center”—a realm of emptiness beyond the body. Leaping into it with one’s form is to concentrate the spirit in the void. Retreating and concealing oneself within the gourd, spirit and breath intermingle, gradually harmonizing, gradually settling, until the physical form dissolves, and the primordial *yuan-yang* true *qi* of pre-heaven permeates and nourishes the body, suffusing it with a soft, blissful ease, as if intoxicated by the warmth of spring—an ineffable delight. This is the profound significance of the gourd containing another heaven.\n\n*The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states:\n*“The pre-heavenly qi, the post-heavenly breath—*\n*Those who attain it ever seem drunk.”*\nThis is the meaning of their shared intoxication and satiety.\n\nThus, Master Sanfeng said:\n*“Who knows the vastness of heaven and earth in stillness?*\n*I love the long days and months within the gourd.”*\nAnd again:\n*“Knowing only the realm of heaven and earth within the gourd,*\n*Who recalls the passing years of the human world?”*\nAnd:\n*“A single night of diligent refinement below—*\n*Within the gourd, a thousand years of days and months.”*\n\nLü Zu said:\n*“Wind and clouds of the grotto return to my grasp,*\n*The days and months of the gourd rest in my breast.”*\nAnd:\n*“The world’s cycles of sixty years cannot bind,*\n*Within the gourd, heaven and earth are free.”*\nAnd:\n*“Beyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are my companions;*\n*Within the gourd, sun and moon are ever fair.”*\nAnd:\n*“Qi returns, the elixir forms of itself,*\n*Within the gourd, Kan and Li unite.”*\n\nLongmei Zi said:\n*“Endless transformations of life and creation—*\n*All manifest as a grotto-heaven within the gourd.”*\n\nChen Cuixu said:\n*“Within, there is a true gourd-heaven,*\n*Where wind and light are bright, the moon pure.”*\nAnd:\n*“Though the seas may turn to mulberry fields,*\n*Within my Dao, not a year has passed in the gourd.”*\n\nBai Yuchan said:\n*“The heart enters emptiness, practicing the fire times;*\n*Inner and outer scenes—heaven within the gourd.”*\nAnd:\n*“Beyond the body, seek within the body;*\n*Harmonious, vital qi—a spring within the gourd.”*\nAnd:\n*“A carefree, idle man,*\n*His hut holds a gourd of spring.”*\n\nTang Guangzhen said:\n*“When the day comes that the elixir is formed,*\n*Drunk within the gourd, no need for support.”*\n\nCangming Zi said:\n*“Within the gourd, every scene is present,*\n*Yin and yang rise and fall by their own measure.”*\n\nAll these describe the inner vision of withdrawing into the gourd, harmonizing the breath, merging spirit and *qi*, the true *qi* flowing like clouds, wearing flowers and drinking wine—carefree and at ease. The profound principle of the gourd-heaven is most wondrous. To resolve the question of human existence and transcend the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, nothing but this gourd-heaven will suffice. Qiu Zu’s Daoist name, Changchun (“Ever-Spring”), deeply grasped the secret of the gourd-heaven.\n\nMaster Gui’an of Yu’an said:\n*“Entering through the gate, one finds not the family treasure;*\n*Beyond, there is the gourd’s heaven and earth of spring.”*\nEven Chan Buddhism praises the gourd-heaven. Yet in recent times, Chan monasteries cling to withered Chan, cold ashes and dead wood, utterly devoid of vitality—clearly not the true intent of the Western Patriarch.\n\n**184. The Queen Mother Cultivates Peaches**\n*The Comprehensive Mirror of Divine Transcendents* details the grandeur of the Peach Assembly. Immortals raise their cups, reveling amidst seas and mountains—how the heart yearns for such a scene! The *pantao* peaches are cultivated by the Queen Mother of the West, ripening but once every three thousand years. Yet Dongfang Shuo is said to have stolen them. In Zhang Sanfeng’s *Lyrics of the Rootless Tree*, he writes:\n*“Entering the immortal court, bold of spirit,*\n*I stole the peaches of the Queen Mother of Yao Pond.”*\nThough couched in allegory, this holds a profound secret. The Queen Mother embodies *Kun*, the image of Laozi’s “attaining emptiness and guarding stillness.” The peach symbolizes the primordial *qi*. The ancestral *qi* of pre-heaven must rely on *Kun*-earth to take form. As *Awakening to Reality* says, “Depending on the position of *Kun*, the body is formed.” *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states:\n*“Born in Kun, planted in Qian.”*\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\n*“The eldest son inherits the father’s body,*\n*By the mother, the foundation is laid.”*\nThe *Book of Changes*’ *Kun* hexagram reads:\n*“In the southwest, one finds companions.”*\nAll these describe the same image.",

      "translated_text": "The peach ripens once every three thousand years—three being the generative number of wood—thus the peach embodies the image of *Zhen*. The Queen Mother represents the image of *Kun*; when she plants the peach and reaps the peach, above *Kun* and below *Zhen* form the hexagram *Fu*, the image of *\"Thunder quakes beneath the earth, and the yellow sprout emerges from the soil.\"* This is also what is meant by *\"From emptiness and stillness, white snow is born; from silence, the yellow sprout arises.\"*\n\nDongfang Shuo entered the Queen Mother’s peach garden and stole the peaches, which is to say, within the moving lines of the *Fu* hexagram, he gathered the primordial ancestral *qi* and returned it to the earthen crucible. As *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"Recognizing the call, he brings it home to nourish.\"*\n\nDongfang Shuo and the Queen Mother naturally stand opposite as east and west. First, he enters from the east into the west, then returns from the west back to the east. *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The Metal Duke is originally the son of the eastern household, sent to the western neighbor to lodge and take form.\"* In *Journey to the West*, Sun Wukong is born in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body, travels to the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift to study the Dao, and later returns to Flower-Fruit Mountain.

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* states: *\"When qi harmonizes with supreme harmony, attaining the One, the Dao is wholly at peace. Harmony itself is no single harmony—its profound principle merges with the boundless.\"* The *Scripture of the Heart Seal* says: *\"Supreme harmony overflows, bones scattering like cold jade.\"*\n\nIn the cultivation and realization of the profound mystery, heart and breath merge in wondrous union, water and fire blend as one, inner and outer harmonize alike. With the harmony of the entire body, one resonates with the harmony of heaven and earth, the surging harmony pervading all, vast and inexhaustible. Thus, the *Triple Concordance Canon* declares:\n\n*\"Dripping like vernal rain,\nFlowing like melting ice,\nFrom head to foot it streams,\nThen ascends once more,\nCoursing through the infinite,\nPervading all within.\"*\n\nShi Xinglin says:\n*\"Clouds disperse, revealing the crabapple moon,\nSpring deepens with the willow’s breeze.\nWho knows this meaning?\nI lift my eyes to ask the empty sky.\"*\n\nThis is the wondrous realm of supreme harmony, where phoenix and simurgh sing in unison. Here, the embryo of the Dao may be perfected, mortal form transformed. By bathing body and mind in its purity, desire’s fire is stilled and the five spirits grow serene; by nurturing the root-source, yin qi dissolves and the hundred bones align. Gathered, the five qi ascend to the origin; dispersed, they fill the five viscera. No greater art of nurturing life exists, and within it lies the fullness of longevity.\n\nThe ancient sage said: *\"To know harmony is to know constancy.\"* Liezi declared: *\"The waxing and waning of the one body all communicate with heaven and earth, resonating with the ten thousand kinds. Harmonious at the beginning, harmonious at the end—still the spirit, extinguish thought, and therein lies the Way of life.\"* Such is the subtlety of advancing in the profound mystery.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFrom cinnabar peaks, phoenix and simurgh alight in the jade tower,\nIn the secret hall, the *Xiaoshao* hymn plays its nine movements.\nThe rustic elder knows not the honor of the imperial carriage,\nYet through the six streets still echoes the sound of the silent whip.\n\n**186. Beyond the One Hue**\nIn the practice of the profound mystery, when one reaches the state of utter supreme harmony, a single hue, the work of nine returns and seven reversals is already accomplished. Ascending further, the very void shatters, effortlessly transcending all, abiding neither in the one hue nor in the mysterious wondrous. Freed from the body, without reliance—only then is it called \"transcending the norm.\"\n\nThus, the ancient worthies said: *\"When the one hue dissolves, only then is it called noble. Shifting one’s step in subtlety, the crane escapes the silver cage. Turning within the station, the moon spreads gold upon the earth.\"* Dongshan remarked: *\"White powder cannot conceal traces, Chang’an is no place for long abiding.\"* For though Chang’an is fine, it is not a home for lingering. Turning to the next station, not dwelling in nobility, one naturally cannot be confined.\n\nIf one clings to the edge of the one hue, to the station of purity, one still falls into the rut—how could this accord with the supreme mystery of the Dao?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHaving grasped the principle of emptiness,\nOne follows illumination to forget the nature.\nUnless merit and power are exhausted,\nHow can one avoid awaiting the Empty King?\n\n(*The Heavenly Music Collection* concludes)\n\n**Appendix: Six Texts**",

      "translated_text": "**Appendix I: Responses to Ten Questions from Gentleman Tang Muxuan**\n**By the Hermit of Haiyin Mountain**\n\n**1. On the Stages of Learning the Dao—Please Outline the General Framework.**\n**Answer:** The stages of learning the Dao may be summarized in four steps: faith, understanding, practice, and realization. This is the broad outline.\n\nFaith is the first step, and understanding the second. Faith must be deep, and understanding must be thorough. For example, if one resolves to journey to Wudang Mountain in Hubei to pay homage, one must firmly believe in the existence of the Taihe immortal realm and the possibility of reaching it. Understanding means clearly grasping the route—knowing the land and water paths, as well as the conditions for food and lodging along the way—and preparing sufficient travel funds. Practice entails personally traversing the terrain, advancing according to the predetermined route. Realization is attained upon reaching the destination, where one abides in freedom and enjoys the fullness of the Way. Realization has varying depths, but liberation is the ultimate goal. Until liberation is achieved, one remains in the stage of practice and cannot be said to have entered realization.\n\nBy \"liberation,\" I mean transcending the Five Turbidities, surpassing the Three Realms, and escaping both the segmental and transformative forms of birth and death. For beginners, faith and understanding are urgent tasks. Once practice begins and understanding is transcended, realization becomes the ultimate aim.\n\n**2. On the Stages of Cultivating the Dao—Please Also Outline the General Framework.**\n**Answer:** Tanzi’s *Book of Transformations* states: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi; forget qi to nourish spirit; forget spirit to nourish emptiness. When emptiness and reality interpenetrate, this is called Great Harmony.\"* This is the general framework of the stages.\n\nThus, Master Bai said: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi, and qi transforms into spirit—this is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.\"* Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it has been commonly said: *\"Refine essence into qi, refine qi into spirit, refine spirit to return to emptiness.\"* However, this is not as all-encompassing as Master Tan’s teaching.\n\n**3. Today, many study the Dao, but none are heard to have attained it. Where lies the crux of the problem? Can you point it out?**\n**Answer:** \"Studying the Dao\" is a general term. Among those who use it, some are sincere in their pursuit, aiming to transcend birth and death; others seek fame and profit, using it as a pretense; some follow along temporarily but soon abandon it, beginning without perseverance; and others blindly follow false teachers, practicing without guidance. All call themselves Dao-seekers, but most do not align with the Dao.\n\nLet us focus on those who genuinely study the Dao to transcend birth and death: some encounter true teachers, while others do not; some receive complete instructions from true teachers, while others only learn preliminary practices or obtain only half the method. Even among those who are sincere, have met true teachers, and received complete instructions, some face various obstacles that hinder their practice; others procrastinate until their allotted time runs out, leaving no opportunity for cultivation; and some are able to let go of everything, advancing without hindrance—these are those whose virtue is sufficient and whose Dao is complete, thus fulfilling their aspirations.\n\nGenerally, cultivating the Dao must be supported by virtue. Those lacking in virtue often encounter demonic obstacles when attempting to practice. I have witnessed this many times. For example, if you have long resided in an inn, accumulating unpaid debts for room and board, you may continue staying without immediate reckoning. But if you decide to leave for elsewhere, the innkeeper and attendants will demand a full settlement of all accounts before allowing you to depart. This world within the Three Realms is like an inn where we have lodged for kalpas, accruing countless karmic debts from past lives. If you vow to transcend birth and death and leave the Three Realms, all past karmic debts must be settled at once—otherwise, there will be no future opportunity for repayment. This is why, in *Journey to the West*, the moment Tang Monk vows to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven, eighty-one tribulations arise. Few attain the Dao, half due to not meeting true teachers, and half due to their own procrastination or karmic obstructions.\n\n**4. Should those who study immortality eat meat or abstain from it? If one studies Buddhism, the teachings are explicit—this is not an issue. However, alchemical texts contain no precepts mandating vegetarianism for Dao cultivators. Conversely, Master Sanfeng said: *\"Drink wine, eat meat, yet keep a vegetarian’s diet of wine and meat in the belly.\"* He also told Layman Wang: *\"For those who abstain from meat, I say: ‘A kind heart surpasses a kind mouth; it suffices to follow the gentleman’s teaching to stay far from the kitchen.’\"* The *Daoist Ballad* states: *\"Do not abstain from meat or commit lust, for lust forfeits the treasure of long life; wine and meat pass through the intestines, but the Dao resides in the heart.\"* This clearly permits meat-eating.\n\nYet I wonder: why does Buddhism enforce precepts while Daoism relaxes them? Are their teachings so divergent? Do you eat meat or abstain? On this matter, what insights can you offer to guide later learners?**\n**Answer:** In my work *Random Notes on the Treasures of the Dao*, there is a discussion on the meat-eating question. When I have time, I will excerpt and submit it for publication in this journal. This issue pertains to the cultivation of virtue.\n\nWe who practice the Dao are descendants of the ancient sages and must naturally adhere to the ancestral teachings. Among the Three Treasures of the ancient sages, compassion is foremost. It is said: *\"Thus the sage constantly excels in saving beings, and so abandons none.\"* And: *\"Heaven will save them, with compassion as their defense.\"* Because people eat meat, nets are cast in the mountains and forests, and traps are set in the depths of waters. Oxen and sheep, large creatures, and fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs, small ones, are captured and slaughtered without respite.",

      "translated_text": "Just ask yourself: does this accord with the ancient sages’ principle of *\"great compassion as foremost\"* and their teaching of *\"constantly excelling in saving beings\"*? If you admire and emulate the sages’ way of *\"long life and enduring vision\"* yet reject and discard their injunctions to *\"practice great compassion, save all beings, and remain tranquil and free from desire,\"* then you become self-serving and profit-seeking, turning your back on the sages and betraying the Dao. In such a case, your virtue will be insufficient, and you will find it difficult to attain immortality.\n\nIf you truly desire long life, you must also wish for every being to enjoy long life and fulfill its true nature. Only then will you align with the spirit of great compassion. Among those who have eloquently discussed immortality, none surpass *Baopuzi*. In its second scroll, *\"On Immortality,\"* it states: *\"The method of learning immortality requires tranquility, joy, and detachment, cleansing oneself of cravings and desires.\"* It further says: *\"The Dao of immortality demands love extended even to creeping insects, never harming any sentient being.\"* And again: *\"The Dao of immortality requires abstaining from foul and rank foods, fasting to purify the intestines.\"*\n\nIn *\"Subtle Principles,\"* it declares: *\"Those who seek long life must accumulate merit, cultivate compassion toward all beings, extend empathy to others, and show kindness even to insects.\"* All these teachings align perfectly with the *Daodejing*. Yet if one kills beings to nourish oneself, how far does this stray from the precepts of *\"kindness extended to insects, love extended to creeping things, never harming sentient beings\"*? And how far does it depart from the admonition to *\"cleanse oneself of cravings and desires\"*?\n\nMaster Sanfeng said: *\"A kind heart surpasses kind words; embody the noble person’s teaching to distance oneself from the kitchen.\"* He continues: *\"Nurturing qi naturally nourishes the body; one should follow the perfected person’s prohibition against foul odors.\"* This clearly shows that harmonious food suffices to nourish the five viscera, rendering unnecessary the *Inner Canon*’s dictum that *\"those deficient in essence should supplement it with flavors.\"*\n\nThe *\"perfected person’s prohibition against foul odors\"* means abstaining from meat, as the *Analects* states: *\"Food of displeasing color or foul odor is not eaten.\"* Between mouth and heart, a kind heart is naturally superior to kind words.

      "translated_text": "I observe that Master Feng’s words are boundlessly harmonious, yet you cling only to his opening line while neglecting what follows—this becomes a one-sided view. The phrase *\"wine and meat pass through the intestines, but the Dao resides in the heart\"* should be weighed by its final three characters. Today’s people let wine and meat fill their bellies while their hearts remain devoid of the Dao, indulging only in flavors and yielding to the five desires. Their state is worlds apart from Master Sanfeng’s realm, so one cannot seize upon this line to raise objections.\n\nIn essence, both immortals and buddhas prize a pure and tranquil heart. If the mouth craves fish and meat, the eyes will crave the five colors, and the ears will crave the five sounds. Dwelling daily amid the realm of the five desires, one risks losing resonance with the pure heart. Moreover, killing living beings accumulates karmic enmity: if I harm others, they will seek to harm me in turn. Cause and effect circulate without the slightest deviation. We who cultivate the Dao must urgently clear our past debts and lighten our karmic obstructions—how can we incur new ones?\n\nI myself began studying the Dao at nineteen, eating meat as circumstances allowed. Not until twenty-seven did I encounter *The Myriad Goodnesses Resource Collection* by Zhou Anshi of the early Qing—a most excellent book. After reading it repeatedly, a heart of compassion arose spontaneously within me. I realized that killing to sustain one’s own life contradicts the great compassionate principle, harms heavenly harmony, depletes hidden virtue, and violates the benevolent teachings of Confucius and Laozi. It was time to change course.\n\nYet old habits die hard. After a few days of vegetarianism, cravings for meat returned. Adapting to the circumstances, I alternated between meat and vegetarian meals, while ceasing to kill any living beings—no fish, shrimp, or other creatures were purchased. Whenever I had spare money each month, I bought animals to release in acts of liberation. After more than a year of this practice, I finally adopted a pure vegetarian diet, which I have maintained for seventeen or eighteen years now.\n\nBoth immortals and buddhas triumph through a heart of compassion, seeing all beings as oneself. Ancient legends speak of the Compassionate Immortal and the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering. If you take compassion as your guiding principle, then abstaining from meat and refraining from killing will pose no difficulty. How can you doubt this simply because it is absent from the immortals’ scriptures?\n\nConfucius said: *\"Loyalty and forbearance are not far from the Dao. What you do not wish for yourself, do not impose upon others.\"* Zengzi said: *\"The Master’s Dao consists solely of loyalty and forbearance.\"* Setting aside profound theories, the proverb says: *\"Put yourself in another’s place.\"* If you do not wish to be harmed or killed, yet daily wield blades against defenseless creatures, this is a failure of forbearance. The ancient sages taught compassion and protection, yet you turn your back on them, slaughtering lives to fill your belly—this is a failure of loyalty.\n\nAll creatures, however humble, possess sentience. This sentience is no different in essence from that of a sage who has attained the fruit. To destroy sentient beings is to lack benevolence. Thus, this matter bears profoundly on the cultivation of virtue. If you claim that one whose humanity is incomplete can still attain the immortal Dao, I remain skeptical.\n\n**Five:** What distinguishes the cultivation and realization of immortals and buddhas?\n**Answer:** After all, water flows eastward to the sea; in the end, clouds must seek their mountain home.\n\n**Six:** How do the attainments of immortals and buddhas compare in superiority?\n**Answer:** When clouds settle, every home has its moon; when spring arrives, every tree blooms with flowers.\n\n**Seven:** Does studying immortality hinder worldly engagement? Does worldly engagement hinder the study of immortality?\n**Answer:** Dense bamboo does not obstruct flowing water; how can high mountains block the flight of white clouds?\n\n**Eight:** What constitutes the family style of a Daoist?\n**Answer:** Walk with unhurried steps, speak in a low voice, attend to each breath, and distance the heart from thoughts. Only when you cast off all ties and return to the mountains will true freedom and ease manifest.\n\n**Nine:** You must have read many alchemical texts—with which do you most resonate?\n**Answer:** *The Collected Works of Master Bai*.\n\n**Ten:** Regarding *The Seventeen Daoist Books*, are they orthodox or heterodox?\n**Answer:** One who has wandered through the Dragon Canon will naturally discern at a glance. But if one was born in a thatched hut, let them be dazzled by the five colors. The worst is like Zhu Bajie eating the ginseng fruit—swallowing it whole and then asking what it tasted like! Never mind the taste—why must the ginseng fruit grow in the Wuzhuang Temple? What is the Wuzhuang Temple? What is the ginseng fruit?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix II: Five Letters in Reply to a Friend**\n**By Haiyin Mountain Man**\n**First Letter**\n\nWang Menglou of the Qing devoted his life to Buddhist study, then turned to immortality in his eighties, exchanging poems with immortals. Your letter asks, *\"Why descend in old age?\"*—this is a misunderstanding. The study of the Dao aims to resolve the three sufferings of old age, sickness, and death. At eighty, one is already aged: vitality wanes, steps falter, and eating becomes difficult. Hearing and sight lose their acuity; hair turns white, the face wrinkles, and death draws near.",

      "translated_text": "At such a time, if someone could relieve one’s immediate suffering, the heart would gladly follow. This is the natural inclination of human nature. Menglou had a deep affinity for Chan, yet in his exchanges with immortals, they must have transmitted to him arts for prolonging life and dispelling illness—methods for regulating breath and calming the spirit—so that he might attain true benefit and resolve the vexations of old age and sickness. While the Buddha’s teachings are lofty, many discuss its principles, but few have realized them in practice. To claim that the sufferings of old age and sickness cannot be resolved, yet the suffering of death can; or that one cannot attain sagehood in this life, but can after death—these are nothing but self-deception and deceiving others.\n\nThe Daoist tradition values only the present moment: if one can calm the spirit and harmonize the breath to gain true benefit, the future will reveal itself without inquiry. Thus, the Daoist path is like a merchant acquiring goods—demanding immediate payment, not promissory notes, and disdaining credit. Today’s Buddhists, however, seek future rewards, rebirth after death, all relying on promissory notes. Yet when the note comes due, whether it can be honored remains uncertain. The proverb says, *\"Rejecting cash in hand for credit\"*—this perfectly captures the mindset of most Buddhists today.\n\nHave you not read the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, the earliest Buddhist text translated into Chinese? The Buddha asked how long a person’s life lasts, and none of his disciples’ answers satisfied him. Finally, one replied, *\"It lasts but a single breath.\"* The Buddha praised him, saying he understood the Way. What does this mean? How is breath related to the Dao? Know this: where breath resides, the Dao resides. Since life exists in the space between breaths, why not, before the breath ceases, calm the spirit and regulate the breath to avoid bankruptcy? If one waits until the breath is cut off, the cash is already spent. Even with a promissory note, where can it be redeemed? How can one bear to wait for bankruptcy—is this not delusion?\n\n**Second Letter**\n\nYour letter says that *\"life lasts but a single breath\"* merely illustrates its brevity—*\"the incoming breath does not guarantee the outgoing.\"* My brother, you have grasped only half of it. If the Buddha meant only to speak of brevity, he would have said, *\"Excellent! You understand time,\"* not *\"Excellent! You understand the Way.\"* Clearly, this is not a matter of time.\n\nThe Dao resides in the space between breaths—this is the meaning of *\"regulating breath and calming the spirit.\"* Breath is the wind-like aspect of the heart-mind. When breath is regulated, the heart-mind is settled; when breath is harmonious, the heart-mind is at peace. When one is enraged, the heart-mind rages, and the breath grows coarse. During a race, the heart-mind races, and the breath becomes short. The dead have no breath because the heart-mind has departed; the heart-mind in samadhi has no breath because it is quiescent. Thus, from having breath to regulating it until there is no breath—when external respiration ceases entirely—then the heart-mind has no arising or ceasing. With no arising or ceasing of the heart-mind, no inhalation or exhalation of breath, the state of great samadhi emerges, and the Dao abides there.\n\nHave you not seen the words of Prajñātāra, the twenty-seventh patriarch of Chan, in reply to the King of East India? He said: *\"This poor monk’s exhalation does not follow the myriad conditions; his inhalation does not dwell in the skandhas. Constantly turning the sutra thus for hundreds of thousands of millions of volumes—not merely one or two.\"* Prajñātāra took the regulation of inhalation and exhalation as the turning of the sutra—turning the sutra of one’s own body, not another’s. When spirit and breath are harmoniously blended, continuous yet imperceptible, the inner landscape is pure and still, the outer world empty and merged—is this not what is meant by *\"exhalation does not follow the myriad conditions, inhalation does not dwell in the skandhas\"*? This is the practice Laozi described as *\"focusing qi to attain suppleness, embracing the soul and holding to the One.\"*\n\nTurning another’s sutra brings great merit, but turning the sutra of one’s own true breath brings even greater merit. Turning the sutra of written words brings great merit, but turning the sutra of wordless truth brings even greater merit. Yet people abandon the near to seek the far, crave the lofty but neglect the practical. If one cannot even master a single breath, how can one speak of anything else?\n\nToday, there are millions of Buddhists, yet all disregard the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, dismissing it as too simple. The meaning of *\"life lasts but a single breath\"* eludes them entirely. They vainly hope to attain Buddhahood in this very body, yet possess not a shred of the capital required—like a pauper with not a single coin dreaming of becoming the owner of Yong’an Xianshi, the grandest amusement company before Liberation. How absurd!\n\nThe *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections* is the first step in Buddhist practice. Establishing the Dao within the space between breaths is its very essence. The Daoist *Huangting Jing* says: *\"Behind lies the secret chamber, before the gate of life; sun emerges, moon enters—breath abides.\"* Chen Xubai said: *\"Breath comes and goes without interruption; the sacred embryo is perfected, returning to the primordial.\"* Xu Jinyang said: *\"Internally harmonize true qi with breath; naturally, the transformations restore youthful countenance.\"* Li Daochun said: *\"Opening and closing respond to heaven and earth—this is the gate of the Mysterious Female. From no exit or entry, one alone reigns over the three realms.\"* And again: *\"Carefully observe the books of the sages of the Three Teachings—the character ‘breath’ is simplest. If one works on the practice of breath, becoming a Buddha or an immortal requires no effort.\"* Zheng Heyang said: *\"Where there is a heart-mind, there is breath; heart-mind and breath depend on each other and cannot be separated.\"*",

Your letter asks, *\"Why descend in old age?\"*—this is a misunderstanding. The study of the Dao aims to resolve the three sufferings of old age, sickness, and death. At eighty, one is already aged: vitality wanes, steps falter, and eating becomes difficult. Hearing and sight lose their acuity; hair turns white, the face wrinkles, and death draws near.",

      "translated_text": "Your letter suggests setting aside the Lesser Vehicle’s *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections* to discuss the Great Vehicle’s *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*. Very well—let us speak of these two.\n\nHave you not seen that among the *Śūraṅgama*’s twenty-five sages who attained perfect penetration, two achieved the exhaustion of outflows and realized arhatship precisely through regulating the breath? The first was Śroṇa Koṭīkarṇa, who declared: *“When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, as I have realized it, reversing the breath to merge with emptiness—this is foremost.”* The second was Sundarananda, who said: *“When the Buddha asked about perfect penetration, I dissolved my thoughts, and through long-continued breath-regulation, illumination arose, outflows were extinguished, and this—this is foremost.”* What is meant by “reversing the breath to merge with emptiness”? It is the cessation of external respiration, the transformation of qi into spirit, and the radiance of spirit-light.\n\nFurthermore, in the *Śūraṅgama*’s ten stages of abiding, the phrase *“body and mind unite and grow daily”* describes the interdependence of heart-mind and breath in forming the sacred embryo. *“Having roamed within the Dao-embryo, one personally attends the lineage of awakening; as the embryo matures, the human marks are complete.”* It also states: *“The ten spiritual marks of the body are simultaneously perfected.”* And again: *“Having taken form and emerged from the embryo, one is personally a Buddha-child—this is called the abiding of the Dharma Prince.”* Here, the Dao-embryo is fully realized, and the true person appears.\n\nPeople know only that the *Śūraṅgama* criticizes the ten kinds of immortals, yet they do not realize these immortals belong to the earthly immortals—mere Lesser Vehicle practitioners of immortality. The lineage transmitted beneath the pillar aligns with the *Śūraṅgama*’s ten stages of abiding. Within this profound mystery, those who receive the true transmission understand it for themselves. Among the Great Vehicle scriptures, none so wondrously accords with the esoteric teaching of *“regulating the breath to form the embryo, nurture the embryo, and emerge from the embryo”* as the *Śūraṅgama*.\n\nThe Tiantai school’s contemplative teachings hold that in a single lifetime, one can only attain the initial stage of perfect abiding. Yet in the esoteric tradition’s cultivation and realization, a single lifetime can indeed attain all ten stages of abiding. Those of superior capacity, having realized the ten stages, leap directly into the two wisdoms of equal and wondrous enlightenment. For once the ten stages of abiding are complete, one has attained the Dharma-body, with boundless lifespan—free to roam and cultivate the Dao. The most difficult part is entering the abiding from the state of an ordinary being. How does one enter the abiding? The abiding is constant abiding; if one dies, one does not understand constant abiding. Constant abiding is longevity—both life and nature are eternally abiding.\n\nSetting aside the *Śūraṅgama* for now, let us turn to the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*’s *Chapter on Leaving the Worldly*, which expounds the ten kinds of freedom. The first is *“freedom of life”*—abiding in lifespan for incalculable eons. Is this not the Buddha’s longevity? Have you not also seen in the *Entering the Dharma Realm* chapter that Sudhana visited the bhikṣu Ocean Banner, who had transcended inhalation and exhalation, without any other thoughts or perceptions, and entered the great quiescent samādhi, remaining in that samādhi for six months and six days before emerging? What is meant by *“transcending inhalation and exhalation, without any other thoughts or perceptions”* is precisely the esoteric tradition’s state of *“dual extinction of breath and thought, dual stabilization of body and mind”*—what Master Huzi called *“the Great Thoroughfare, without trace.”* The Great Thoroughfare is the image of emptiness and quiescence; *“without trace”* means no sign is discernible, like the antelope hanging its horns—no trail can be found. This great samādhi was attained by the bhikṣu Ocean Banner, and it is also attained by the esoteric tradition’s good spiritual friends. If, in samādhi, the heart-mind abides but the breath does not, this is only a semblance of quiescent extinction, not true quiescent extinction. Such a person, if their breath were obstructed during samādhi, would be unable to maintain it. Thus, only samādhi without breath is true samādhi. Samādhi with breath is worthless—still water does not harbor dragons. How could one then perfect the ten spiritual marks of the body simultaneously, emerge from the embryo, and personally become a Buddha-child?\n\nFurthermore, in the *Entering the Dharma Realm* chapter, Sudhana’s fiftieth visit was to the youth Virtue-Born and the maiden Virtue-Girl. Their city was called *Wondrous Intention Flower Gate*, and the Dharma-gate they taught was called *Liberation through Illusory Abiding*—this too conceals the secret meaning of *“heart-mind and breath interdependent, harmonizing in samādhi.”* Observe that all the good spiritual friends Sudhana had previously visited were solitary individuals, but here they appear as a pair—what else could this signify but the representation of one yin and one yang, the symbolic harmony of heart-mind and breath? The youth and maiden lived and traveled together. In terms of cultivation, at the stage of fruition, samādhi and wisdom harmonize as a pair; at the stage of practice, heart-mind and breath harmonize as a pair. The word *“wondrous”* is also symbolic—it is one yin and one yang. *“Wondrous Intention Flower Gate”* is akin to the Laozi’s *“Gate of the Myriad Wonders”* and *“Mysterious Female Gate.”* At the moment when heart-mind and breath harmonize, there arises a subtle mutual awareness. When, in quiescent stabilization, yang is born, the time arrives and spirit knows—like a child recognizing its mother. It is wondrous beyond words—is this not *“wondrous intention”*? Heart-mind and breath follow each other, phoenixes in harmony, a natural union of husband and wife. Yet the man does not loosen his robe, nor the woman untie her sash—they revere each other as divine, cherish each other as their own child. Is this not *“illusory abiding”*? Thus it is called *“liberation through illusory abiding.”* Only when one reaches the great samādhi, the true samādhi—without going or coming, without exiting or entering, forgetting both inner and outer, body and mind both quiescent, emptiness without reliance—is this called *“non-abiding.”* From illusory abiding, one attains non-abiding—here, the work of esoteric cultivation is complete.\n\nThe sūtra further states: *“At that time, the youth and maiden, having expounded their own liberation, used the power of inconceivable roots of goodness to make Sudhana’s body soft and radiant.”* The commentary explains: *“Softness”* refers to the state where, through the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, the entire body becomes supple and pliant. Bai Ziqing said: *“After you practice for two or three days, heaven and earth, sun and moon will become soft as silk.”* This is the true effect.",

      "translated_text": "The radiance refers to the effervescence of primordial yang’s luminous *qi* upon the skin, manifesting externally. *The Yellow Court Scripture* states: *“The body generates radiant splendor, its qi fragrant as orchids.”* Master Zhongli Quan said: *“Jade-like nectar flows and glistens, giving rise to luminosity.”* Both express the same meaning. This is the sign of the fiftieth visitation, deeply resonant with the esoteric Daoist tradition. Yet all previous commentators on the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* have spoken only of principle, interpreting the youth and maiden as symbols of *samādhi* and *prajñā*. But for those still in the causal stage—ordinary beings without *samādhi* or *prajñā*—how should they begin their practice? The wondrous gateway of the Flower Adornment City exists within every person. Once the masters point out the mysterious pass, one naturally understands. Such profound and subtle manifestations are not easily discussed with outsiders. For this reason, over the past twenty years, I have never revealed this, fearing it might invite slander. Now, for my brother’s sake, I speak of it—perhaps you may glimpse another heaven and earth, the sun and moon within the gourd, the liberation of illusory abiding, and the truly inconceivable spiritual efficacy.\n\n---\n\nYour letter states: *“The immortals value longevity, while Buddhists value non-arising.”* Know that “non-arising” means not clinging to the appearance of arising, not that one becomes like withered wood or cold ashes, utterly devoid of vitality. If one were truly like withered wood or cold ashes, one would fall into the nihilistic heterodoxy, far from the Buddha’s true intent of neither arising nor ceasing. Laozi said: *“That by which heaven and earth endure so long is their non-self-arising; thus they attain long life.”* “Non-self-arising” means not clinging to arising—true arising without arising. *The Song of Enlightenment by Yongjia* says: *“Who is without thought? Who is without arising? Truly, without arising, there is nothing that does not arise.”* This means that if one realizes the principle of non-arising, one is also without death—thus, without arising yet nothing unarisen. In this light, Laozi’s “long life” does not fall into eternalism, nor does the Buddha’s “non-arising” fall into annihilationism. Without arising yet arising—this is the Buddha; arising yet without arising—this is the immortal. How can one rigidly divide them and rank their superiority? Understanding this, one knows there is no immortal who is not a Buddha, no Buddha who is not an immortal. True non-arising is true long life; true long life is wondrous accord with true non-arising. At this point, the barriers between the Daoist and Buddhist traditions may be entirely dismantled.\n\nNowadays, followers of the Buddha, upon hearing of longevity, dismiss it as heterodoxy, contrary to the Buddha’s original intent. They do not realize that the Buddha, for those attached to the vital essence and whose emotional views remain unbroken, teaches non-arising. But if one’s emotional views are already shattered, it is precisely then that one should be taught longevity. The *Lotus Sūtra* reveals the provisional to manifest the real; the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* exhausts all emotional measures—both reveal the secret of the freely commanded life. In the final teaching of *Nirvāṇa*, entering great *nirvāṇa* means neither aging nor dying, perfectly in harmony with the Yellow and Lao of the East. How can one rigidly adhere to one side, assigning non-arising to Buddhism and longevity to Daoism, exalting non-arising while disparaging longevity? Know that non-arising and longevity are merely different approaches to cultivation and subjugation.\n\n---\n\nWhile the *Śūraṅgama* and *Avataṃsaka* sūtras already interweave the paths of immortals and Buddhas, the most wondrous of all is the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*. Mahākāśyapa asked the Buddha: *“How does one attain long life, an indestructible vajra-body, and through what causes and conditions does one gain great, unshakable power?”*—this is openly inquiring about longevity. The *Four Marks Chapter* states: *“It is like a potter who, having made a vessel, eventually breaks it. Liberation is not like this. True liberation is neither arising nor ceasing; therefore, liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is also thus: neither arising nor ceasing, neither aging nor dying, neither breaking nor decaying, not a conditioned dharma. For this reason, it is called the Tathāgata. Entering great *nirvāṇa*, neither aging nor dying—what does this mean? Aging is called change: hair turning white, skin wrinkling, body decaying, life ending. Such things do not exist in liberation; because they are absent, it is called liberation. The Tathāgata also has no conditioned dharmas like white hair or wrinkled skin; therefore, the Tathāgata is without aging. Without aging, there is no death. Furthermore, liberation is called freedom from illness. What is illness? The four hundred and four diseases, along with other external harms that injure the body—these do not exist in liberation; thus, it is called liberation. Without illness, this is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is without illness; therefore, the Dharma-body is also without illness. Such freedom from illness is the Tathāgata. Death is called the decay of the body and the end of life; where there is no death, this is ambrosia. Ambrosia is true liberation. True liberation is the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata possesses such merits—how can one say the Tathāgata is impermanent? If one claims impermanence, this is impossible. How can the vajra-body be impermanent? Therefore, the Tathāgata is not said to have a life’s end.”*\n\nIn this passage, the Tathāgata extensively demonstrates that those who attain true liberation are neither arising nor ceasing, neither breaking nor decaying, neither aging nor dying, and are free from the unsightly marks of white hair and wrinkled skin. Free from illness, this is no different from the immortals’ long life—one might say the immortal and the Buddha are of one breath, like water and milk perfectly blended. Yet how is it that today’s Buddhists, puffed up with self-importance, look down upon the immortal tradition as heterodoxy, dismissing it as one of the seven destinies? They themselves cannot escape illness, nor can they avoid the changes of white hair and wrinkled skin—no different from ordinary people. What, then, is the meaning of great *nirvāṇa*? What is true liberation? The wonder of ambrosia need not even be mentioned.",
      "overlap_context": "e sūtra further states: *“At that time, the youth and maiden, having expounded their own liberation, used the power of inconceivable roots of goodness to make Sudhana’s body soft and radiant.”* The commentary explains: *“Softness”* refers to the state where, through the interdependence of heart-mind and breath, the entire body becomes supple and pliant. Bai Ziqing said: *“After you practice for two or three days, heaven and earth, sun and moon will become soft as silk.”* This is the true effect.",

      "translated_text": "One must know that after the World-Honored One’s passing, those who grasped the profound purport of *mahāparinirvāṇa*—of neither aging nor dying—were found in the Mystery Tradition. Thus Wang Wenzhi, after broadly studying the Buddha’s teachings, at over eighty years of age suddenly turned to the Dao and followed immortals in their wanderings.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix III: An Entry from the Diary of Elder Li Tingguang**\n\nMaster Songyao said: “Mr. Wang Dongting propagated the Dao in Shanghai for decades yet could not attain the Way himself, his years having already declined into old age. When Master Hanxu arrived, he taught him the method of *tou-tai duo-she* (rebirth through seizing a womb). At the time of Mr. Dongting’s passing, he instructed him (referring to Xu Songyao) to seek him out at a certain time and place (referring to Wang Dongting). However, as war was imminent, he (Xu Songyao) was unable to go. I believe that as long as one does not forget their ‘original true nature,’ *tou-tai duo-she* remains possible.”\n\n*(This diary entry was provided by Mr. Lin Feng of Shanghai. Mr. Li Tingguang once studied under Xu Songyao, also known as Haiyinzi. In the mid-20th century, Li Tingguang and six others—Jiang Weiqiao, Hu Meicheng, Lu Zidong, Chu Xiangjiang, Gu Boshu, and Lu Huaidao—formed the ‘Seven Gentlemen’s Tea Gathering for Nurturing Life,’ exploring Daoist scholarship. It is said that Li Hanxu, the founding patriarch of the Western Lineage, personally came to Shanghai to transmit the *tou-tai duo-she* method to Ti Zhen Shanren Wang Dongting. According to *A Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu* by Li Daoshan of the Qing, Li Hanxu ascended in the year *bingchen* of the Xianfeng era (1856). Yet he manifested again in the world no later than the mid-20th century to transmit the teaching to Wang Dongting, more than sixty or seventy years after his passing. Mr. Lin Feng commented on this passage: ‘Upon first reading this, I was truly startled.’ How could I not feel the same! This also demonstrates the extraordinary efficacy of the ancient transmission of inner alchemy, and the truth of self-mastery and rebirth of life is not false. Daoist scholar Chen Yingning (1880–1969) once remarked: ‘Whether *tou-tai* is truly reliable—rather than being troubled by the inability to verify it with facts, one can only believe it to be extraordinary.’ This case is no different. Whether it is true or not, I do not know. It is merely appended here as documentary material, left for scientific researchers to investigate and verify! Furthermore, the method of *tou-tai duo-she* comprises four types: *tou-tai* (rebirth), *duo-she* (seizing a body), *jie-shi* (borrowing a corpse), and *zhuan-shi* (transmigration)—collectively known as the ‘Four Fruits.’”)*\n\n*—Gan Keqi’s note*\n\n---\n\n**Appendix IV: Excerpt from Mr. Hu Meicheng’s *Postscript to the Exegesis of Southern Lineage Alchemical Secrets***\n\n“In the early 20th century, I made three journeys to Suzhou and personally visited Xu Songyao, the renowned Daoist scholar of Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, known as Master Xuanjing. A graduate of Tsinghua University, Master Xu devoted his life to Daoist studies. In his later years, his disciples numbered in the thousands, and his *Collected Writings on Heavenly Joy* circulated widely. However, he avoided discussing the teachings of the Yin-Yang Lineage.”\n\n“The inner alchemical practice of Daoism, whether in solitary or dual cultivation, hinges upon the critical stage of *huo-zi yang-sheng* (the living child’s arousal) and the gathering of the medicine. Yet many Daoist texts do not speak of this openly—it remains an untransmitted secret. The *huo-zi* moment has three types: the true *zi* hour, the proper *zi* hour, and the false *zi* hour. When the living child’s yang arises, one ignites the fire and gathers the medicine. The medicine itself varies in maturity, distinguished as one yang, two yangs, or three yangs. The medicine is called the ‘true seed,’ hence Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* verse: ‘If the cauldron lacks the true seed, do not waste the furnace’s fire on an empty pot.’ Without receiving the true transmission, many find it difficult to recognize the authentic phenomenon of *huo-zi yang-sheng* when gathering the medicine. For instance, Daoist scholar Xu Songyao’s *Collected Writings on Heavenly Joy* states that when the pure yang *qi* stirs during quiet cultivation, the body may experience numbness, tingling, or twitching, and with each twitch, one circulates a minor celestial orbit, gradually gathering and accumulating. Alas! Numbness, lightness, heaviness, and the like are common ‘eight sensations’ in cultivation. To mistake these eight sensations for the *huo-zi yang-sheng* and the gathering of medicine is entirely mistaken. …If one cultivates quiet practice and mistakes the eight sensations for the arousal of yang, then rousing the yang becomes harmful, allowing the original *qi* to leak away and all prior efforts to be wasted—truly a pity.”\n\n*(This postscript by Mr. Hu Meicheng was provided by Mr. Lin Feng of Shanghai. Mr. Hu made three journeys to Suzhou to personally visit Xu Songyao and inquire about the teachings of the Yin-Yang Lineage, only to be told that Songyao ‘avoided discussing it.’ This avoidance was not due to ignorance of the Yin-Yang Lineage’s teachings but rather an unwillingness to speak of them, likely owing to unspoken difficulties. Consider Haiyin’s reply in *Answers to Ten Questions from Mr. Tang Muxuan*: when asked whether the *Seventeen Daoist Texts* were orthodox or heterodox, he said, ‘Having roamed the Dragon Treasury, one naturally distinguishes at a glance.’ Among the *Seventeen Daoist Texts* are included *The Heart Seal of the Mysterious Subtlety* and *The Alchemical Secrets of the Three Peaks*, both renowned works of the Yin-Yang Lineage. Since he claimed to ‘distinguish at a glance’ after perusing the Dragon Treasury, improper transmission would cause grave harm—hence his reticence.)*",

      "original_text": "又世传西派为阴阳双修派，据予所知，西派可分二大传承系统，一力主清修派，二力主双修派。 然清修派不无深谙阴阳之学，而双修派亦当得清修精髓。 因时地外缘具备不同，各取所修所证，又必异途同归。 外缘不备者，深怀潜藏，讷口不言，以免招致不必要的干扰。 《清净经》中云：“人能常清净，天地悉皆归”。 天地之精华既能招摄，何岂人元不得摄乎？ 清·闵一得辑《古书隐楼藏书·泥丸李祖女宗双修宝筏》中云：“孤修非至道，同类自相须，身外有身者，形忘堪事诸”。 又云：“人元遍大千，三元一心领。 不外心寂虚，不外身无梗。 动静合真常，我无元自并”。 斯论启人慧目。 三元者，天元、地元、人元，而“人元遍大千”，非唯于彼家鼎内。 三元作用，全凭一心领摄，究其功诀，不外“心寂虚”、“身无梗”耳，即“身心两忘，大定真空”者，亦“人能常清净，天地悉皆归”之旨也。 若能“形忘”而致“身外有身”之境界，则“堪事诸”，孤非徒孤，双非徒双，“同类自相须”耳。 《参同契》所谓“磁石吸铁，隔碍潜通”。 是故，清修之中不无有双修之旨，双修之中亦有清净之功。 真修之士，大可持此清净功诀融于双修，彼我共修，“同游于无极之野”，必双双受益，不无夫妻俱仙之举！ 虽双修派中另有“铸剑”、“调鼎”之功，诀法固妙，恐不如斯安稳而无流弊，人人可以实证，亦无须另拟种种戒律约束。 所谓“其义至密而迹至显者”，非此义乎？ 胡美成先生又批评以“酥麻跳动”为阳生药产的错误。 “酥麻跳动”之秘义，详参《天乐集》可也。 聪明学者，必悉所示为何，予不另辨矣。 海印同门魏尧在《大道真传》中云：“古来着书立说，皆对时弊而言”。 海印、美成之论断，亦均纠正时弊之言。 以《伍柳仙宗》而言，强调外肾举动为阳生之候。 不明自然妙用者，执象着形，尚未及“致虚”之境，先妄想阳生，甚至流于色相，又何言“人能常清净”者？ 因此，海印着书立说以纠时弊，仅标“酥软麻木”为阳生，概未使初学着相也。 若“致虚极，守静笃”之中“酥软麻木”，直至“酥软快乐”，亦发生此象，则阳生药产之为候自然生成，方为药源水清。 美成先生所批评者，实批误将“八触”错认阳生及不识阳生之弊。 八触现象，实为入静初阶之表象，仅是气血初通，心识初静之效验，尚未望及“阳生药产”之项背。 以美成前辈之博知，自深知海印之用心。 是以，胡美成先生之批评固是，而海印子所示亦有奥旨。",
      "translated_text": "Moreover, it is commonly held that the Western Lineage is a dual-cultivation school of Yin and Yang. According to my understanding, the Western Lineage divides into two major transmission systems: one advocates solitary cultivation, the other dual cultivation. Yet the solitary-cultivation school is not without profound mastery of Yin-Yang studies, while the dual-cultivation school must also grasp the essence of solitary practice. Given the differences in time, place, and external conditions, each follows its own path to realization, though all ultimately converge. Those lacking the necessary external conditions keep their insights deeply concealed, remaining reticent to avoid unnecessary interference. As the *Classic of Purity* states: “If one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth all return.” If the essence of Heaven and Earth can be drawn in, how could the human element not be gathered as well?\n\nIn *The Precious Raft of Dual Cultivation for the Female Ancestor of the Mud-Pill Lineage*, compiled by Min Yide of the Qing in *Hidden Books of the Ancient Book Concealment Tower*, it is written: “Solitary cultivation is not the supreme Dao; of like kind, each naturally requires the other. Those who attain a body beyond the body can, through forgetfulness of form, accomplish all things.” It further states: “The human element pervades the great thousand worlds; the Three Elements are mastered by one heart. It is nothing beyond a heart serene and empty, nothing beyond a body free of obstruction. In movement and stillness, one harmonizes with the true constant; the self, without origin, naturally merges.” This teaching opens the eye of wisdom.\n\nThe Three Elements—Heaven, Earth, and Human—are such that “the human element pervades the great thousand worlds,” not confined to the crucible of the other household. The function of the Three Elements is entirely governed by the mastery of one heart. In essence, the method lies in “a heart serene and empty” and “a body free of obstruction,” which is to say, “forgetting both body and heart, entering the great samadhi of true emptiness”—this is none other than the principle that “if one can abide in constant purity, Heaven and Earth all return.” If one can “forget form” and attain the state of “a body beyond the body,” then “all things can be accomplished.” Solitary is not merely solitary, dual not merely dual; “of like kind, each naturally requires the other.” As the *Cantong Qi* says: “Like a lodestone drawing iron, though separated by barriers, they communicate in secret.”\n\nThus, within solitary cultivation there is no absence of the principle of dual cultivation, and within dual cultivation there is also the work of purity. True cultivators may well integrate this pure method into dual practice, cultivating together with another, “roaming together in the boundless wilds,” and both will surely benefit, achieving the feat of husband and wife ascending as immortals! Though the dual-cultivation school possesses additional techniques such as “forging the sword” and “regulating the crucible,” with their own subtle methods, these are not as stable and free of pitfalls as the aforementioned approach, which anyone can verify without the need for additional precepts or constraints. Is this not what is meant by “its meaning most profound yet its traces most evident”?\n\nMr. Hu Meicheng further criticized the error of mistaking “tingling, numbness, and throbbing” for the arising of Yang and the production of medicine. The secret meaning of “tingling, numbness, and throbbing” may be found in detail in the *Collection of Celestial Joy*. Discerning scholars will surely understand what is indicated; I need not elaborate further.\n\nWei Yao, a fellow disciple of Haiyin, states in *The True Transmission of the Great Dao*: “Since ancient times, those who write books and establish teachings have all addressed the ills of their time.” The critiques of Haiyin and Meicheng are likewise corrective words aimed at contemporary errors. Take, for example, *The Immortal Lineage of Wu-Liu*, which emphasizes the stirring of the external kidneys as a sign of Yang arising. Those who do not comprehend the wondrous workings of nature cling to appearances and forms, failing to reach the state of “attaining emptiness” before vainly seeking the arising of Yang, even falling into attachment to sensual forms—how then can they speak of “abiding in constant purity”?\n\nThus, Haiyin wrote his books to correct the ills of his time, merely designating “softness, numbness, and tingling” as signs of Yang arising, so as not to lead beginners into attachment to form. If, within “attaining utmost emptiness and maintaining profound stillness,” one experiences “softness, numbness, and tingling,” progressing to “softness and bliss,” then the arising of Yang and the production of medicine occur naturally, and the source of medicine is as clear as pure water.

      "translated_text": "**Appendix VI: The Origins of Printing *The Celestial Music Collection***\n\nWorks on the esoteric arts abound like cattle filling a barn—many have I perused. Yet most conceal the mother in the child, veil the image in metaphor, and though readable, remain hard to grasp. Inevitably, one gropes like a blind man touching an elephant, misguessing and misconstruing, left only with a sense of gazing at the ocean and sighing in awe.\n\nLast autumn, in the year *guichou*, I sought the Way from the Elder of Hidden Valley. He graciously revealed the wondrous discourse on esoteric practice, imparting the essential subtleties of harmonizing heart and breath, and lent me *The Celestial Music Collection*. A cursory reading of but a few chapters sufficed to open my eyes and illumine my mind. Only then did I realize that the elixir formulas transmitted by the sages of old indeed had worthy successors.\n\n*The Celestial Music Collection* was composed by Master Xuanjing (Haiyin). Its contents are vast—reportedly spanning over one hundred scrolls in eight volumes. The copy I obtained comprises but a tenth of the whole. Yet even this partial glimpse reveals the culmination of the elixir formulas of all past sages. It dissects what earlier alchemical texts left unexamined, stripping away the skin to reveal the flesh, with every word guiding one toward sagehood. The arcane purports of the *Can Tong Qi*, *Wu Zhen Pian*, *Yin Fu Jing*, and *Dao De Jing* are laid bare without reservation. Every elixir formula and experiential insight is expounded in exhaustive detail—truly the great compendium of Daoist learning, the compass of elixir classics, and the key to the esoteric arts.\n\nMy fellow cultivator, Xueyangzi—though my senior in the lineage—is also my guide across the ford. The harmony of heart and breath, had he not first illuminated the path, how could I have grasped it so profoundly or embraced it so steadfastly? Bound by the fellowship of immortals, we resonate in voice and seek in kindred *qi*. All that we attain, we refine through mutual exchange, mutually enlightening one another as we advance together.\n\nI lament that fine books are hard to obtain yet easily lost, while lesser scholars cling to the false and stray from the real. *The Celestial Music Collection* resounds like celestial music in the void, suffusing the spirit and nurturing nature. Yet how many lovers of the Way will ever have the chance to read it?\n\nMindful of the deep bonds with my immortal brethren—Yunzhongzi, Qiqiaoxing, and others—and unwilling to hoard such treasures alone, I resolved to commission the printing of several copies to share with kindred spirits, that we might ascend the cloud-path together. Yet, burdened by worldly affairs and myriad obstructions, I had already pledged to oversee the *Immortal Dao Monthly*—now this vow to print *The Celestial Music* weighs upon me as well. Torn between the two, I can but sigh in helplessness.\n\nI consulted Xueyang, who, through the intercession of Tiyang, readily agreed without hesitation. Undaunted by the labor, he undertook to begin anew, and we settled on printing twenty copies. Such a noble-minded seeker of the Way, so generous in aiding the Dao, fills me with profound admiration and boundless gratitude.\n\nThus, I have prefaced this edition with a table of contents for ease of reference and briefly recounted its origins.\n\n**Tianlezi’s Inscribed Poems:**\n\n**I**",
