His family lived near the Wang Qiao Abbey, an ancient site of construction, where halls, terraces, and pavilions had once been wondrous in their craftsmanship. Over the years, however, brambles had overgrown the grounds, and the structures had gradually fallen into ruin. Gao often felt distressed by this but lacked the means to restore them. He maintained only the offerings to the images and statues, and when his farming yielded a modest surplus, he would immediately discuss repairs.\n\nOne of his family’s cowherds tended cattle near the abbey and often encountered a villager—a man with ruddy complexion and short hair, stronger than most, who enjoyed playing with him. When they wrestled, the cowherd usually lost. The man would wait for the boy’s arrival and then frolic with him. Once, when Gao scolded the cowherd for returning late, the boy explained the reason. Gao said, “If he were a ghost or spirit, his body would be light and ethereal.” The boy replied, “His body is ethereal, yet heavy, and he speaks little, moving slowly.” Gao said, “Go again tomorrow, and I will follow to observe. If he offers his strength, I will help you capture him.”\n\nThe next day, the cowherd returned, and the man appeared again. When he exerted his strength, Gao joined the boy in subduing him—only to find he was a golden statue. It was light when carried away but grew heavy upon reaching home, weighing several thousand *jin*. On its back was inscribed: *“For the repair of the abbey, in gratitude to Wang Gao.”* Gao sold the gold to restore the abbey, and the work was completed in a few years. His descendants remain wealthy to this day.\n\n---\n\n**Ji Zonglao**\n\nJi Zonglao was a Daoist from Yuzhang. He wandered through famous mountains, seeking masters and pursuing learning, yet had found nothing of substance. In the second year of the *Dazhong* era (848 C.E.), the year of *wuchen*, while staying at a village abbey in Shuzhou, he encountered a Daoist dressed in tattered robes, braving a fierce wind and snow. The man suddenly appeared, seeking shelter in the abbey. Zonglao shared a room with him for the night. When darkness fell, there were no lamps, and the snowstorm raged on. Suddenly, a light appeared in the room. Peering through a crack, Zonglao saw no flame, yet the space was illuminated. A small gourd emitted a gentle glow, suffusing the curtains, bedding, utensils, and clothing—everything was visible. Realizing the man was extraordinary, Zonglao knocked on his door and sought an audience, but the Daoist did not respond, and the light soon faded. Zonglao sat outside his door all night, hoping to catch a glimpse of him at dawn. When morning came, he pushed open the door, but the Daoist had vanished. Filled with remorse, Zonglao traveled the world in search of him.\n\n---\n\n**He Daozhang**\n\nHe Daozhang was a Daoist from Tianmu Mountain in Kuizhou. Diligent in his practice and devotions, he was revered far and wide. The offerings and alms he received from incense, lamps, and ritual feasts were all used to restore the abbey’s halls and commission images and statues.\n\nThough the altars lay in ruins and the halls in decay—wherever there remained traces of the ancient mysteries of the Daoist gate—he would spare no effort to restore them. Such deeds were many. When the Tianmu Abbey was reduced to ashes by wildfire, leaving scarcely a roof standing, he took up basket and spade himself and labored for five or six years until its towers and halls stood renewed.\n\nEast of Tianmu, sheer cliffs rose, crowned by a withered tree. Beneath it, lights often flickered. Daozhang resolved to plant pines and cypresses there, and as he felled the deadwood, the cliffside crumbled away. Within the rockface yawned a hollow, and inside lay over seventy scrolls of the *Ancient Scriptures of Supreme Clarity*—their cinnabar and ink calligraphy as fresh as if newly inscribed. Yet with construction still underway, he had no time to examine them. A Daoist who borrowed the texts attempted to steal them away in secret, but suddenly darkness fell in a storm, and the scriptures vanished. Once lost, they were never found again.\n\n**Xie Zhen**\n\nXie Zhen was a craftsman from Linye, skilled in plasterwork and meticulous in execution. Once, while repairing the mud-and-lime cranes of the Crane-Cry Abbey’s *Palace of Supreme Clarity*—a temple built in Sichuan during the Heavenly Master’s time—he applied himself with such precision and care that every stroke was flawless. Suddenly, a Daoist entered with two attendants, his bearing extraordinary, his stature towering to nine feet. Addressing Zhen, he said, “It is rare to find such devotion in these mountain repairs. I am humbled by your diligence.” With his finger, he traced a talisman upon the ground, instructing Zhen to memorize it carefully. “From now on,” he said, “if the sick seek healing—even from a thousand *li* away—this talisman will prove effective. Do not charge exorbitantly; let it suffice to sustain your household.” Zhen committed the talisman to memory, and when he put it into practice, its efficacy was profound. He amassed great wealth in gold and silk, and his family prospered.\n\n**Li Ji**\n\nLi Ji was a native of Guizhou.\n\nLi Ji would gather firewood and rest beneath a great tree, where he noticed a scroll lodged among its branches. Taking it down, he found that though some characters were recognizable, they were mostly the names of ghosts and spirits. As he read these names aloud, the ghosts and spirits answered his call. His parents, astonished by this, secretly copied the unfamiliar characters and sought others to decipher them. Thereafter, Li Ji could read and summon the names of ghosts and spirits himself, and each time they responded without fail. He thus gained the power to command them—concealing his form, treading upon water, or reversing its flow with a shout, performing myriad transformations with effortless mastery. Some suspected sorcery and sought to seize him for the authorities, but he declared, “I merely play with the arts; I bring no harm to others. Why treat this as strange?” He later withdrew to Yangshuo Mountain to cultivate the Dao, and to this day, he remains there.\n\n**Ye Qianshao**\n\nYe Qianshao was a native of Xinzhou. In his youth, while gathering firewood, he took shelter from the rain beneath a great tree. Suddenly, he saw the Thunder God trapped between its branches, struggling in vain to break free. The branches had snapped shut after a thunderclap, pinning him fast. Ye Qianshao pried them apart with a stone wedge, allowing the Thunder God to escape. Deeply grateful, the Thunder God said, “Return here tomorrow at this same hour.” Ye Qianshao did as instructed, and the next day, the Thunder God reappeared beneath the tree. Handing him a scroll of ink talismans, he said, “Use these to summon thunder and rain, cure ailments, and swiftly aid those in need. I have four brothers—when you call for thunder, summon *Lei Da* and *Lei Er*, and we will answer. But remember: we five are of fierce and impatient temper. Do not call us unless the matter is urgent.”\n\nFrom then on, whenever Ye Qianshao deployed the talismans to summon rain, their efficacy was extraordinary. Once, while drunk in the marketplace of Jizhou, he was seized by the prefect, who berated him and threatened humiliation. From beneath the eaves, Ye Qianshao cried out, “Lei Wu!” Though the day was scorching and rainless, a deafening thunderclap resounded at once, sending the crowd into disarray. The prefect descended the steps to receive him with reverence, begging him to bring rain. That very night, a torrential downpour fell, and the drought was broken. His fame spread far and wide.\n\nLater, while traveling in Huazhou, he encountered a prolonged deluge that had caused the Yellow River to overflow, forcing officials to labor day and night to contain the flood. Ye Qianshao took an iron rod two feet long, inscribed a talisman upon it, and planted it on the riverbank. The surging waters receded, forming a mound-like barrier, and flowed downstream without daring to breach the talisman’s bounds. Those who witnessed the rescue of the drowning still speak of it today.\n\nWhenever the sick sought his talismans, he would write them without regard for brush or ink, and all who received them found relief. He wandered often through the regions of Jiang and Zhe, fond of meat and wine, and cared little for ascetic discipline. His later whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nMou Yubin was a native of Luodai in Chengdu. Born into poverty, he earned his living as a porter in the marketplace. One day, a young Daoist priest stood in the middle of the road and, seeing him, asked: “I have a load of clothing and hat brims that need carrying into Chengdu. Would you do it?” Yubin agreed, and they set off together until they reached the northern street of Dashu Market. The sun had just passed the hour of *chen* when the Daoist said to him: “It is not yet noon, so we cannot stay here. We must go straight to the mountains.” Yubin followed him further, and by dusk, they had arrived at the gate of Mount Qingcheng. Passing through a spirit shrine and into a bamboo grove, they came upon a cluster of ten or so small huts. The Daoist unlocked one himself. Inside, the rooms were clean and tidy, though no one else lived there. He instructed Yubin to fetch fire from the shrine, while he himself gathered wild vegetables from the hedgerows. He cooked them and shared the meal, then said: “I do not wish to keep you here overnight, but if I send you away, I have no money to give. Here is a booklet for you.” He opened several pages to show Yubin the writing inside. It read: “This formula can transform the beard and hair. If you prepare it according to the instructions, you will have clothing and food for life, and you are certain to encounter good fortune.” Yubin then left the mountain and, upon reaching Shipopo Inn, calculated the distance he had traveled—over two hundred *li* from dawn to dusk. He prepared the medicine according to the formula, and it proved highly effective. When the Duke of Yan, the Prime Minister, was in Shu, he summoned Yubin, bestowed upon him a cap and robe, and gave him the name Yubin. The booklet contained only this one formula, with no other text, and no one else ever obtained it. His later years were spent in Manchuan.\n\nYumanchuan was a musician of Chengdu. His neighborhood suffered from a lack of water, and an old man had long carried water to supply several households. On the third day of the third month, Yumanchuan went to Zhenguan Monastery on Mount Xueshe to visit the silkworm market. There, he saw the old water-seller and spoke with him, learning that he lived nearby. The old man led him through the market, and after they had seen everything, he invited Yumanchuan to his home. They entered a path lined with orange and bamboo trees, crossed ditches and channels for about ten *li*, and then saw gates and halls, with figures bustling about—paintings and murals adorned the place like a grand Daoist temple. They were led into a great kitchen, where many people were gathered, but the old man had vanished. When Yumanchuan asked where he was, he was told that the old man had transformed into a kitchen spirit in Ge Suohua. It was said that the next day’s silkworm market would host a grand vegetarian feast, and in the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. The old water-seller never returned again.\n\nMaster Hou the Celestial Master was from Mutou Market in Jiulong. During the silkworm market at Ge Suohua, he accidentally damaged the clothing bundle of a Daoist traveler and was seized with terror. The Daoist, however, showed no anger and instead gave him a talisman, saying, “If you copy this and follow its instructions, you can cure various illnesses and secure clothing and food for life.” Hou did as instructed, and the talisman proved increasingly effective over time. Initially, it was called the Celestial Master’s Talisman, but now people refer to him as Master Hou the Celestial Master.\n\nThe Han Clan Maiden was from Zhen Duo Hua in Luoxian. When Liu Pi occupied Chengdu and the imperial army marched west to suppress him, soldiers were about to reach Zhen Duo Market, and the local gentry and commoners fled into the wilderness. The maiden, fifteen or sixteen years old, came from a well-off family and was unaccustomed to long journeys on foot. She took refuge in Zhen Duo Monastery, where a young attendant led her inside. There, she saw several young Daoist nuns playing chess by the window. Soon, she was brought before an elder nun, who said to her, “Do not be alarmed. Just sit calmly and watch the game.” After a long while, they gave her a meal. Then they said, “Your family must be worried. You may return home.” The attendant led her back, and she found that three days had passed.\n\nThe Han Clan Maiden then extensively renovated the monastery halls, venerating and adorning the sacred images to repay her gratitude.\n\nWang Chai, a presented scholar named Wang Jie, was a man devoted to fishing through the classics and hunting through the histories. With tireless diligence, he plumbed depths untouched by ancients and attained insights ungrasped by former Confucians. He composed the *Jiu Gu Zi* in thirty fascicles, wherein the gains and losses of the Six Classics and the errors of historical records were laid bare—none escaped his lancing of their festering sores to cure the blind. Among his works was the \"Two Bells\" essay, and his exegeses on Buddhist parables surpassed even the lofty discernment of ancient connoisseurs. Fond of wine for his own amusement, he cared little for convention. Beyond the joy of intoxication, he would invariably delve into the treasuries of meaning, probing the mechanisms of rhetoric—much like Liu Lan’s scathing rebukes of the ancients. Yet his habit of inhaling wind and dew, chewing mist and clouds, had over time bred a lingering malady, delicate as jade, which no remedy could cure.\n\nDuring his travels, he encountered a man with a cherrywood staff and a shuttle-shaped bamboo hat, his crane-like visage noble and ancient, unlike his peers. His name was Xi Dao. Smiling, he said, “Does the young man suffer the burden of the Three Regrets? Why else this emaciation?” Wang denied it was so.\n\nXi Dao replied, “Your malady can be cured. Though I have attained the crucible’s power through liberation, what illness could withstand its effect? Offer your allegiance and take me as your master.”\n\nThey purified themselves by the banks of the Zhang River, and after three days, Xi Dao transmitted his secret method: “The wood-fluid harmonizes with the celestial soul; the metal-essence merges with the earthly spirit. Kan and Li circulate in motion—let there be no forced completion. Metal and wood follow their measures; Qin and Jin unite in harmony. Near at hand, the effect comes in sixty days; at most, it requires three years.”\n\nHe chanted:\n*\"When the spirit faintly enters the soul, the male and female conjoin,\nThe yang’s kiss and yin’s moisture make gods and ghosts vanish.\nA thousand songs, ten thousand praises—all fall short;\nFrom ancient times to now, sun and moon receive and refine it.\nTake it as sustenance, and in a full cycle of stars, the malady will fade.\"*\n\nThereafter, Xi Dao concealed himself in obscurity, feigning madness to blend with the times. At eighty, he was seen on the road to Mount Peng; those who recognized him revered him. Soon after, he appeared again in Chengdu, often lodging in Le Wen County.\n\nAt the time, a beast with a knotted tail wrought great harm. Xi Dao, drunk, slept in the wild grass, exposing himself in the forest, fearing nothing—he aspired to be among those who attain the Dao through the cicada’s molting.\n\nWang Congji, the chronicler, was a eunuch-official.\n\nWhen the King of Shu first governed the region of Shu, Li and Ya were under the jurisdiction of Yongping Army, and Congji served as the supervisory judge-official. From then on, after pacifying Chengdu, the military governorship was abolished and it became a prefecture. Congji dwelled in Shu for over a decade, enduring poverty yet fond of goodness, never settling in one place. In the Ye market, an old man eyed him and said: \"Great sighs await you, and you shall be a guest at the place of death.\" He reached into his sleeve and produced a small gourd, offering fourteen grains of cinnabar with the words: \"Take this for ten days, and a beard will grow—do not be alarmed. This will spare you from disaster.\" After three to five days of ingestion, a beard indeed sprouted. Over a month later, when the imperial decree ordered the execution of eunuchs, Congji was among them. Someone urged him to flee, but he replied: \"How can I escape the command of lord and father?\" He bowed his head and submitted to the executioner. The prefect, moved by pity, petitioned the King of Shu on his behalf, pleading for clemency. Upon seeing his appearance, the king found no trace of a eunuch left in him.\n\nCui Xuanliang\nCui Xuanliang was a native of Rongyang.\n\nThe Cui family had long cherished the Dao, diligently maintaining incense offerings and regularly reciting the *Huangting Jing* and the *Daode Jing*. During the Baoli era, Cui Xuanliang was appointed Prefect of Huzhou. He conducted the Yellow Register Retreat at the Purple Ultimate Palace, where three hundred and sixty-five cranes descended upon the altar. Among them, one crane perched atop the Tower of the Void Sovereign—its body radiant white, save for its crimson crown. Purple qi suffused the altar grounds, lingering from dawn until dusk before dissipating. The Prefect of Hangzhou, Bai Juyi, composed a eulogy:\n\n*\"O bird, O bird,\nFrom the northwest you came,\nCrimson-crowned, flame-tipped,\nWhite plumage like snow unfurled.\nBeyond the Liao waters you flew,\nYet never past Mount Wei—\nAh, in Wuxing’s domain,\nWhy did you alight here?\"*\n\nAt the beginning of the Baoli era, during the Three Primordials and Four Retreats, as the rites proceeded in broad daylight, purple clouds descended, accompanying the three hundred and sixty cranes in circling the altar. Above, they illuminated the mysteries of the Dao; below, they graced the realm of immortals. Who dwelled here? The Prefect, Cui Xuanliang, was deeply moved, redoubling his devotion. One day, while reciting the *Huangting Jing* in his quiet chamber, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room. He died without illness, and when his coffin was carried for burial, it was as light as if it held only his robes. Xuanliang’s son, serving in the Jinling administration, cast off his official garb and departed, dwelling on Mount Mao. There, he found contentment in zither and wine, and like his father, shed his form to depart the world.\n\nIt is said that the Prefect of Huzhou, who often recited the *Huangting Jing* and the *Duren Jing*, would hold an incense burner in his quiet chamber as he chanted the scriptures. Suddenly, he passed away, leaving only his incense burner and ritual robes when interred in the ancestral tomb at Rongyang.\n\nThe Daoist Qian\nThe Daoist Qian was a native of Lin’an in Hangzhou. Initially a minor clerk, he served the Prefect Linghu Xun and accompanied him to the capital. At that time, the imperial court dispatched General Han Zhong of the Gold Lancer Guard as an envoy to Yunnan, with the scholar Yuan Xun as his deputy. Qian traveled with Yuan to Yunnan. Yuan was devoted to the practice of Daoist rites. Upon reaching Chengdu, they encountered a Yellow Register Retreat at the Jade Bureau Abbey. Yuan lodged at the abbey to observe the rituals, and Qian was permitted to join him.\n\nAfter the consecration of the altar, two Daoists suddenly appeared, one wielding a sword and the other holding a bowl of water. Clad in purple robes and towering headdresses, they stood seven or eight feet tall, circling the altar along the cloister. When they reached Qian, the Daoist with the water bowl bade him drink. The water was exquisitely sweet, and Qian took several sips before the Daoists departed. From that day forth, Qian abstained from food, his countenance radiant with joy. Yuan, astonished, had a Daoist cap and robe made for him, initiating him into the Way.\n\nDuring the Qianfu era, Qian still frequented the capital, but his whereabouts thereafter became unknown.\n\nLinghu Xun\n\nLinghu Xun was the son of Linghu Xun, Prefect of Yuhang. He held refined reverence for the subtle mysteries of the Dao and pursued no official career. At his private retreat in Kaihua, he built a seclusion chamber where, every three to five days, he would open the room, burn incense, and remain within for an entire day before emerging. At times, immortals descended to him, and wondrous smoke and rare fragrances were often seen and smelled throughout the courtyard.\n\nDuring his meditations, a youth in azure led him to a towering mountain in the heavens, where he paid homage to the Lord Lao. There, he witnessed the celestial register appointing Master Zhang as the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, succeeding the office of Perfected Yin. Earlier, Yin had debated merits with the Three Heavens before the Most High, who declared: \"The barbarian hordes have ravaged the Central Plains, devouring the land of Hua like silkworms, and this failure to restrain them is the fault of Perfected Yin. Yet the twenty-four transformations established to distinguish between humans and spirits, bringing blessings to all living beings, are the achievements of Daoling. These two must each ascend the terrace to reflect and be tested by the Great Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, Perfected Yin was commanded to ascend a jeweled terrace of a single lotus, where he sat in solemn stillness. Soon, the scene grew dim and murky. Then Daoling was also ordered to mount the terrace. After sitting for a long while, extraordinary hues and radiant lights manifested in myriad transformations, and the realms of humans and heavens rejoiced together. From that time, Daoling succeeded Yin as the Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nIn the year *yiwei*, I heard Linghu’s account. In the year *dingyou*, while in Mengyang in western Sichuan, I met Daoist Zhang, who said that the Heavenly Master had descended to transmit the Daoist teachings. Revered by all near and far, he recounted the Heavenly Master’s elevation to the office of Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm. His account matched Linghu’s in every detail, with no discrepancy in the debate of merits or the ascension of the terrace. The profound workings of the Dao remain obscure and unverifiable; I merely record these marvels.\n\nLi Quan, styled Daguanzi, dwelled on Mount Shaoshi. Fond of the Way of immortals, he often traveled to famous mountains, collecting esoteric methods. At Tiger Mouth Crag on Mount Song, he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman*, written on silk and bound with cinnabar lacquered rollers, sealed in a jade casket. The inscription read: \"Seventh day of the seventh month, first year of the Taiwei era of the Great Wei.\" The Shangqing Daoist Kou Qianzhi had concealed it among the famous mountains to transmit to like-minded seekers, but the original had decayed. Quan copied and read it thousands of times yet never grasped its meaning.\n\nHaving entered Qin, he arrived at the foot of Mount Li, where he encountered an elderly woman. Her topknot sat high upon her head, the rest of her hair hanging loosely; clad in tattered robes, she leaned upon a staff, her bearing most singular. By the roadside, she saw a tree scorched by an abandoned fire and remarked to herself: \"Fire is born of wood, yet calamity inevitably consumes its source.\" Quan, startled, asked her: \"This is a passage from the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman*—how do you know these words?\" The woman replied: \"I have received this talisman for three *yuan* and six cycles of sixty years. How did one so young come by it?\" Quan bowed deeply, prostrating himself, and recounted how he had obtained it. The woman said: \"Your bones, young one, align with the Gate of Life; your fate is as balanced as the Sun’s Angle. Your blood and marrow remain unspent, your heart’s reflection unwarped. Wise and devoted to the method, you are both spiritually bold and joyfully discerning—truly my disciple. Yet at forty-five, you shall face a great sigh.\" Thereupon, she produced a cinnabar-written talisman, threading it onto the tip of her staff. She bade Quan kneel and swallow it, saying: \"May Heaven and Earth protect you.\" Then, seated upon a stone, she expounded the meaning of the *Hidden Talisman* to him: \"This talisman contains three hundred words in all: one hundred expound the Dao, one hundred expound the method, and one hundred expound the technique. Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing unity; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the techniques for strengthening armies and securing victory. All arise from the inner workings of the mind and align with the affairs of the outer world.\"\n\nGazing into its subtleties, even the *Yellow Court* and *Eightfold Radiance* cannot compare in profundity; discerning its essentials, the classics, commentaries, philosophers, and histories cannot match its refinement. Relying on its ingenuity, even Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Han Xin, and Bai Qi would find nothing extraordinary in it. Only those of the Dao may be permitted to hear it—thus the perfected employ it to attain the Dao, the noble employ it to master its techniques, and the common employ it only to invite misfortune, for their capacities differ.\n\nWhen transmitting it to those of like aspiration, one must first purify oneself through fasting; those with the root become masters, those without remain disciples. One must not value the rich and noble nor disdain the poor and lowly—those who violate this shall forfeit twenty years of their lifespan.\n\nRecite it seven times on one’s natal day to sharpen the mind and prolong life. Each year on the seventh day of the seventh month, copy a version and conceal it within a famous mountain’s stone cavern to gain fifteen additional years of fate.\n\nAfter some time, the mother said: \"The sun has set; I have millet porridge—let us eat together.\" From her sleeve she produced a gourd and bade Quan fetch water from the valley. Once filled, the gourd suddenly weighed over a hundred *jin*; unable to control it, he let it sink into the spring. Upon returning, his mother had vanished, leaving only several *sheng* of millet porridge. Quan ate it and thereafter abstained from grain.\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, he served as Vice Military Commissioner of Jiangling and Censor-in-Chief. Quan possessed military strategy and composed the *Tai Bai Yin Jing* in ten fascicles, as well as the *Zhong Tai Zhi* in ten fascicles. At the time, he was sidelined by Li Linfu and never attained high office. Eventually, he entered the famous mountains in search of the Dao, and his later whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n**Elder Deng**\nElder Deng dwelled in Changjiang of Suizhou, near the border of Tongquan. His estate spanned several thousand *mu*, with an ancient Daoist abbey standing amidst the fields. Amidst the ravages of war, households scattered, livelihoods collapsed, and fertile lands reverted to wilderness, yet his afflictions never ceased.\n\nOne day, while walking through the abbey, he saw scriptures strewn about. As he gathered and rolled them, an old man suddenly appeared and said: \"This is Lord Lao’s *Pillow Scripture*. If you recite it diligently, blessings will come, and calamities will not touch you.\" Deng listened respectfully and took the small scroll the old man indicated. When he finished tidying up, the old man had vanished.\n\nThereafter, he recited the *Pillow Scripture* through the nights, totaling several thousand repetitions. Within a year or two, his household prospered, and even amidst the chaos of war, he knew no fear. A man named Kang Gong of Chengdu, who often visited his home, obtained the scripture and recited it with devotion. When the city was besieged and many perished, Kang’s family of over ten, though lacking provisions, remained unharmed, escaping disaster. To this day, Kang’s descendants continue to uphold this scripture.\n\n**Yang Chu**\nYang Chu was a native of Chengdu. Wealthy, he resided in the Gold and Silver Market of the Eastern Market, serving his parents with filial piety, earning praise from kin and friends. While visiting Ge Xian Abbey, he encountered the true portrait of Perfected Luo Gongyuan and made daily offerings of incense and lamps.\n\nYears later, when the Prince of Shu occupied Chengdu, heavy taxes were levied, and both public and private coffers were drained. Yang’s family exhausted their resources, paying seven hundred thousand in military tribute, pledging their estate to cover half. One evening, officials pressed for payment, and fearing his mother’s distress, he dared not inform her.\n\nSuddenly, a villager spoke to him: \"The official debt is urgent—how will you manage?\" Yang explained his plight, and the man instructed him to procure raw iron and prepare charcoal. That night, the man lodged at Yang’s home, filling the furnace with iron and charcoal to forge it, drinking wine together. By evening, he left Yang with an elixir, saying: \"Use half this gold for the official debt and half to restore your estate. I am Perfected Luo of Qingcheng; meet me on Qingcheng Mountain. Consume this elixir, and we shall see each other there.\" With that, he departed. The iron had transformed into gold.\n\nAfter repaying the military tribute, Yang daily provided his mother with sweet delicacies. One day, he swallowed the elixir and went directly to Qingcheng Mountain. Upon his return, he gave the remaining elixir to his mother; though she was already advanced in years, her hair turned black, and within half a year, her ailments were cured.\n\nLiu Yanguang was a native of Lubi Village in Jinling. He once served as an official in the Zhexi headquarters under Military Commissioner Tang Ruoshan. Ruoshan was devoted to the Dao, and both he and his younger brother Ruoshui encountered immortals, who imparted to them the essentials of the Way. During the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang favored Ruoshan with exceptional regard, granting him the staff of authority to govern Zhexi. After a year, Ruoshan abandoned his post and set sail upon the sea, leaving a memorial in his boat. The surveillance commissioner reported the matter to the throne, and an edict ordered Ruoshui to search for him among the immortal mountains of Jiangling, though his whereabouts remained unknown.\n\nA decade later, Yanguang was dispatched on a mission to Yangzhou. At the fish market, he encountered Ruoshan, who was selling fish beneath an awning. Ruoshan summoned Yanguang to his home. The lanes were narrow and dilapidated, the paths overgrown with weeds, the dew-laden grasses soaking passersby, barely allowing room for a person to walk. Yet upon entering the gate, the ground gradually leveled, paved with bricks and adorned with flowers. The pavilions and terraces were embellished with luxuries rarely seen in the mortal world. Ruoshan bade him sit and served him food.\n\nLearning that Yanguang still owed official debts and that his household was destitute, Ruoshan pitied him, his concern evident in his expression. Later, he instructed Yanguang to prepare raw iron and charcoal at his lodging. That evening, Tang arrived at the inn, placed the iron and charcoal in a blazing fire, and departed, saying: \"Your descendants in future generations are destined to encounter the Dao in the immortal mountains; you should not remain in minor official posts but instead preserve your integrity in reclusion among the hills and gardens. Use one-third of this gold to settle your official debts, and the remaining two-thirds to enrich your estate. Do not indulge in rare delicacies, lest you diminish your allotted lifespan; do not wear fine silks, lest you reduce your good fortune. The Dao values secret merit and benefiting others—exert yourself to aid those in urgent need.\"\n\nThe *Uppermost Scripture of the Five Thousand Characters for Salvation*, the sublime sutra, he diligently practiced. Yan'guang used the gold as instructed to repay his official debts and established his household at Lübi. He lived to eighty or ninety years of age, and in later years, his grandson Song entered the Dao at Mount Tiantai.\n\n**Master Feng Zun**\nMaster Feng Zun’s origins were unknown. Initially a novice, he traveled to Maoyou Mountain in Songyang County, Chuzhou, where he resided for months at the former abode of Master Ye. He petitioned his master to be ordained as a Daoist and was permitted to dwell on Maoyou Mountain. His master departed, leaving him alone on the mountain. Feng sold his robes to purchase materials, constructing a thatched hut of reeds and timber. Once completed, wildfire consumed it. He again entreated the villagers for bamboo and wood, rebuilding as before—only for it to burn once more. For months, he sheltered beneath a cliff, enduring repeated trials by strange beings that sought to deter his resolve. Then Master Ye descended and bestowed upon him a white elixir, the size of a pea, saying: \"This year, a great pestilence will strike. Use this elixir to save lives—one pill will cure an entire household’s affliction.\" With a single *dou* of the elixir, he healed countless sufferers. The grateful people donated wealth, tiles, and timber, constructing halls, bell towers, altars, and cloisters atop the mountain. Within a year, all was complete.\n\nWhen Prefect Chen Ru of Quzhou fell ill, he summoned Feng to treat him, but Feng refused despite the lavish offerings. Chen soon passed away. His younger brother, the regional governor, donated gold and silk to support Feng’s meritorious works. During the Zhongyuan Festival, Feng invited over twenty Daoist priests to perform a fifteen-night *Huanglu* ritual. The moon shone as bright as day, the sky cloudless. Suddenly, a freezing gale arose, and thunder cracked. Mid-ritual, Feng vanished. A fragrant mist enveloped the mountain, astonishing all. Moments later, Feng reappeared, saying: \"Just now, Master Ye and the Three Heavens’ Master Zhang descended, gifting me a divine sword. They commanded me to cultivate here and await further decree, after which I shall emerge to wield this sword in service of the realm.\" Before the altar lay a sword over three *chi* long, alongside a scroll four to five *chi* in length and three *chi* wide—similar to mortal paper yet vastly larger, beyond human craftsmanship.\n\nGovernor Lu, hearing of the divine sword, established a *Huanglu* altar in the grand hall and invited Feng and the Daoist assembly to escort the sword into the prefecture in a decorated palanquin. Two to three hundred paces from the city gates, the sword leapt like lightning into the altar’s heart, where it remained for some time. Lu wished to present it to the military commissioner, but Feng said: \"Master Ye declared that when the time comes to aid the nation, the Supreme Decree will arrive. Now is not that time—it must not be prematurely revealed.\" Lu assented, and the sword remains on Maoyou Mountain to this day. Master Ye once told others: \"A hundred and sixty years hence, one surpassing my arts will dwell here.\" Now, Feng has fulfilled his prophecy.\n\n**Song Wencai**\nSong Wencai was a native of Pengshan County in Meizhou. Once, while traveling with several companions to the summit of Mount Emei, he lost his headscarf and sandals while searching for them. Separated from his group, he encountered an old man who led him onward. The path widened into vast plains adorned with rare flowers and precious trees. After several hundred paces, they arrived at a palace of jade steps and cloud-piercing towers—sights unseen in the mortal world. The old man guided him to a terrace of pearl and medicinal herbs, where he beheld the surrounding peaks. A game of *weiqi* was laid upon the ground, Daoists played, azure youths gathered herbs, clear streams cascaded over stones, and sacred cranes soared in the sky. Astonished, Wencai asked the old man: \"Where is this place?\"\n\nThe old man replied: \"Among the famous mountains and minor grotto-heavens, there are thirty-six heavens. This is the grotto-heaven of Mount Emei—the twenty-third heaven where true immortals dwell.\" As they bowed and took their seats, someone repeatedly called out Wencai’s name. The old man said: \"Your companions are searching for you. You cannot stay long. You may return in another year.\" He ordered an attendant youth to lead Wencai outside the gate to meet his companions. When Wencai turned back, the immortal palace had vanished.\n\nHis companions said: \"We lost you half a month ago. We have searched for you every day, and only today have we found you again.\" Wencai recounted all the marvels he had encountered.\n\nLiu Jing\nLiu Jing of Pengcheng was traveling through Mount Jinhua in search of truth and the Dao. When he reached the mountainside, he noticed the scenery was extraordinary—the mountains and streams were lush and verdant. He saw towering gates and lofty pavilions soaring above the clouds. Upon entering, he found clear pools on either side, fine trees arranged in orderly rows, their trailing vines delicate, and their fruit resembling pears, their fragrance filling the air. Liu Jing looked around but saw no one. He plucked some of the fruit and tucked it into his sleeves, intending to eat it later. Suddenly, several fierce dogs bounded out, barking and snarling, ready to attack. Flustered and at a loss, Liu Jing looked around but found no stones to throw. He reached into his sleeves for the fruit he had picked and hurled it at the dogs. Once the fruit was gone, the dogs departed. When he turned back, the palaces and halls had disappeared, leaving only overgrown woods and thickets.\n\nAt the time, the monk Xiu was a close friend of Liu Jing and often spoke of this event.\n\n*Records of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll One (end)*\n\n*Records of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Two*\nCompiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting\n\nPengl Qiu\n\nPengl Qiu, styled Bojian, was a native of Beihai. During the Tai Shi era of the Jin dynasty, he entered the Jade Maiden Mountain west of Beiqiu to fell timber. Suddenly, he detected a strange fragrance and followed the scent with the wind. The mountain parted of its own accord, revealing towering palaces and sprawling halls, their terraces and pavilions grand and expansive. Qiu entered through the gate and peered inside, where he saw five jade trees. Advancing slightly, he beheld four immortal maidens playing *weiqi* in the hall. Upon seeing Qiu, they all rose in surprise and asked, “Master Peng, how have you come here?” Qiu replied, “I followed the fragrance.” With that, they resumed their game as before. A younger maiden ascended a tower, plucking her zither in jest and singing, *“Why does Yuanhui alone ascend the tower?”* Qiu stood by one of the trees, and feeling hungry, licked the dew that dripped from its leaves.\n\nPresently, a woman arrived riding a crane and said, “Yuhua, why have you allowed this mortal here?” She added, “The Queen Mother—now known as Wang Fangping—is inspecting the chambers of the immortals. You must send him away at once.” Terrified, Qiu fled through the gate, and when he turned back, all had vanished. Upon returning home, he found it was already the Jianping era. The old villagers and his former dwelling had become ruins and graves. Thereafter, he wandered through famous mountains in search of the Dao and never returned.\n\nWang Kejiao\n\nWang Kejiao was a native of Kunshan in Suzhou. Originally a farmer, he had no knowledge of the Dao. At the age of several years, his eyes began emitting a five-colored light, which intensified at night, allowing him to see clearly even in pitch darkness. Some said to his kin, “This is an affliction—when the light fades, he will lose his sight.” His parents, in their ignorance, summoned a common physician to cauterize his eyes, and the light vanished.\n\nIn the eleventh month of the tenth year of the Xiantong era, Kejiao was returning home from the market when he saw a large barge on the river, adorned with gold and brocade, embellished with pearls and kingfisher feathers, and filled with music. Kejiao stood watching as the barge drew near the shore. A youth in azure robes beckoned him aboard, where he saw over ten figures in towering crowns and feathered robes, their garments patterned with clouds, mist, mountains, and rivers, each holding a musical instrument. One of them announced, “Uncle Wang the Third wishes to meet you, though we know not whence he comes.” Another remarked, “His immortal bones have been damaged by fire. He must not drink wine, and if he abstains from food for ten years, he may attain the Dao.” They gave him a chestnut, instructing him to eat it. Kejiao consumed half, keeping the other half in his hand.\n\nThe music played on as they drank wine, and the youth once more led him ashore. Suddenly, as if in a dream, his feet had barely touched the ground when he found himself beneath the waterfall cliffs of Mount Tiantai—an instant that spanned a thousand *li* by land and water. The prefect of Taizhou, Yuan Cong, suspected deception and sent an official inquiry to verify his hometown. From the day Kejiao vanished to the moment he appeared at Tiantai, twenty days had passed. Thereafter, he ate nothing, his complexion glowing with vitality. Prefect Yuan presented him with a feathered robe and settled him in the Purple Ultimate Palace. Wang Feng, the Surveillance Commissioner and Grand Master of Remonstrance of Yuezhou, memorialized: \"At first, his spirit wandered to the heavens, where he heard a single strain of the *Xiaoshao* melody; then, as if waking from a dream, thirty days had elapsed in the mortal world. Though a decade is said to be the term, I fear he may take flight in a single morning.\" The imperial edict declared: \"The traces of divine immortals are recorded in fine silk; his numinous marvels are worthy of note. Upon careful consideration, he is no ordinary man. Moreover, his dwelling is a famed mountain—timeless and unchanged, ancient or modern—where Penglai and Yingzhou are not far distant. Command the local authorities to attend to his well-being and allow him to dwell in seclusion.\" Thus, he was left to wander and rest as he pleased. For several years, he remained in the region south of the Yangtze.\n\nChen Jian was a minor clerk of Jinzhou’s Jinhua County. One dawn, he arrived at the county office before the gates had opened and lingered, waiting. Suddenly, he encountered a Daoist traveler hurrying past. Glancing at Jian, the traveler was unknowingly followed.\n\nAfter walking some three to five *li*, they reached a Daoist abbey, its halls and pavilions resplendent, nestled against a great mountain. The traveler led Jian into a dim chamber, where a desk, brushes, ink, and other writing implements were arranged. He handed Jian a scroll of yellow silk and over ten sheets of paper, saying, \"Since you have an affinity for writing, copy these for me.\" Unfurling the scroll, Jian saw it was all in ancient seal script. Though he had never studied such characters, and indeed had never pursued formal learning, his heart sank at the difficulty. Yet the Daoist had already departed, leaving no room for refusal. Tentatively, he followed the text and found it surprisingly easy—he completed the task in half a day. The Daoist then offered him a cup of broth, saying, \"This is the divine nectar of Jinhua, not to be lightly obtained. Whoever drinks it shall enjoy boundless longevity.\" Its taste was sweet and exquisite. The Daoist commended him, expressed his gratitude, and sent him off, adding, \"When the world grows troubled, return to this Jinhua Grotto-Heaven of Lang.\" Stepping outside, Jian felt as if waking from a dream—three days had already passed.\n\nUpon returning home, he practiced seal script, his brushwork vigorous and extraordinary, and he no longer consumed food or drink. Magistrate Xian Zifang, who was then compiling esoteric records, found the matter most unusual and deemed it a propitious sign from the immortals. He issued a county decree stating: \"As secret records are being transmitted, this auspicious omen has appeared. It clearly marks the threshold of enlightenment and is surely a portent of attaining transcendence.\" Soon after, Jian returned to Mount Jinhua, though he occasionally revisited the prefectural city. Shao Tu...\n\nShao Tu, a native of Yuyao, passed the imperial examination as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate and was appointed as a clerk in the Jiangdong region, later serving as acting magistrate of a county. In his later years, he awakened to the Dao, received talismans and registers, and took up the cap and robe of a Daoist on Mount Tiantai. Master Xie later changed his name to Zhengtu, and his devotion to his teacher’s Way surpassed even his filial piety toward his parents. He resided at the former site of Master Ye on Mount Siming.\n\nHis younger brother, Dewen, was deeply versed in Confucian learning but had not yet grasped the profound principles of the Dao. Tu was on good terms with Jin Shao of Mount Siming, treating him as a brother and serving him as such for over a decade without ever visiting. One day, however, he saddled his horse and ascended the mountain to call on Jin. Midway, he encountered three Daoist wanderers carrying baskets and gathering herbs. One of them addressed Tu, saying: \"There will soon be warfare in the mountains, and the rivers and lakes will fall into chaos. The five grains will soar in price, making it unfit to remain here. Since your heart is set on the Dao, you should hasten to travel and seek refuge elsewhere.\"\n\nTu glanced into their baskets, which were filled with lingzhi mushrooms, fungi, and medicinal sprouts, but dared not ask for any. After speaking, they continued up the mountain. His companions, surprised by his delay, gradually recounted what had occurred.\n\nThe mountain's sheer cliffs, known as Great Orchid Ram's Brow, allowed passage only by a narrow bird-track, a single green path that cut off all other routes. Tu and the three Daoists met and walked together, unseen by anyone else. That evening, they lodged at Jin’s hut. At dawn’s first light, Tu returned to his own dwelling. There, he spoke through the night with his close friend Gao Tan until the dim glow of predawn. Then, clad in a paper Daoist robe and holding a bamboo slip, he knelt upright and transformed. All his books and belongings were meticulously inventoried and sealed before him; when opened, they were found to be distributed among old relatives and friends, with nothing overlooked.\n\nHis younger brother, constrained by Confucian rites, wept in grief until, after a long while, Tu revived. He said, \"I have attained the Dao—this is not death. Why such sorrow?\" Having spoken, he suddenly transformed again. That year, warfare indeed erupted. From then on, ramparts multiplied across the Central Plains, and famine spread far and near, all as the Daoists had foretold.\n\nTu’s transformation—kneeling with a tablet—along with his brother’s seated passing, were not Confucian customs; thus, his brother stretched out Tu’s legs and seated him properly. The chronicler lamented his brother’s confinement by worldly conventions and failure to grasp the Dao.\n\nWu Fan\nWu Fan’s secondary estate lay at the foot of Mount Bian in Huzhou. Beside it stood a mound, three or four *zhang* high and several *bu* in circumference, its summit crowned by a massive, slanting boulder. Wu Fan once led laborers to haul it with long ropes, and the stone suddenly tilted. Beneath it yawned a cavern, deep and luminous. A worker descended with a rope and saw rows of jars lining the cave—over ten in all—filling both walls, their interiors brimming with blood-red water. There were also many small vessels, neither bronze nor gold yet gleaming, their engravings so exquisite they seemed beyond human craft. As the cavern deepened, fear drove him out. He took the smallest vessel to show outside, but upon emerging, it vanished. The cave was then resealed with stone.\n\nLater, someone found a bronze jar in a nearby grove, holding six or seven *dou* of the same crimson liquid. When poured into a stream, the water turned red for days. An old woman also discovered a patterned stone, lustrous and fine. When it accidentally fell into fire, an extraordinary fragrance wafted far and wide. Recognizing its rarity, she kept it as a treasure. Each time it was cast into fire, the same fragrance arose, though it eventually disappeared.\n\nAt the time, a local villager received a prophecy: \"Beneath Mount Bian lies priceless incense and the elixir of immortality.\" This matched the old woman’s fragrant stone and Wu Fan’s ten jars of crimson water, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nWang Sheng\nWang Sheng once traveled through Wucheng in Huzhou, passing beneath Mount Jinzi.\n\nThe stone gate stood wide open, and so he entered through it. Rows of dwellings stood closely aligned, wells and pavilions dotted the landscape like a chessboard, while rare flowers and exotic trees flourished—scarcely resembling the mortal world. The inhabitants wore cloud-like crowns and feathered robes, their bearing lofty and ancient, as if they were immortals. Wang Sheng marveled at the wondrous sights, harboring thoughts of staying there. He composed a poem before departing, but upon returning to seek it again, before Mount Jinzi he saw only towering cliffs of sheer stone—no trace of the immortal realm remained.\n\n**The Guest of Jinting**\nDuring the Xiantong era, a traveler from Jinting set out from the Jinting Road near Kexi, passing through forests and ridges on his way to Mingzhou. After journeying twenty or thirty *li*, he suddenly lost the familiar path. Wandering in confusion as dusk approached, he found no place to rest. Then he encountered a Daoist carrying a hoe, who guided him. The Daoist said, \"The nearest homes are far off, and there is no lodging to be had. If you do not mind humble accommodations, you may stay at my hut.\"\n\nHe led the traveler to his home, where the forest path was secluded and the mountain valley serene. After resting for some time, the Daoist cooked wild herbs and vegetable shoots for him to eat. Soon, someone knocked at the door, and a young attendant announced, \"The Hidden Cloud Abbey requests your presence for tomorrow’s feast.\"\n\nAt dawn, the Daoist departed, instructing the attendant, \"Take good care of our guest.\" The traveler then asked how long the Hidden Cloud Abbey had existed and how far it was from there. The attendant replied, \"The abbey has existed since ancient times. It lies five hundred *li* away, perpetually concealed within clouds, unseen by the world—hence its name.\"\n\nThe traveler exclaimed in surprise, \"Five hundred *li* is very far! When will your master return?\" The attendant said, \"My master’s comings and goings take but a moment.\" Soon after, the Daoist returned, urging the traveler to stay longer. But the traveler, longing for home, firmly declined and departed. The Daoist then sent the attendant to show him the old path.\n\nAfter walking two or three *li*, the traveler found the place he had come from no longer recognizable. Upon inquiry, he learned that three or four years had passed. He immediately returned to search again, but the location could no longer be found.\n\n**Fei Xuanzhen**\n\nFei Xuanzhen was a Daoist of Xingtang Abbey in Shuangliu County, Chengdu. In the final years of the Dazhong era, a Daoist calling himself Wuzi arrived and stayed at the abbey. He lingered for over a year, cultivating qi and abstaining from grain, though he occasionally drank wine. His aspirations were free and unrestrained, untroubled by worldly pursuits. One day, he suddenly said to Xuanzhen, \"I wish to paint your portrait—may I?\" Xuanzhen smiled and replied, \"If you wish to paint a portrait, you must first paint yourself.\"\n\nWuzi followed his advice, holding a mirror and dipping his brush to capture his own likeness. His strokes were lifelike, and the portrait was completed in an instant. He then composed a eulogy and two poems, leaving them for Xuanzhen. Neither the eulogy nor the poems showed any sign of deliberation. The eulogy read:\n\n*Wuzi, of no talent,\nKnows fate and follows the true.\nHis aspirations lean toward the mysterious and plain,\nHis heart delights in purity and poverty.\nHe wanders through countless mountains,\nA solitary figure.\nHis learning has not yet illuminated the Dao,\nBut his form preserves the spirit.\nMountains and rivers are his home,\nHis shadow his only companion.\nClad in hempen robes and a grass belt,\nA deer-hide cap and gauze turban.\nHe eats pine nuts and drinks from springs,\nTraversing Shu and passing through Qin.\nThe great Dao is profound and obscure—\nWho is my teacher?\nGazing upon the earth below,\nI long for the celestial guests above.\nBoundless and untethered,\nI am intimate only with the formless.*\n\nThe poems read:\n\n*All day in the thatched hall I inquire,\nThe clear wind ever comes and goes.\nMy ears are free from worldly clamor,\nMy heart at ease with the vast clouds.\nFacing wine, I think only of the moon,\nFeasting on pine, I tire not of the mountains.\nOften I chant the Inner Landscape,\nNaturally preserving a youthful face.*\n\n*This life, these things—my livelihood,\nWhite stones and green pines are my home.\nFacing the moon, I see clouds like wild deer,\nFrom time to time, I buy wine to intoxicate with mist and rosy clouds.*\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n*Silent and solitary in my wanderings,\nI stand alone in stillness.\nI drink the dew that falls from magnolias,\nClothe myself in the shed fur of beasts.\nI seek no profit in the human world,\nNor sell my name beneath the heavens.\nSuch is the Daoist who dwells in the mountains.*\n\nHaving inscribed these words, he adjusted his robes, gathered his staff, and departed—no one knew where he went.\n\n**Bai Zhuangfu**\nBai Zhuangfu, styled Yongnian, was a native of Mount Heng in Hunan. From youth, he harbored lofty aspirations and studied the Way of immortals. On the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, he would visit the various abbeys of the mountain, assisting in the rituals of incense-burning and morning audiences, and inquiring into the profound classics and the mysteries of the true. His conduct was greatly admired by those of refined sensibilities. Even in tasks like gathering firewood and drawing water, he diligently sought instruction from masters, never considering it beneath him.\n\nHaving obtained the alchemical scriptures, he mastered the arts of pacing the void and dispelling malevolence. After twenty years of cultivation, he thereby aided the common folk and saved the people, punishing demonic foxes and curing illnesses—many relied on his power. When the rebel bandits besieged the capital and the imperial cortege fled west, the realm was plunged into chaos, its order unraveling. Warlords and violent chieftains arose everywhere, defying law and discipline. The Master invariably admonished them with the principles of right and wrong, and many heeded his teachings.\n\nAt that time, there was a powerful warlord in the region—his name now lost—who once arranged a marriage for his son. On the morning before the wedding day, a youth suddenly appeared, accompanied by over ten riders, their origin unknown. He strode directly into the hall, sat with legs splayed, and berated the warlord: *\"I had first sought to betroth the daughter of such-and-such a family—why have you stolen her?\"* Though the household was alarmed, none dared respond. The youth then ordered his followers to retrieve the betrothal gifts—bundles of deep-red lambskin, black silk coins, and bolts of fine cloth—and return them, demanding the bride be handed over. Suspecting him to be a demonic entity, the warlord had no means to resist. He dispatched a swift runner over a hundred *li* to summon the Master and seek his aid.\n\nAs the Master approached, the youth showed no fear. After a long while, he suddenly muttered to himself: *\"The Venerable Master Bai has indeed come.\"* Then, weeping bitterly, he leapt onto the roof, let out several wails, and vanished. The returned betrothal gifts remained, and the Master distributed them to the poor and ailing. He expounded the principles of retribution and moral order to the warlord, who, recognizing his wrongdoing, disbanded his fortifications, relaxed his military defenses, and returned to the register of common folk. The provincial governor and prefects praised his conduct, and throughout the regions of Hunan and Hengyang, whether in matters of worth or unworthiness, all extolled the Master’s virtue and revered his teachings.\n\nOne day, a woodcutter knocked at his door and said: *\"On the western peak, immortals are gathered in conversation—you should go to them.\"* The Master suspected the woodcutter might be a mountain spirit in disguise. He fixed his gaze upon the man’s eyes to discern truth from falsehood. Just as he gathered his robes to depart, the woodcutter said: *\"Your merit and conduct are already recorded in the registers of immortality—what demon would dare deceive you? Yet even the slightest misstep may bring regret.\"* With that, he took another path and left. The Master followed with his staff, but by the time he arrived, dusk had fallen. He saw only a radiant glow upon the cliff face. Peering closely, he found a poem there, its ink still fresh:\n\n*On a clear autumn day, with nothing to do,*\n*I ride the mist to the distant sky.*\n*Relying on the woodcutter’s words,*\n*I await Bai Yongnian’s arrival.*\n\nAs soon as he finished reading, the characters vanished from the blank wall, and the light faded. The woodcutter was nowhere to be seen.\n\n**Li Yan**\nDuring his tenure as military governor of Qiannan, Li Yan governed a region where Anju Mountain stood—a towering cliff hundreds of feet high, overlooking a river, with a sacred cave at its summit. The locals did not know its name but believed immortals dwelled there. Those who sought to pay homage would sail beneath it and strike the side of their boat, whereupon clouds and fragrant vapors would arise in response. The villagers reported this to Lord Li, who ordered Daoist priests to embark in a great vessel, preparing pure vegetarian offerings and solemn rites. Dozens of true immortals then descended in succession upon the cliff’s peak to observe the ceremony. For three or four days, they remained visible. Even now, those who make supplications there often catch glimpses of them.\n\n**Li Ban**\nLi Ban was a man of the Fu Qin dynasty, fond of Daoist arts. He often wandered the caves of Youchuan Mountain southwest of Weiguo County. The mountain’s streams flowed year-round, appearing like white silk from a distance, and gourd leaves would sometimes drift upon the water. Li Ban entered the cave and followed it for over three hundred paces until he emerged into a vast, luminous space. Within stood halls, beds, scriptures, and tables. Two white-haired elders with forked topknots sat facing each other on a dais. Li Ban bowed before them, and one turned to him, saying: *\"You should return—it is not fitting to linger.\"* He took his leave and, upon reaching the cave’s mouth, found several gourds. As he reached to eat one, it turned to stone. Following the same path home, his family told him: *\"You have been gone forty years.\"*\n\n**Pei Chen**\nPei Chen served as the Prefectural Administrator of Tongzhou. His second cousin once traveled from Luoyang to Zhengzhou. As evening fell, he heard groans from the roadside. Dismounting, he pushed through the undergrowth and found an ailing crane—its wings drooping, its feathers molting from festering sores. Moved by its cries, he pitied it. Suddenly, an old man in white, leaning on a staff, appeared and said: *\"Young sir, how could you understand compassion for this crane? If you were to apply human blood to its wounds, it would surely fly again.\"* Pei, well-versed in Daoist teachings and of a lofty disposition, immediately replied: *\"I will cut my arm—blood is no difficulty.\"* The old man said: *\"Your resolve is admirable, but it must be the blood of one who has lived three lifetimes...\"*\n\n**Tang**\n...already several hundred years old, he concealed himself and received visitors. He stayed the night, and at midnight, called to his daughter: *\"Bring the crescent moon child.\"* She affixed the moon to the wall—no larger than a sheet of paper. Tang rose and prayed: *\"Tonight we have a guest—grant us light.\"* As soon as he spoke, the room brightened as if candles had been lit. *(Recorded in *The Kettle History*)*\n\n**Master Lu of the Mountain**\n\n**Master Lu of the Mountain**\n\nDuring the Baoli era, Master Lu was often seen at the southern grass market of Baibo, trading in quicklime. For years, those who encountered him witnessed many strange occurrences. The merchant Zhao Yuanging, a man fond of unusual affairs, sought to travel with him. He frequently purchased Lu’s goods, offered melons and tea, and inquired about his profits. Lu, sensing his intent, said: *\"I see your purpose lies not in trade—what do you seek?\"* Zhao replied: *\"I have heard, venerable one, that you conceal your form and hide your virtue, seeing through the past like a tortoise or a diviner. I humbly beg a single word of guidance.\"*\n\nLu smiled and said: *\"Today shall serve as proof. At noon, the master of this house will face an extraordinary calamity. Someone will intrude with ill intent—warn his wife and children not to respond lightly. Let them shut the door and retreat to the waterside to avoid it. The cost will be no more than three strings and four hundred coins, and no great harm will come. Otherwise, the disaster will be severe. You may go and tell him this directly.\"*\n\nAt the time, Zhao was staying at Zhang’s home. He relayed Lu’s words to Zhang, who, having long known of Lu’s divine nature, promptly shut his door and waited. As noon approached, a pastry-maker arrived, carrying a sack as Lu had described. He knocked, demanding to be let in, and grew furious when no one answered, kicking the door and hurling abuse. A crowd gathered as Zhang and his family slipped out the back gate to avoid him. By noon, the man departed. A few steps later, he suddenly collapsed and died.\n\nAfter some time, the man’s wife arrived, wailing and demanding the authorities be summoned. The official, unable to settle the matter fairly, questioned the onlookers, who all testified to Zhang’s closed-door retreat. The official declared: *\"Zhang bears no guilt. Let him prepare a seat and burial goods instead.\"* The wife, relieved, agreed, and the cost came to exactly three strings and four hundred coins.\n\nFrom then on, people flocked to Lu like a marketplace. Unable to bear the attention, he eventually departed.\n\nOnce, he said to Zhao: \"In the world, there are no few assassins who can conceal their forms, nor are there few pursuers who can track those who hide. After twenty years of pursuit, one may change name and appearance, and after another twenty, one’s name may be listed among the earthly immortals. Such tales are often strange indeed.\"\n\nZhao remarked that Lu’s appearance shifted between old and young, and that he was never seen eating or drinking. He also recalled an incident in the market of Fuzhou, where Lu walked with several companions and encountered six or seven men dressed in fine robes, reeking of wine. Lu rebuked them, saying: \"Where are you lot bound? Do you not value your lives?\" Soon after, the six or seven men prostrated themselves in the dust, crying: \"We dare not, we dare not.\" The companions were astonished, but Lu explained: \"These are all river bandits.\" Such were his marvels—clearly one of the Dao-concealed immortals.\n\n**Quan Tongxiu, a friend of Quan Tongxiu:**\nDuring the Yuanhe era, he sat for the imperial examinations but failed. The following year, he traveled among the lakes and seas, where he fell ill and into poverty. A villager hired him as a laborer, and he had already served for a year. While still unwell, the scholar craved sweet bean soup and sent the laborer to buy licorice. The laborer prepared the fire and water but never purchased the herb. Suspecting laziness, the scholar did not press the matter. Suddenly, he saw the laborer break off a small tree branch, rub it in his hands, and hold it near the fire—whereupon it turned into licorice. The laborer then took some sand from the hall, shaped it into beans, and made soup that tasted no different from the real thing. The scholar was astounded.\n\nWhen his illness had somewhat abated, he said to the laborer: \"I have been poor and ill for a long time. Now that I am recovering, I intend to travel elsewhere. I wish to buy some wine and meat to gather the village elders, but I lack the means for provisions.\" The laborer then chopped down a withered mulberry tree, fashioned several baskets of kindling, piled them on a tray, and sprinkled them with water—whereupon they turned into beef. He drew water and transformed it into wine, and when the village elders arrived, all drank and ate their fill. The scholar received thirty bolts of silk as gifts.\n\nHe then addressed the laborer: \"I have been arrogant in my encounter with a Daoist master—my error is grave. Henceforth, I beg to serve you as a disciple.\" The laborer replied: \"In my youth, I made mistakes and became a lowly hireling. My service to you has its term; do not ask me to alter our usual ways, lest I fail in my task.\" Though the scholar agreed, he often hesitated, uneasy with the laborer’s commands. The laborer then took his leave, discoursing on the cycles of life and fortune, and adding that all things in the world could be transformed—except for the red veins in stagnant mud and fallen hair, which no medicine could alter. After speaking, he departed, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\n*Collected Works of Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*\n*Records of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Two (concluded)*\n\nThe Imperial Censor Yao\n\nThe Imperial Censor Yao—his given name is lost. Zheng Quanshu, Prefect of Zhengzhou, recounts: After Yao was dismissed from office, he resided in Zuoyi County of Pu. He had one son and two nephews, each of a different surname, all grown yet stubborn and unworthy. Yao’s son was slightly older than his two nephews. Yao, vexed by his son’s refusal to study, daily admonished and reproached him, yet the boy remained idle and undisciplined. Thereupon, Yao built a thatched hut on the southern slope of Mount Tiao, where he secluded his son, cutting off all external affairs so that he might devote himself wholly to learning. The forests and ravines were deep and layered, untouched by the clamor of the world.\n\nOn the day of his son’s departure, Yao warned him: “At each seasonal examination, I shall test your progress. If you fail to improve, I will surely flog you. You must all apply yourselves diligently.” Yet upon arriving in the mountains, the two nephews never once opened a book, busying themselves instead with chopping wood and breaking stones. After several months, the eldest said to them: “The examination period draws near. You have not studied at all—I fear for you.” The two paid no heed, while the eldest studied with great diligence.\n\nOne night, as he sat reading by candlelight at his desk, he felt his fur robe tugged from behind. The collar gradually slipped down, yet he thought nothing of it. He adjusted it, but soon it happened again—several times in succession. Turning to look, he saw a small creature crouched upon his robe, its fur pure white and lustrous as jade. He struck it with his ruler, and the creature shrieked and fled. He called to his two companions, and together they searched the hall with candles, but the doors and windows were tightly sealed, and no trace of the creature could be found.\n\nThe next day, a gray-haired servant arrived on horseback, knocking at the gate. He entered with a staff and addressed the three: “The Lady sends her regards. Last night, her youngest son, in his ignorance, mistakenly crept into your robe. She apologizes for the disturbance. However, your blow injured him severely. He has now recovered—do not worry.” The three bowed in apology, exchanging glances, unable to fathom the matter.\n\nShortly after, the same servant returned, cradling the injured child along with several nursemaids and infants, all clad in fine silk garments of exquisite craftsmanship, unlike anything seen before. He conveyed the Lady’s words: “My son is unharmed, and I bring him to show you.” Upon closer inspection, a red mark like carved cinnabar stretched from his brow to the bridge of his nose—the imprint of the ruler’s strike. The three grew even more alarmed. The servant and nursemaids spoke soothingly to reassure them, adding that the Lady herself would arrive shortly. As soon as she departed, the three resolved to flee in terror and confusion.\n\nBefore long, a group of gray-haired servants and dozens of purple-robed palace attendants arrived in haste, bearing before them screens, canopies, and woven mats—all resplendent and gleaming—while an extraordinary fragrance filled the air. Soon after, a lacquered carriage drawn by a black ox with vermilion wheels approached like the wind, escorted by hundreds of fine horses. Upon reaching the gate, the occupant alighted—it was the Lady.\n\nThe three men hurried out to bow twice in greeting. The Lady smiled faintly and said, “I did not expect my son to trouble you so. The injury you inflicted yesterday was no cause for great alarm, but I came to ease your concerns.” She appeared to be around thirty, her bearing graceful and composed, her every movement divine—yet none could tell who she was. She asked the three, “Are you married?” They all replied that they were not. The Lady said, “I have three daughters, each of surpassing beauty and virtue, who would make fitting matches for you three gentlemen.” The three bowed in thanks. The Lady then lingered, ordering separate courtyards built for each of them. In the blink of an eye, painted halls and towering pavilions materialized as if conjured from the clouds.\n\nThe next day, carriages arrived, their wheels rumbling, accompanied by attendants more splendid than those of any noble house. The gleam of their robes and vehicles lit the earth, their fragrance perfuming the mountains and valleys. The three daughters descended from their carriages, each seventeen or eighteen years old. The Lady led them into the hall and invited the three men to take their seats. The feast was lavish, the wine and delicacies beyond anything in the mortal world, many of the fruits unfamiliar. The three men could scarcely believe their fortune. The Lady gestured to her daughters and said, “Each is to be wed to one of you.” They rose from their seats to bow in gratitude. Dozens of maidservants, radiant as immortals, were sent to attend the brides.\n\nThat night, after the wedding rites were completed, the Lady addressed the three men: “What men value most is life, and what they desire most is rank. If you keep this secret for a hundred days, I will grant you longevity beyond this world and positions at the pinnacle of the court.” The three bowed again, though they fretted over their own ignorance and lack of refinement. The Lady reassured them, “Have no fear. I am the sovereign of this earthly realm. I shall summon Confucius.”\n\nIn an instant, Confucius arrived, fully robed and girded with a sword. The Lady stood solemnly and greeted him with a slight bow, then said, “My three sons-in-law wish to study. You shall guide them.” Confucius instructed the three, pointing out the titles of the Six Classics. They understood everything at once, grasping the great principles as if they had long been familiar with them. When he had finished, Confucius took his leave.\n\nThe Lady then summoned the Duke of Zhou, who revealed to them the Mysterious Woman’s military talismans and the secret jade tokens of the *Yuhuang*. The three mastered them without omission. As they sat again, a messenger arrived bearing a letter from Princess Wenle, along with an imperial seal. The letter urged them to strive onward, for the court’s decree had temporarily humbled their lofty aspirations. Upon reaching the capital, they were received by nobles and officials, exchanging only the briefest courtesies before being appointed Grand Masters of the Heir Apparent and enfeoffed as Dukes. When they returned to the mountains, they were made Hanlin Academicians, and poets composed verses to see them off.\n\n---\n\n**Shuoshi of Jingzhou**\nIn Jingzhou, by the Li River, stand two stones resembling gates, called Shuoshi. During the Yonghe era of the Jin, two celestial beings, clad in snow-white robes and caps, alighted upon the stones and rested for ten days before departing. All the locals witnessed this.\n\n**Master Pan of Cao Bridge**\nAt Fuye Abbey in Cao Bridge, Hangzhou, there lived a Master Pan, a man of ample means who embraced generosity and hospitality, aiding others with both deeds and virtue. One day, a youth of striking and uncommon appearance arrived at the abbey and addressed Master Pan: “I have long heard of your virtue and righteousness, of your aid to those in dire straits. I humbly seek refuge in the thatched hut behind your bamboo grove for two months to evade a calamity. May I impose upon your kindness?” He added, “If you grant this request, do not fear I will burden you, nor worry over provisions. I ask only for two *dou* of wine, which will suffice for sixty days.”\n\nThough Master Pan could not fathom the youth’s origins, he gladly agreed upon hearing of his plight. The youth then concealed himself in the thatched hut. No one came searching for him, and he neither ate nor drank. When the sixty days had passed, he emerged to bow in gratitude. Calmly, he asked Master Pan, “Have you received any talismanic scriptures?” Master Pan replied, “I have attained the middle covenant of the *Dongxuan*, though I dare not yet delve into the highest teachings.”\n\nThe youth said, “Your rank is already exalted, but I have received the first stage of the *Zhengyi Jiuzhou Sheling Lu*. I offer it to you in repayment.” He then burned incense before the Heavenly Worthy and transmitted the names of the *Sheling* and the divine officers and generals. At his summons, soldiers and cavalry appeared at once. When the rites were complete, he instructed them, “After this transmission, you shall follow and protect Master Pan as you do me now.” The soldiers then vanished.\n\nThe youth further told Master Pan, “In the main hall, arrange a platform with a bed and altar. Burn incense, sit in reverence, and you will know all matters of good and ill within the Nine Provinces and beyond. But do not defile it with blood or meat, lest you incur unseen retribution. If you maintain purity and caution, you may attain the immortality of the divine transcendents.” With that, he vanished, and none knew where he had gone.\n\nPan then arranged a couch and a low table, sitting reverently in the central hall. In an instant, he knew all matters great and small within the Four Seas. For ten days thus, the divine officers relayed reports, their messages incessant and clamorous. Pan grew indignant and said, “I am but a man of leisure. Why must I know the affairs of distant lands?” He strictly forbade the divine officers from delivering reports. They replied, “Our duties may not be neglected.” As the reports grew more frequent and his prohibitions went unheeded, Pan resorted to eating meat and garlic to repel them. After three to five days, the voices of the reports gradually receded, and the divine officers no longer came—vanishing entirely.\n\nOne evening, the youth reappeared and said, “I lightly transmitted the true formula and have thus incurred punishment. You have defiled the divine numen, and your offense warrants dark torment. Yet, mindful of our past forbearance, I cannot stand by and watch you fall. Seek another guardian, broadly perform hidden merits, and relieve the suffering of others to atone for your transgressions. Otherwise, you shall descend into the nether prison.” After consuming meat and garlic, Pan had known he had erred, and upon hearing these words, he was filled with extraordinary dread.\n\nThe youth then took rice crumbs and molded them into human figures, each four or five inches tall, placing them in a wall niche. He also bestowed two jade talismans upon Pan, admonishing him, “When those afflicted by suffering or calamity come seeking aid, consult the powder figures to discern the source of their misfortune, then use my talismans to save them. Do not accept money; your duty lies in accumulating merit to atone for your faults. Persevere without fail, and in ten years, I shall return.” Thereafter, Pan used cinnabar talismans to rescue others, dispelling disasters and curing illnesses. Those who sought him came like a throng to a marketplace.\n\nOver ten years later, the youth reappeared, staying for over a month. He spoke at length of matters beyond the heavens before taking his leave. A year later, Pan passed away without illness, leading others to suspect he had attained the Dao of *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\n---\n\n**Minister Lu Jun**\nMinister Lu Jun passed the imperial examination and served as a gentleman of the Ministry of Works. Due to illness, he requested to be appointed prefect of Junzhou. Upon arriving in the prefecture, his condition worsened, leaving him emaciated yet still able to receive visitors. He often retreated to a mountain studio behind the prefectural hall to cultivate his nature in solitude. His attendants kept their distance, and none dared approach without summons.\n\nSuddenly, a man in tattered clothing climbed over the wall and entered. Lu invited him in, and the man gave his surname as Wang. Asked of his origins, he replied he had come from the mountains. Lu smiled and said, “So you are Master Wang of the mountains. What instruction do you bring?” Wang replied, “Your Excellency holds the highest rank among men, yet your lifespan is not long, and misfortune now befalls you. This has brought lingering illness, which is why I come to your aid.”\n\nNoting the lack of water in the studio, Lu intended to summon servants to fetch tea, but Wang stopped him. Drawing water from the well with his sash, he dissolved a cinnabar pellet in it, wrung out the sash, and had Lu swallow the liquid. He then made an agreement: “In five days, your illness will be cured, and your health will surpass your former state. After three years, you will face a great trial. Diligently perform hidden merits, and take compassion for others as your intent. I shall return then, and we will meet at the beginning of summer.”\n\nThereafter, Lu’s illness improved, and within ten days, he fully recovered. The following year, he resigned his post and returned to the capital, where he was appointed vice-director of the Bureau of Iron and Salt. In the fourth month of summer, as he walked along the eastern road outside his office, he suddenly saw the mountain man arrive at his residence. The man rejoiced and said, “This year marks the end of your second life limit, and the calamity was severe. However, while in the prefecture last year, you exonerated a wrongful conviction and saved three lives, thereby averting the disaster. You will only face three to five days of discomfort this month, but there is no cause for concern.”\n\nThe next day, the mountain man sent two servants with ten thousand coins to distribute among the poor and sick at Gouji Slope. He then departed, saying, “On the fifth day of the fifth month, twenty-three years hence, at noon, have a Daoist await me atop Wanshan Peak. By then, you will govern Hanzhong, and I shall bestow upon you the Elixir of Golden Radiance. Do not miss the appointed time.”\n\nThereafter, Lu held a succession of esteemed posts, rising in prominence and favor. Later, he was appointed military governor of Hanzhong, and twenty-three years had passed. At the appointed time, he sent the Daoist Niu Zhiwei to ascend Wanshan Peak at noon on the fifth day. The mountain man was already there. He gave Niu two golden elixir pellets to swallow, saying, “You possess the qi of the Dao but lack hidden merits and have not yet attained the rank of the Dao. You must cultivate further.” He then presented Lu with ten golden elixir pellets, saying, “You shall enjoy a long life. Do not cease your cultivation. When your worldly limit is complete, I await your return to Penglai Palace.” He bowed to Niu and took his leave, vanishing without a trace.\n\nLater, Niu lived to over eighty, yet his appearance remained as that of a man in his thirties. Minister Lu lived to nearly ninety, his senses sharp and his vitality unwaning. After his passing, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room.\n\n---\n\n**Li Gongzuo**\nAfter passing the imperial examination, Li Gongzuo served as an aide in Zhongling. He had a servant who, though a commoner, had diligently and reverently served him day and night for nearly thirty years. Gongzuo never suspected he was an extraordinary person. One day, the servant announced his departure, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*I possess a pearl within my robe,*\n*Unmindful of the dust upon it.*\n*I hold the principle of long life,*\n*Unwearied by this mortal form.*\n*The Jiangnan is a cave of immortals,*\n*Where I shall merge with the true.*\n*Unashamed of the marketplace’s clamor,*\n*I come to save the people of the world.*\n*Su Dan’s traces are long past,*\n*(Note: Su Dan is meant.)*\n*The ignorant may yet be befriended.*\n*(Gongzuo’s courtesy name was “The Ignorant.”)*\n*Do not speak of the Eastern Sea’s transformation,*\n*For heaven and earth know eternal spring.*\n\nAfter this, he departed, and no one knew where he had gone. Neighbors saw him leap into the air and vanish into the sky.\n\nWang Zizhi, styled Xianmiao, claimed to be a native of Houshi in Henan. He often traveled between the capital and Luoyang. Elders said that for fifty years they had seen him, his appearance ever like that of a man in his forties, none knowing his true age. He cultivated qi and was fond of wine.\n\nIn the early years of Pu Prefecture’s Lord Langya Chongying’s governorship, Xianmiao arrived at the Purple Ultimate Palace. The prefect, Wang, treated him with great generosity and, learning of his love for wine, daily sent him two flasks. One day, as Xianmiao was leaving, he encountered a woodcutter at the palace gate, carrying firewood on his shoulder. The man’s appearance was extraordinary, and Xianmiao found him most unusual. He purchased the woodcutter’s firewood, paying him generously, and the woodcutter accepted the silver without demur and departed. Xianmiao sent someone to follow him and inquire. The woodcutter went straight to a tavern, drank all the wine he could, and then returned home.\n\nThe next day, the woodcutter returned and said to Xianmiao, “This wine is indeed fine, but it cannot compare to the brew of the Shi family in Jie County. I have just come from there and regret that I had no companion before to share it fully.” Xianmiao descended the steps, took his hand, and sat with him by the brazier. He entreated the woodcutter, saying, “Can the Shi family’s fragrant wine be obtained?” The woodcutter was pleased and wrote a vermilion talisman with cinnabar, placing it in the fire. Before the smoke had dissipated, a young servant appeared. The woodcutter commanded him, saying, “You, take the master’s servant and these two flasks, go to the Shi household, and fetch wine. I shall wait to drink with the master until we are drunk.” It was already deep night, and the gates were barred. The young servant said to Xianmiao’s servant, “Close your eyes.” He then lifted the servant’s head, and man and wine jars slipped through the gate’s crack. In an instant, they reached Jie County, purchased the wine, and returned. They poured it together, and its sweetness, richness, and potency were beyond anything in the mortal world.\n\nAt midnight, the woodcutter said to Xianmiao, “You are drunk. Shall I summon a guest to accompany you in drinking?” Xianmiao replied, “Very well.” The woodcutter again wrote a vermilion talisman and placed it in the fire. In the blink of an eye, a strange fragrance filled the room. A man of imposing presence entered, his brows and temples handsome, clad in purple robes, holding a tablet. He bowed and sat. The woodcutter said, “Be seated.” They drank deeply in turn, and the two flasks were soon emptied. The woodcutter heated an iron poker and warmed the purple-robed man, saying, “You may go.” By then, dawn was breaking in the east. They each took their leave, and the woodcutter said to Xianmiao, “Do you recognize the man who just left? In a little while, go to the Heze Temple and you will see him.” Xianmiao saw the woodcutter off, then visited the temple. There he saw the man with whom he had drunk the night before—it was the temple deity, the iron poker’s mark still plainly visible.\n\nAt the time, Vice Director Zhao Jun was in the prefectural office, and he personally verified this matter. Su Shui, Proofreader of the Hongwen Library, was also residing in Zhongtiao and was well acquainted with the details. Later, Xianmiao encountered the woodcutter immortal again, who transmitted to him the secrets of cultivation, and he became an earthbound immortal.\n\nHe Liang was a stable attendant at the East Slope Post Station in Shang Mountain.\n\nHaving served for twenty years, He Liang always maintained humility and caution, never daring to be negligent or idle. One cold day, rain and snow fell together, cutting off all travelers on the road. A Daoist, braving the storm, arrived with his robes and belongings soaked through. He approached every inn, but all doors were shut and none would take him in. Seeing this, Liang pitied him and invited him beneath the post station’s eaves, where he kindled a fire and prepared food for him. The Daoist stayed the night before departing. As he was about to leave, he hesitated and said, “I cannot repay your kindness without some token.” From his gourd, he took a single elixir pellet and instructed Liang to swallow it. “Within your allotted span,” he said, “you will suffer no illness.” With these words, he left.\n\nHe Liang was already over forty at the time, yet from then on his strength and vigor only grew, and he knew no more sickness or pain. By the early years of the Qianfu era, he was over ninety, yet his appearance remained that of a man in his forties—his teeth and hair showed no sign of decline. Master Feng Junjuan of Xindu once summoned him to inquire about these events. People far and near all recounted the same story, and I learned of it from Master Feng.\n\nOfficer Xue\n\nOfficer Xue once journeyed with his friend Li to the capital, both sharing the same resolve to seek the Dao. Together they wandered through famous mountains for years, yet met with no success. Later, Xue headed south into the Five Ridges, declaring his intent to seclude himself on Mount Luofu, his determination growing ever more steadfast. Li, however, turned back midway and returned to the capital, where his official career proved ill-fated. As old age pressed upon him, he and Xue had been parted for over thirty years, their bond of friendship and kinship long faded. In his later years, leaning on a staff, Li made his way to Mount Luofu to seek him out—and indeed, the two were reunited.\n\nBy then, Xue had dwelled there for many years, his Daoist arts perfected. His bearing was refined and elegant, his skin smooth as jade. Amid the mountain’s peaks stood pavilions and terraces, wind-swept kiosks and moonlit pavilions—all unlike anything found in the mortal world. Seeing Li’s emaciated and withered appearance, Xue was deeply moved with pity. He said, “Though you wish to stay here, you cannot remain for long.” He then gave Li a generous gift of gold and treasures, and ordered his female musicians to hold a feast in his honor.\n\nAs Li was about to depart, Xue noticed his teeth were all missing. When asked the reason, Li explained, “Previously, while playing with a ball, I damaged them. I kept the broken teeth in my sash.” He took them out for Xue to examine. Xue had the female musicians clean off the grime, then used a small knife to scrape the broken edges before reattaching two teeth. He sent Li on his way with a warning not to speak of it. By the time Li reached the foot of the mountain, the teeth had already firmly set. Over the next ten years, all of Li’s other teeth rotted and fell out, yet the two that had been restored remained firmly in place, unchanged.\n\nMaster Rong, a teacher surnamed Zhang, had been appointed from the position of *Geishizhong* to govern this region. After more than a year, he fell gravely ill from miasmic vapors, his condition worsening month by month. A devotee of Buddhism, he placed no trust in talismans or medicines, even when others claimed they were effective. His family, retainers, and officers were deeply concerned. Vice-Commissioner Feng, the Master of Xindu, secretly told one of Zhang’s close attendants, “Officer Xue of Mount Luofu possesses profound Daoist arts and has relieved many of their suffering. People near and far rely on him. You should send a messenger bearing a token of sincerity to seek his aid.”\n\nThus, a messenger was dispatched to find him, and his dwelling was indeed located. Upon hearing the request, Xue took pity and said to the messenger, “Convey my thanks to Prefect Zhang for sending gifts from afar to this mountain retreat. I have no paper or brush here, so I cannot send a letter in reply. As for his illness, there is no need for concern. Once the messenger arrives, have them sweep and purify the courtyard and maintain a strict fast for three days—there will naturally be a response.”\n\nFollowing his instructions, on the third day, the entire residence was filled with a strange and fragrant aroma, though nothing else was seen. Yet Prefect Zhang’s illness was cured. Another messenger was sent bearing gifts and silk to express gratitude, but this time, the envoy lost the path and could never again find the place.\n\nThis was surely one of the ranks of earthbound immortals. I, too, learned of this account from the Master of Xindu.\n\n*Records of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Three* concludes here.\n\nShe Fan\n\nShe Fan was a native of Shu. From childhood, he was drawn to the Dao, and once formed a bond with three like-minded companions, swearing brotherhood. Together, they roamed the mountains, gathering esoteric arts. At the gates of Mount Emei, they made a pact: “This mountain is the abode of immortals—there must be places here where the Dao may be sought. Let us three part ways, each entering a different valley, to see if any of us encounters anything.”\n\nThey separated, and Fan entered the Valley of Wooden Bark. After five or six *li*, he came upon four old men seated on a great boulder, a large platter of simmering meat before them as they ate. They beckoned Fan to sit and offered him a portion. Fan declined, saying, “I seek the Dao of immortals and have long since renounced meat and blood—this is no affectation.”\n\nThe old men smiled and said, “Since you seek the Dao, enter this valley, and you will surely find what you seek.”\n\nFan proceeded into the valley. After several dozen *li*, he saw pavilions and terraces of such splendor that they could not have been of this world. At the gate stood several Daoists, who asked how he had come there. He recounted his journey in full. One of them studied Fan intently for a long while, then led him to a great hall where statues stood in solemn array. Before the image of the Heavenly Worthy lay stacks of scriptures upon the table. The Daoist told Fan to close his eyes, reach out at random, and take one volume. He then handed it to him, saying, “This is the *Celestial Script in Great Seal Script*. Practicing it will grant you longevity and transcendence, allow you to accumulate merit and save others. But this is not a place for you to linger—you must go now.”\n\nFan took leave of the Daoists, departed the mountain with the scripture, and lodged at a household near the valley’s entrance. There, a child had fallen into boiling water, his flesh scalded in several places. The entire household was in distress, with no means of saving him. Fan consulted the *Celestial Script* and found a passage marked for such treatment. He transcribed the characters, mixed the ashes with water, and washed the child’s wounds—by the time he had finished, the child was fully healed.\n\nFrom then on, Fan often used the *Celestial Script* to perform hidden acts of merit and save others. Those who benefited from his powers were beyond counting. When Lord Bin, the Military Commissioner, governed Chengdu, he summoned Fan to his service and treated him with exceptional courtesy. When the lord later journeyed to the capital for an audience, Fan accompanied him to Chang’an.\n\nOne day, a member of Lord Bin’s family fell gravely ill. Physicians filled the house, but none could effect a cure. The lord suddenly recalled Fan’s divine script, and hastily summoned him. Fan arrived, took up his brush, and wrote the characters—no sooner had he finished than the patient recovered. Gold and silk were offered as gifts, amounting to tens of thousands, but Fan accepted nothing.\n\nLater, he returned to Shu and wandered among the mountains, vanishing without a trace.\n\n---\n\nZheng Youxuan\n\nZheng Youxuan was the scion of a noble family in Chang’an. As a boy, he studied alongside a neighbor’s son, Wenqiu, under the same master. Youxuan was proud and blunt, considering his lineage pure and exalted, while Wenqiu was of humble birth. Often, he mocked and berated him, saying, “You are no kin to me—how dare you study at my side? Even if I say nothing, do you feel no shame?”\n\nWenqiu’s face darkened with resentment, and within a year, he died.\n\nA decade later, Youxuan passed the imperial examinations with distinction and was appointed as a military advisor in Shuzhou. Upon taking office, the prefect ordered him to serve as a magistrate in Tangxing. Among his colleagues was a young man named Qiu, the son of a wealthy merchant, who had just come of age. His family’s wealth was vast, and he often feasted and roamed with Youxuan, showering him with gold and gifts. Yet Youxuan, considering Qiu beneath his station, never treated him with proper courtesy.\n\nOne day, Youxuan hosted a grand banquet but did not invite Qiu. As the feast drew to a close, someone said to Youxuan, “Qiu shares your office—why was he not invited? Has he committed some offense?”\n\nYouxuan hesitated, then summoned Qiu. When he arrived, Youxuan handed him a goblet, but Qiu declined, saying he could not drink it all. Youxuan grew furious and cursed him: “You lowborn cur, fit only for counting coins—how dare you presume to hold office? That I even deign to associate with you is your good fortune—how dare you refuse my wine!”\n\nHe rose in a huff, and Qiu, his face flushed with anger, withdrew. He resigned his post, shut himself away, and within a month, died of illness.\n\nThe following year, Youxuan’s term ended, and he took up residence in Mengyang, where he developed an interest in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Hearing of a certain Master Wu in the mountains of Shu, Youxuan admired his reputation and sought him out, wishing to become his disciple. He remained with the master for nearly a decade but received no transmission of teachings. Growing restless, he took his leave and returned.\n\nLater, while passing through Chang’an, he lodged in Baocheng. At the inn, he met a boy of ten or so, fair and quick-witted. Youxuan spoke with him, and the boy’s wit and eloquence astonished him. The boy said, “You and I have been old acquaintances for years—do you not remember?”\n\nYouxuan replied, “I have forgotten.”\n\nThe boy said, “I was once Wenqiu, living in Chang’an. You studied with me but deemed me unworthy, insulting and humiliating me. Later, I was reborn as Qiu, the son of a merchant family, and served as a magistrate in Tangxing. You accepted my generous gifts yet called me a ‘lowborn cur.’ How could you be so arrogant? You, born to a family of scholars, trampled upon others—was that the Way?”\n\n“I am a Perfected One of the Great Clarity.”\n\nThe Celestial Emperor, seeing that you possessed the qi of the Dao, caused me to be born among men to befriend you, intending to bestow upon you the secrets of divine transcendence. Yet you were reckless, haughty, and arrogant—thus you could never attain the Way. Alas, how lamentable! With these words, he suddenly vanished.\n\nYouxuan, awakening to his sins, fell gravely ill and soon perished.\n\n---\n\n**Lu Daoliu**\nLu Daoliu was a man of unknown origins. At over seventy years of age, he told fortunes in the markets of Luoyang. One day, he fell severely ill for more than ten days, his condition growing perilous. Hearing that the recluse Cheng Xiuyi often traveled between the two capitals and had performed many wondrous deeds—being one who had attained the Dao—Lu informed him of his illness. Cheng took from his gourd a cinnabar pellet, fine as a mustard seed, and ground it in a white porcelain bowl with a few drops of wine. He then inscribed the characters for \"Two Celestial Envoys\" inside the bowl and gave it to Lu to drink with the wine. Lu’s illness immediately vanished.\n\nShortly after, as Lu was returning from Xuan Yuan Temple and nearing the city, he passed by the Valley River. The heat was oppressive, so he bathed in the water. Suddenly, the river surged, its crest rising over ten feet. Lu was swept away more than a hundred paces before two Celestial Envoys appeared on the bank, urging melon farmers to wade in and rescue him. He was barely saved. Upon reaching the shore, the two envoys vanished. It was the inscribed characters of the \"Two Celestial Envoys\" that had secretly delivered him from this calamity.\n\nDuring the Tianfu era, Cheng arrived in Chang’an and told others, “The Five Ridges are a refuge from the world.” Claiming to seek cinnabar, he entered Guiyang and was never heard from again.\n\n---\n\n**Cheng Sheng**\nCheng Sheng came from an immensely wealthy family that had long resided in Lingkou. Among his uncles, the seventh was devoted to the Dao. In his early years, he donned hempen robes and wandered the Huayin Mountains, returning home only occasionally. After the Xiantong era, his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nWhen the great famine breached the passes and Emperor Zhaozong fled in distress, Cheng Sheng’s family was scattered, and his livelihood reduced to poverty. One day, his uncle unexpectedly returned home, moved by pity and sorrow. He stayed for several days before taking Cheng Sheng’s son to the Sand Gardens of Tongzhou.\n\nUpon arriving at his dwelling—a grand estate with towering pavilions and gates resembling a palace—he left the boy outside. After a long while, he returned with a bundle of clothing and utensils, which he gave to the boy to take home for his family’s support. Upon opening it, they found tens of thousands of gold coins. Cheng Sheng was astonished, realizing his uncle had attained the Dao.\n\nThe next day, he and his son returned to search for him, but his whereabouts were unknown. From then on, Cheng Sheng’s family was well provided for.\n\nOutside the gate, a stone chime had stood for fifty or sixty years, serving as a barrier for carriages and horses. His uncle had ordered it moved into the courtyard. Suspecting it was unusual, Cheng Sheng had it chiseled open, revealing five *jin* of cinnabar. When word spread, some told others outside, and it was seized by a powerful figure in the military.\n\nWhat a pity! Was this not the cinnabar of immortals, the supreme elixir of divine transcendence? And now it was lost.\n\n**Xu Dingguo**\n\nXu Dingguo was registered in the Right Three Armies and possessed great physical strength. During the Dazhong era, an imperial edict selected thirty men to escort Master Xuanyuan to Mount Luofu, and Dingguo was among those chosen. Upon arriving at the mountain, he claimed illness and began taking medicinal preparations, thus securing permission to remain. He then served Master Xuanyuan with the rites of a servant, attending to his needs. At the time, Dingguo was already over sixty years old. After several years, the Master sent him back to Chang’an, his appearance having grown younger, swift as a galloping horse. By the Tianfu era, he was no less than a hundred years old, yet his vigor resembled that of a man of forty.\n\n**Master Lu of Huayuan in Jingzhao**\nIn the boundary of Liyang in Huayuan, Jingzhao, stood an ancient Daoist abbey. There resided Master Lu, who had attained the Dao of *zuowang* (sitting in forgetfulness) during the Sui dynasty, yet his physical form remained preserved. During the Qianning era, an official on a mission to the northern capital encountered the Master in his lodgings. They conversed and laughed as old friends, staying together for ten days. Upon learning where the Master resided, the official, upon returning to the capital, requested leave to visit his villa. In a small hall, he saw the likeness of Master Lu, unchanged from their meeting in the northern capital.\n\nThere was a scholar named Yao who carried the *Huangting Jing*. At the beginning of the Guangqi era, when Emperor Xizong fled again to Liang and Yang, Yao was pursued by bandits and fled in the night to evade them. He accidentally fell into a well beside the abbey, injuring his foot. He then dug a side chamber in the well-shaft to tend to his injury. The village was desolate and overgrown, and no one came to his aid.\n\nWith no practice of cultivation to sustain him, he simply recited the *Huangting Jing* and the *Daode Jing* day and night. He felt no hunger, and his foot injury healed. He had no sense of how many months or years he had spent in the well-shaft.\n\nAfter Xiangwang was pacified and the imperial cortege returned to the capital, a patrol of soldiers lodged at the abbey. At night, they saw a radiant light emanating from the well and, upon investigating, brought him out. Moved by the protective power of the true scriptures, Yao became a Daoist and took up residence at the abbey.\n\n**The Ten Immortals of Emperor Ming**\nEmperor Ming once dreamed of ten immortals descending on rosy clouds to his courtyard, each holding a musical instrument and playing a melody. The tune was clear and transcendent, truly the music of the immortal realm. When the music ended, one immortal stepped forward and said: *\"Does Your Majesty recognize this music? This is the immortal melody *Ziyun Qu*. We now wish to transmit it to you as the proper foundation of sound for the sacred Tang. It is not the same as the *Xianchi* or *Daxia* of old.\"*\n\nThe emperor was overjoyed and immediately received the transmission. Upon waking, the lingering echoes still seemed to resonate in his ears. He ordered a jade flute and practiced the melody until he mastered its rhythm, resolving to keep it secret. The next morning, as he held court in the Zichen Hall, his chief ministers Yao Chong and Song Jing entered to present state affairs. The emperor sat in silence, as if he had not heard them. The two ministers grew alarmed and repeated their report. The emperor rose, descended the steps, and gazed at the officials assembled in the courtyard, yet paid them no heed. The ministers, now deeply fearful, withdrew.\n\nThe eunuch Gao Lishi then addressed the emperor: *\"The chief ministers have matters to present. Should Your Majesty not grant them an audience? The matters they raised earlier concern the very security of the state, yet you ignored them. Have the ministers committed some offense?\"*\n\nThe emperor laughed and said: *\"Last night, I dreamed of ten immortals playing a melody called *Ziyun Qu*, which they then taught to me. I feared forgetting its rhythm, so I silently practiced it and had no time to attend to the ministers.\"* With that, he drew a jade flute from his robe and showed it to Gao Lishi.\n\nThat day, Gao Lishi went to the Chancellery and recounted the matter to the two ministers. Their fear abated somewhat, and the melody was later transmitted to the Music Bureau.\n\n**The Bearded Daoist Brother**\nThere was a Daoist brother known as the Bearded Guest, whose name and origins were unknown.\n\nAt the end of Emperor Yang’s reign, when the Grand Chancellor Yang Su was left in charge of Chang’an while the emperor traveled to Jiangdu, Yang held power with such arrogance and haughtiness that he scorned all worldly sentiment. Duke Wei, Li Jing, had twice sought an audience with him, and thus encountered Yang’s attendant courtesan, Hongfu. The courtesan, surnamed Zhang and known as \"First,\" sensed that Yang’s downfall was imminent and soon abandoned him to flee with Jing. Together they departed the Western Capital, bound for Taiyuan. At an inn in Lingshi, they dismounted to rest, where they encountered the Bearded Guest. He was a man of imposing stature, with a fiery red beard, and he arrived clad in tattered robes, riding a lame donkey. He tossed his cloth sack to the ground, took out a pillow, and lay down outside, watching as Zhang combed her hair, which cascaded to the floor. She stood brushing it by the bed. Jing, observing the bearded man, grew furious and could not help but glare at him. Zhang, studying the stranger’s face intently, held her hair with one hand while shielding herself with the other, signaling Jing to suppress his anger. Once she had hastily finished combing her hair, she straightened her robes and stepped forward to ask his surname. The man outside replied, \"Zhang.\" She said, \"I, too, am surnamed Zhang—we must be sisters.\" She promptly bowed to him. \"What is your birth order?\" she asked. \"Third,\" he replied. \"And yours?\" \"I am the eldest,\" she said. Delighted, he exclaimed, \"Today I am fortunate to meet a younger sister!\" Zhang called out to Jing from a distance, \"Master Li, come and pay respects to Third Brother.\" Jing thus bowed to him. They sat in a circle, cutting meat to share. The guest fed the scraps to his donkey and laughed, \"Master Li is but a poor scholar—how have you come by such an extraordinary figure?\" Jing recounted the full story. The guest said, \"So it is. But where are you headed?\"\n\nHe replied, \"To seek refuge in Taiyuan.\" They ordered more wine and drank together. The guest then asked, \"Have you ever heard of the extraordinary figures in Taiyuan?\" Jing said, \"The governor’s son, about eighteen years old, surnamed Li.\" The guest said, \"He may resemble one, but I must see him for myself. Can you arrange a meeting, Master Li?\" Jing replied, \"My friend Liu Wenjing is very close to him—he can certainly arrange it.\" The guest observed the qi and said, \"Let me visit him.\" They set a date to meet at Fenyang Bridge.\n\nWhen the day came, the guest arrived as promised. Jing told Wenjing, \"I have a skilled physiognomist who wishes to meet you. May I bring him here?\" Wenjing, who had long admired the young man and was considering supporting him, immediately prepared wine to welcome them. Together, they met the Crown Prince. He arrived without formal robes or shoes, dressed in a coarse fur coat, his spirit soaring, utterly unlike an ordinary man. The guest saw him and fell silent, taking the lowest seat, his qi drained and spirit crushed. After a few cups of wine, he beckoned Jing and said, \"This is truly the Son of Heaven.\" Jing relayed this to Liu, who rejoiced even more.\n\nAfter they left, Hongxu said, \"I saw him and confirmed eight or nine parts of it, but we must also have Dao-Brother see him.\" He then arranged for Jing and his sister to meet at the Horse Market’s eastern wine tower in the capital. When they arrived, they ascended the tower and saw Hongxu drinking with a Daoist. They all sat together, and Hongxu proposed that the Daoist accompany them to Taiyuan. The Daoist played chess with Liu Wenjing while Hongxu and Jing joined them. The Prince arrived, his brilliance striking, and with a deep bow, he took his seat. His spirit was clear, his qi refreshing, filling the room with vitality, his presence majestic. At first sight, the Daoist paled and dropped his chess piece, saying, \"This game is lost. To lose here is extraordinary! There is no way to salvage it—what more can be said?\" After the game ended, he stepped outside and told Hongxu, \"This world is not yours. Seek another realm. Take heart and do not dwell on it.\"\n\nThey returned to the capital together. Hongxu instructed his wife and sister to meet Master Li. His wife, too, was a celestial being. Hongxu arrived in a gauze turban and coarse fur coat, carrying a slingshot. They entered the main hall, where music and revelry filled the air. Over thirty female musicians played, a spectacle not even found in the households of kings and marquises, as if a gathering in a cave heaven. Then, twenty beds were brought in, covered with embroidered quilts. Hongxu removed the quilts and said, \"These are merely ledgers and keys. They contain treasures, coins, and goods—all of which I now gift to you. I had intended to seek opportunities in the Central Plains, perhaps enduring a few years of dragon-like strife, using these as funds. But now that there is a true lord, what need is there? The Li family of Taiyuan is a true hero. Within three to five years, there will be great peace. Master Li’s sister is well-suited to assist him—none but she can aid such a wise ruler. Take heed!\"\n\n\"Ten years from now, thousands of miles to the southeast, something extraordinary will occur—that will be my time to serve. When you hear of it, secretly celebrate with wine.\" He then summoned over a hundred servants to bow, saying, \"Master Li’s sister is your new mistress.\" With that, he and his wife mounted horses in military attire and departed. The Daoist, too, vanished without a trace.\n\nJing, inspired by these events, devoted himself to aiding the Prince, helping to forge a great enterprise. During the Zhenguan era, a report came from the southeastern barbarians: a sea pirate with a thousand ships and over a hundred thousand soldiers had seized Fuyu, killed its ruler, and declared himself king. The land was now at peace. Jing, knowing Hongxu had succeeded, told his wife and poured wine toward the southeast in celebration. Thus, it was clear that the rise of a true ruler was ordained by Heaven—how could mediocre men dare to recklessly plot rebellion?\n\n---\n\nThe Dongming Oil Merchant\n\nThe Dongming Oil Merchant, whose name is unknown, often carried his load to sell oil in the nearby wards. He had lived for several years in a humble dwelling east of the Guandong Gate. His neighbors grew familiar with him, noting his diligence, cleanliness, humility, and composure—never had they seen him display joy or anger. One day, a neighbor who owed a debt was pressed by his creditor, who filed a lawsuit. The authorities were about to arrest him. With no way out, the debtor planned to flee to a distant town. Otherwise, he would be imprisoned, leaving his family of several with nothing to eat, surely leading to their ruin. His clan gathered, weeping as they prepared to part. The oil merchant asked the reason and, after hearing it, fell silent for a long time. Then he said, \"There is no need to flee. I have a plan.\"\n\nThe oil merchant immediately purchased a clay crucible and five catties of charcoal, which he brought to the debtor’s home. There, he dug a pit to serve as a furnace, placed the medicine inside the crucible, and sealed it with mud. Then he lit the charcoal and burned it. He instructed, \"Wait until I return before opening it. Do not treat this lightly.\" He also taught them how to tend the fire, then shouldered his load and left. That evening, he did not return. Nor did he appear the next morning or by noon. When the fire had burned itself out, the family opened the crucible and found it filled with pure gold. They sold it to repay the debt—over three hundred thousand cash—and from that day on, the oil merchant vanished without a trace.\n\n**Scholar Wang Lin**\nScholar Wang Lin, a *jinshi* of the *jimao* year of the Dazhong era, was returning to the capital after traveling to the frontier. Upon his arrival, the late Emperor Xuān had just passed away, and the people were in turmoil. As he entered through the Jin’guang Gate, he sought lodging at the inns, but all were full. He then went to Jingyun Abbey in Fengyi Ward, where a solitary courtyard was available for a monthly rent of five hundred *wen*. He stabled his horse and settled in.\n\nNearby lived an old man with thick brows and a broad forehead, his beard and temples snowy white. His face bore an ancient yet refined air. One day, he entered carrying a basket and, upon seeing Wang Lin, exclaimed in surprise, \"Someone is already living here—I must move again.\" Wang Lin bowed and said, \"Since you arrived first, please stay without worry. I will only be here for two or three days, while you have occupied this room for over twenty.\" The old man replied, \"I have heard of this place before, but it is difficult to lodge here for long, even for a gentleman paying monthly rent.\" Wang Lin insisted he stay, and the old man agreed, ascending the steps with evident pleasure. He opened the door, drew water, and entered, then shut the gate and remained silent.\n\nIt was the eighth month. The old man had already kindled a charcoal fire in a ground stove and sat wrapped in its warmth. He stayed awake deep into the night, doing so every evening, yet there was no sign of a kitchen or cooking fire. Wang Lin asked what he was doing, and the old man replied, \"I am old and make my living selling needles. I often visit the markets and no longer bother with cooking fires.\" After more than ten days, Wang Lin suspected the old man possessed the Dao and began to treat him with reverence and intimacy. Sometimes he would sit by the stove and converse with him. The old man’s words were lofty and profound, far beyond those of ordinary men. Gradually, Wang Lin confided his feelings and sought to learn from him. But when dawn came, the old man departed and did not return by evening. Wang Lin opened the door to find the stove gone, only a broken alchemical cauldron remaining, its interior faintly gleaming with a golden hue.\n\n**The Monk of Niutou Temple in Zizhou**\n\nThe abbot of Mount Zhongshan had begun constructing a sutra tower, planning four stories. No sooner had the first level been completed than a million in funds had already been expended. As the project stalled, no progress was made, and the abbot’s sighs of distress and anxiety showed plainly in his words and expression.\n\nAmong the kitchen workers was a monk of humble and rustic bearing, ordinarily tasked with nothing more than gathering firewood and drawing water. No one knew his origins. One day, he suddenly approached the abbot and said, “This matter is beyond your understanding. Leave it be and do not inquire further.” Several days later, he spoke again, only to be rebuffed as before. This happened three times in all. The abbot, suspecting something unusual, gently asked his intent.\n\nThe monk replied, “This humble monk possesses a method of transmutation. I wish to help the master complete this great work.” When asked what he required, he said, “Only twenty thousand cash to procure the necessary ingredients—enough to accomplish the task.” Though the abbot found his words strange and suspected deceit, he nonetheless sent someone to provide the money for the purchase.\n\nThe monk immediately dispatched another monk to buy the materials. They obtained twenty *jin* of mercury, and with the remaining funds, purchased various minerals and herbs, returning by evening. In a small room beside the kitchen, he dug a furnace in the earth, sealing it meticulously. He spread three *sheng* of ash beneath it, poured the mercury into the ash, and took a small measure of powdered medicine from his sash, sprinkling it into the mixture. Covering it with an oil-paper sheet, he piled over a hundred *jin* of charcoal atop it and kindled a fierce fire to refine it.\n\nFrom night until dawn, the fire burned away, leaving behind a massive cake of pure gold, its luster extraordinary. The monk said, “Take this to the market and sell it to merchants at twenty strings of cash per *liang*.” Following his instructions, the abbot sold the gold, purchased materials, and hired workers—whereupon the tower was swiftly completed.\n\nOne day, the monk departed, and the abbot of the tower dispersed his disciples to search for him. After more than a month, they encountered him in the market of Jiazhou and earnestly entreated him to return with them to Zizhou, but he firmly refused. The pursuing monks then quarreled with him, and they were seized by the patrol officers for interrogation. Upon questioning, they fully revealed that this monk possessed the art of transmuting base metals into gold. The abbot of Zizhou sent men to search for him and bring him back to his former lodging. The alchemist was detained by the authorities, who sought to coax and question him, desiring to learn his craft. He kept his mouth sealed and would not respond, so they secretly murdered him and cast his body into the river.\n\n**Ren Gongjin**\nRen Gongjin was a native of Huaiyuan Lane in Chang’an, a boy of over ten years. A recluse named Zhao, of unknown origin, lodged in his neighborhood. Living alone, he would depart at dawn and return at dusk, yet there was no sign of a kitchen or hearth in his dwelling. Ren’s father had observed him for several years and one day said to him, “Master, each time you go out, you carry your own umbrella—is it not wearisome? I have a son of over ten years who would gladly hold your umbrella, boil tea, and attend to your needs. Would that be acceptable?” Zhao happily agreed. Ren served him for another seven or eight years, reverent, diligent, and composed, and Zhao grew quite fond of him.\n\nOne day, Zhao suddenly fixed his gaze upon Ren’s face and said in alarm, “Your spirit and form have changed—you are destined for execution in the marketplace. You should not remain here any longer. You have often seen the workings of the furnace and crucible—can you remember them?” Ren replied, “I have not received your instruction, Master, and dare not secretly commit them to memory.” Zhao then took out his medicines and minerals, showing them to Ren one by one, teaching him orally and demonstrating with his hands how to transmute tin into silver. He warned him, “Do not wear silk or brocade, do not indulge in extravagance, do not glut yourself on wine and meat, do not indulge in lust, do not ride in silver-trimmed carriages, do not seek official rank or fame. Your clothing and food have always been plain and meager, your fate lowly and humble. I provide only enough to sustain you. You must serve as a bondsman for twenty years, cultivating frugality and diligence, content with toil. The slightest lapse in restraint will surely bring you to execution. Be warned, be cautious.” Soon after, Zhao took leave of Ren’s family and arranged for him to serve as a bondsman under the younger brother of Officer Duan, where he remained for ten years. His conduct and integrity surpassed that of ordinary servants. Before long, Duan’s brother departed for the capital and, trusting in Ren’s honesty and prudence, left him in charge of the household. Later, when Ren transmuted silver and spent beyond his means, the master and his concubine berated him relentlessly. Unable to endure their abuse, he seized a knife and killed them. Arrested and interrogated under torture, he was to be sentenced to the harshest penalty. When the magistrate inquired into the full account of the matter, Ren recounted all that had transpired. Testing his transmutation of tin, they found it to be true. Ren wept and said, “I violated the Master’s warnings and ensnared myself in the net of punishment. Had I endured for twenty years, I would have escaped this calamity.” In the end, he was executed.\n\nThe arts of alchemy—whether transmuting base metals into gold or silver—are not to be recklessly pursued by ordinary men. Those who obtain such knowledge often invite disaster, as verified by countless examples from ancient times to the present. Those who aspire to the Dao should take heed.\n\n**The Girl of Qiyang**\nThere was a girl from Qiyang, five or six years of age, whose family sold wine. One day, in the depths of winter’s bitter cold, a dozen woodcutters gathered firewood in the market before gradually dispersing. Only an old man remained, his load of firewood unsold as dusk approached, the north wind growing fiercer. The girl’s mother, moved by pity, called to him and bought his firewood for a hundred coins, offering him a meal. The old man said, “No need for food.” He handed her a vessel of wine, and from his sleeve a persimmon fell. The girl picked it up. The old man smiled and said, “I had meant to take it home, but since you, child, have found it, you may eat it.” The girl then gazed at the persimmon and, from that moment, ate nothing else. Several years passed, and her appearance became extraordinarily lovely. As for the woodcutter, none knew where he had gone.\n\n*Record of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Four—End*\n\n**Record of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Five**\n*Compiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*\n\n---\n\n1. *作尉* (\"served as commandant\")—*The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* reads *假尉* (\"served as acting commandant\").\n2. *有* (\"had\")—*The Seven Bamboo Tablets* reads *友* (\"befriended\").\n3.

At dawn, Cui saw him again and showed a look of pity. He bowed and asked the old man’s name; the latter removed his bamboo hat to speak, and Cui, observing his unusual appearance, inquired after his surname and given name. The old man replied, “I am surnamed Ge, the third.” Cui invited him to sit. Cui said, “The snow is bitterly cold—might I offer you a bowl of barley noodles?” The old man replied, “Barley is full of qi in all seasons; eating it benefits one. Do not add fermented beans, for they harm the central viscera.” Cui agreed and promptly ordered the meal prepared.\n\nAt the time, Cui had stretched silk for a painter to create a picture, but the painter had not yet arrived due to the freezing cold. The silk hung against the wall, and the old man took up brush and ink from the table, drawing a withered pine, a Daoist gathering herbs, and a deer following behind. His strokes were swift and free, the style lofty and ancient—far beyond what the mortal world could produce. After eating, he expressed his thanks and departed. Cui, astonished by the event, treasured the painting and carried it with him. Later, while traveling in the Huai-Hai region, he encountered a connoisseur of ancient paintings and showed it to him. The connoisseur said, “This is a painting by Ge Sanlang, son of Ge Zhichuan.”\n\nIn the early years of Xiantong, Cui entered Chang’an and at Ba Bridge encountered a vegetarian mendicant whose appearance resembled the old man’s. He asked, “Are you not Ge Sanlang?” The mendicant smiled and said, “No. Ge Sanlang was the son of Ge Zhichuan of the Jin dynasty—how could people today recognize him?” He then shouldered his yoke and departed, vanishing without a trace. The monk Huaiyi of Yue.\n\nThe monk Huaiyi of Yue resided at Cloud Gate Temple. During the Xiantong era, as he prepared to ascend the hall at dawn to light incense, he suddenly saw a Daoist who turned to him and said, “There is a wondrous realm—would you care to visit?” Huaiyi agreed, and together they entered the mountains. Flowers and trees flourished in lush abundance; waters and rocks held serene beauty. At times, towering peaks touched the heavens, with ancient pines lining the path; at others, jade towers blotted out the sun, and tiered cities clung to the void. The marvels he beheld defied description. After some time, he grew hungry, and the Daoist already knew. He said, “Here grows a celestial peach, bearing fruit but once in a thousand years—it will cure your hunger.” He handed Huaiyi a peach, large as a two-*sheng* vessel, its fragrance and flavor unmatched in the mortal world. After eating, they continued their journey. At times, he walked upon water without wetting his feet; at others, he soared through the air without obstruction. Now he stood atop the clouds, now he waved his sleeves in the empty sky; now he gazed down at the sun and moon, now he peered below at the Milky Way. Thus they returned to the human realm after a full year had passed. From that time on, Huaiyi ate no more. He wandered among men, spoke of his experience to his parents, and thereafter entered the Dao. He sought out immortals, explored sacred marvels, and departed, never to return.\n\nDu Huai, in his youth, encountered a Daoist on Mount Changbai. The Daoist, seeing his many ailments, gave him a grain of cinnabar, large as a *zuan* bean, its red light radiant and translucent, and bade him swallow it. “This elixir not only dispels cold accumulations,” he said, “but if you abstain from meat, it may grant you long life. Beware of defilement.” After taking the pill, Du’s complexion grew full and joyful, his body light and vigorous, and he no longer needed to eat. He rose through the ranks to become Prefect of Shangzhou. For thirty years, he abstained from grain, a fact unknown to others. He said, “My immortal master warned me against eating meat. Now, wishing to cease all grain, I must first eat meat—but that will surely rob me of the elixir’s power.” So he ate a small portion of meat. After a long while, he vomited an object the size of a chicken’s egg, soft and sticky like fresh glue. Cutting it open, he found the cinnabar within, its light and color as bright as when he first took it. He tried to swallow it again, but it slipped away. He lamented the loss for a long time. That night, he dreamed of the Daoist from Mount Changbai, who said, “You failed to keep my precept and forfeited long life. I have reclaimed the elixir.” At the time, Du was over eighty years old, yet appeared no older than forty. After losing the elixir, within ten days his teeth and hair aged, his complexion withered, and within a few years, he died.\n\nWu Dan Cu\n\nWu Dan Cu was a native of Pingyuan Township in Fengtian, Jingzhao. During the Xiantong era, as drought and famine struck the capital region, he took his wife and two children westward to seek sustenance. Arriving in Yongshou County, he joined an old man to reap wheat. The old man led him deep into the western mountains, journeying over ten *li*. Suddenly, a violent thunderstorm erupted. Once the skies cleared, they gradually approached the old man’s estate. Its gates and courtyards were solemn and immaculate, resembling an official residence.\n\nThe old man prepared a meal for Wu and slowly explained, “I am surnamed Han. I cultivate the Dao here. Generally, in Daoist practice, if one owes even the slightest debt to another, one cannot ascend to heaven. I once borrowed money from you—a sum of five hundred thousand coins—and had not yet repaid it before your distant journey. Now, I wish to settle this debt.”\n\nAfter the meal, the old man sent a village boy to guide Wu out of the mountain gate, instructing him, “You may await me in Jingzhou. As for the debt in Yongshou, I shall first provide five hundred thousand coins for your travel provisions.”\n\nUpon parting, after walking a hundred paces, Wu emerged from what seemed like a mist and found himself back in Yongshou’s marketplace. He then traveled to Jingzhou and took up residence there. That night, he dreamed of Master Han, who said, “The money lies beneath your bed. You may take and use it.” The next day, he found five hundred thousand coins under his bed. From then on, his enterprises prospered, and his resources became abundant.\n\nThough his fellow villagers later learned of a Daoist cultivator named Han in the mountains, they could not recall his given name. When they returned to search for the estate, they could no longer find its location.\n\n---\n\nWang Kuo\n\nThe commoner Wang Kuo, during the Xiantong era, boarded a boat at Kezhu to cross Dongting Lake. A fierce wind arose, forcing the vessel to moor at the foot of Jun Mountain. Wang and several companions disembarked to explore the mountain paths. As they ascended, they suddenly caught the scent of wine. When Wang asked his companions, none detected it. The fragrance grew stronger, and soon they spotted a cave in the mountainside. Suspicious, Wang entered the cavern. After ten paces, he found a depression in the flat stone, filled with wine. He scooped some and drank—its flavor was rich and exquisite. After consuming half a *dou* or more, he grew pleasantly intoxicated. Resting beside the depression, he dozed until he partially sobered, then returned to the boat.\n\nWhen he recounted the tale to his fellow travelers, they rushed to seek the cave but found nothing. From that day, Wang felt invigorated and free of illness. Gradually, he lost his taste for grains and entered the famous mountains to study the Dao. Later, he came across a scripture stating, “On Jun Mountain lies celestial wine; those who drink it ascend as immortals.” The wine Wang encountered was indeed this divine brew.\n\n---\n\nDuke Gao Pian of Yan\n\nThe Chancellor, Duke Gao Pian of Yan...\n\nIn the third year of Qianfu, the bing-shen year (876), during the eighth month, Duke Gao Pian of Yan began constructing the outer city walls and fortified gates to repel enemies, spanning thirty-two *li*. Starting from the northwest, he excavated the earth to channel the waters of the Qingyuan River southeastward, where it converged with the Qingcheng River. He then dug a moat along the southwest, extending from south of the Xian Gate to the front of the Ganting Temple, where it met the great river, encircling the city for defense. For the rammed-earth construction, he mobilized labor from the counties of Peng, Mei, Jia, Shu, Zi, Jian, Na, Han, Huan, and the capital’s outskirts—ten counties in all—assigning workers to measure and set the frames. The project was completed in sixty days.\n\nMagistrate Chen Zhao of Linnan County oversaw the efforts of seven counties, which were allocated sections including Jinhua Street and the former site of Sima Xiangru’s Qin Terrace. In total, seven terraces were built, each over a *zhang* in height, with the central terrace being the largest. The earth was entirely excavated from these sites, and beneath them, a new moat was dredged, over twenty *chi* deep. At its base lay stone slabs, three to four *chi* wide, five to six *chi* long, and over a *chi* thick, stacked in pairs for sturdy reinforcement. As the laborers lifted the stones, a five-colored smoke and flame suddenly rose three *chi* high from the pit. Within the stone cavity, they discovered a square stone box, over five *cun* in size, its surface gleaming with golden radiance as if freshly painted. Inside the box lay a silver gourd, the size of a finger. The workers scrambled to seize it, fighting and grappling, and though Chen Zhao attempted to restrain them, he could not. He reported the incident to Duke Gao.\n\nDuke Gao dispatched Hou Qian, the supervisor of the western sector’s construction, to investigate. They retrieved the gourd, the stone box, and a single grain of golden elixir. It was said there had been seven grains, but six were lost in the scuffle. The duke placed the gourd in his oratory, offering incense and reverence. The next morning, seven grains of cinnabar, vividly red and extraordinary, appeared. The duke consumed them all. He then ordered the release of all workers involved in the brawl, theft, or loss of the elixir, asking no further questions.\n\n**Prefect Yang**\nPrefect Yang was a eunuch whose given name is lost. At eighteen, he was seized by officials of the underworld and died without illness. After a night, he revived, recounting that upon arriving in the netherworld, he found its bureaucracy and records no different from the mortal realm. The underworld officials showed him a register where his name appeared clearly, noting his lifespan as eighteen years, though no one made any requests of him. A bystander pleaded fervently for his revival, and after some time, the officials granted permission. The man escorted Yang for several hundred paces before parting. Overcome with gratitude for his second life, Yang asked how he might repay him. The man replied, “If you could offer a *mingsha* bow, that would suffice.” He then gave Yang over a hundred large copper coins.\n\nAwakening suddenly, Yang suffered no discomfort. Thereafter, he sought the *mingsha* bow but could not obtain one. Instead, he crafted small models of palace halls, burned them as offerings, and consumed the ashes—this he did several times. Yang devoted himself to alchemy, his heart set on elixirs and minerals, and mastered the art of refining the *fanhun* elixir. When a local lord suddenly died, Yang ground a grain of the elixir, pried open the man’s mouth, and poured it in, reviving him instantly. He saved several lives in this manner.\n\nThere was a palace official named Xiahou who received five grains of the elixir from Yang. Later, when the underworld officials came to claim him, Xiahou explained during the interrogation that he had consumed one grain of Yang’s elixir. The officials immediately sent him back. Upon reviving, Xiahou consumed the remaining four grains. Over a year later, yellow-robed figures came to seize him, clarifying they were not from the underworld but from Mount Tai. Xiahou followed them to the foot of a great mountain, where he saw palatial halls. At the gate, two Daoist priests questioned his past deeds, to which he answered in detail. Then he added, “I have consumed five grains of Prefect Yang’s elixir.” The priests promptly ordered him to return. Xiahou bowed in thanks, saying, “By the power of this divine elixir, I have prolonged my life. May I change my name to *Yannian* (Prolonged Years)?” The priests consented, and thereafter he was known as Xiahou Yannian.\n\nYang, recognizing the miraculous efficacy of his elixir, often used it to save others. His son, Xuan, was returning to the capital from the outskirts when, before dawn, he had traveled over twenty *li* and rested at a large estate. Suddenly, he heard cries of alarm and weeping from within. Upon inquiry, he learned that the host’s son had died suddenly. Xuan took a grain of elixir from his sash, ground it, and poured it into the boy’s mouth, reviving him after some time.\n\nYang was wealthy and retired early, living freely and devoting himself solely to alchemy. He never fell ill and lived to ninety-seven. In his later years, he encountered a man carrying a bow, which he learned was a *mingsha* bow. Within its horn and wood, sand shifted as it moved. Yang purchased it, burned it as an offering, and thus repaid his savior. The formula for the *fanhun* elixir, he claimed, had been taught to him by his rescuer, and he refined it in secret, so none could replicate his art.\n\n**Xue Feng**\nXue Feng of Hedong served as prefect of Sizhou during the Xiantong era (860–874).\n\nA year later, he dreamed of entering a grotto palace, where an abundance of prepared delicacies lay before him. Yet he saw no one, nor dared to eat, so he departed through the mountain gate. Someone said to him, \"This is the Celestial Granary.\"\n\nWhen he recounted this to his guests and friends, one remarked, \"Within the borders of your prefecture, in Changming County, there is a Celestial Granary. Inside its cavern are naturally occurring foods and drinks, which wandering mendicants often find and consume.\" He immediately dispatched the Daoist Sun Lingfeng, along with trusted officials, to investigate.\n\nThey entered the cave and traveled some ten *li*, still requiring torches. Beyond ten *li*, the darkness gradually gave way to brightness. After another three to five *li*, the scene suddenly became indistinguishable from the mortal world. The cavern chambers were vast, capable of holding a thousand people. Below, the ground was level, lined with stone beds upon which lay an array of foods and delicacies, all appearing freshly prepared—soft, sweet, and fragrant. Lingfeng bowed, partook of the meal, and cut open three or five portions to present to Prefect Xue as proof. Yet upon carrying them out of the cave, their forms remained intact but had all turned to stone.\n\nWithin the cave, scattered about were heaps of *mian* and *sou*, piles of salted beans, and mounds of fermented black beans, their quantity beyond measure. Proceeding another one or two *li*, they encountered a swift and surging stream, both wide and deep. Across the water, mountains and rivers stretched out, with dwellings clearly visible, but they dared not cross and turned back. Near the cliffside slope, they observed footprints coming and going, each two to three *chi* in length, as if left by some unseen travelers.\n\nUpon hearing this, Xue marveled at the wondrous and numinous sight, though he could not fathom its cause. I have consulted the *Treatise on Geography*, which states: \"On Mount Shaoshi grow natural grains, sweet fruits, divine mushrooms, and immortal herbs. When Prince Jin of Zhou learned the Dao and ascended as an immortal, he left behind nine thousand years’ worth of provisions on the mountain.\" Mount Shaoshi lies seventeen *li* west of Mount Song. From its eastern ridge, one ascends forty *li* to reach the lower terrace, then another ten *li* to the upper terrace, *Dingsi*. Midway, at twenty *li*, stands a great stone gate, marking the middle terrace. Beyond the middle terrace, descending to the cliff’s edge, one finds a stone chamber containing water and abundant white quartz. Within the chamber are naturally occurring scriptures and sustenance—no different from what was described here.\n\nMoreover, on the eastern side of Mount Tiantai, there is a cave. After entering some ten *li*, one encounters inhabitants and market stalls selling food and drink. During the Qianfu era (874–879), a wandering monk entered the cave and passed through the market, ravenous. Drawn by the aroma, he bought a steamed bun and ate it. His companion, a monk who subsisted on *qi* and had eaten nothing, remained sated. After traveling another ten *li*, they exited the cave, only to find themselves in Muping County, Dengzhou. The monk who had eaten the bun suddenly transformed into stone.\n\nFrom this, we may infer that those who partook of Wang Lie’s stone marrow or Zhang Hua’s dragon fat must have accumulated profound merit and possessed heaven-endowed immortal bones before ascending to the ranks of immortality. If an ordinary person were to consume such things, they would surely turn to stone. The people of Shu...\n\nThe people of Shu, during the years of famine under the Jin dynasty, would band together in groups of three to five, carrying wooden bows and bamboo arrows into White Deer Mountain to hunt for sustenance. Once, as they startled a herd of deer into flight, they split up to pursue them. One man saw a deer dart between two cliffs—barely wide enough for a person to pass—and followed it. After ten-odd steps, he found himself amidst a bustling city with rows of shops and the clamor of wells, the deer nowhere in sight. Wandering through the market, he asked a passerby, \"Where is this place?\" The reply came: \"This is but a lesser Chengdu. It is no place for ordinary folk like you; you should not linger.\" He then exited through a stone cavern, secretly marking the path home, and reported the matter to Prefect Liu Jun. The prefect hastily sent men to follow, but the original site was lost.\n\nYu Zhongchong’s *Tales of Yong and Jing* states: \"Several *li* south of Xiyang County in Wuling, there stands a solitary mountain. Its cliffs are sheer and towering, and atop them grow scallions in neat, self-formed rows. Those who bow and beg for them find the scallions uprooting themselves, and their taste is exquisite. On the mountain’s summit lies a pool filled with fish and turtles, which all emerge to swim on the seventh day of the seventh month. Halfway up the cliff, within a grotto, are thousands of scrolls—scriptures left behind by an ancient Daoist. During the Yuanjia era (424–453), a tribesman from the southern hills came to this mountain to hunt deer. Pursuing one into a stone cavern, he found a ladder beside the entrance and climbed it. Suddenly, the ladder opened into a vast expanse, revealing another sky and sun. After several dozen steps, he beheld lush mulberry groves and fruit trees, with fields and paths laid out in perfect order. Many people were going about their way. Startled, the tribesman fled, hastily carving marks into trees to record the path. Later, he returned with companions to search, but the place was nowhere to be found.\"\n\nGu Yewang remarked: \"Within heaven and earth, amid the famous mountains, there are grottoes and abodes of divine marvels—not just one or two. The Peach Blossom Spring and Tiantai’s caves are of this kind.\"\n\nKang Zhihuai\nKang Zhihuai was the son of Kang Hechi, a musician of the Imperial Music Bureau. From childhood, he was exceptional, drawn to antiquity and virtue, and harbored a longing for the freedom of clouds and springs. Witty and quick-witted, he often journeyed from Ziwu Valley to Jinzhou, returning only after half a year. Whenever he encountered secluded waters or striking rocks, he would linger to admire their beauty.\n\nSuddenly, as he traveled through the valley, he heard the sounds of thunder, wind, and rain near the mountainside. Soon after, the clouds dispersed and the sky cleared, but the mountain streams had swelled and overflowed. Upon the water appeared an old man, gliding toward him on a raft. Addressing Kang along the shore, he said: \"You bear the qi of the Dao and are destined for attainment. Yet in the coming decade, the Four Seas will boil, the Nine Provinces will split asunder, the royal house will face many calamities, and strife will not soon be quelled. You must dwell in seclusion, far from harm, and avoid proximity to kings, dukes, and high ministers to preserve your primal fortune. I possess the *Nine Palaces of Ghost Valley* scripture and now bestow it upon you. Study its auspicious directions well, and use it to plot your refuge.\"\n\nWith that, the old man drifted away, the waters swiftly receded, and the mountain path reopened. Kang received the book and followed its teachings, divining the past and foreseeing the future, assessing fortune and misfortune—even the famed Jing Fang and Guan Lu could not surpass him. The old man had instructed him to take shelter in Daokang, so he donned a scholar’s cap and settled in the southern pavilion of Xima, west of the Kaiyuan Temple in Yongle Ward. Scholars and officials flocked to him for counsel, their requests unceasing. He had intended to select a dwelling on Mount Zhongtiao but had not yet prepared his plans.\n\nHan Wen, the Left Army Commander-in-Chief, sent envoys three times to summon him. Reluctantly, Kang paid his respects. Upon arrival, he was appointed to a military post with the rank of censor, presented with a golden fish-shaped tally, a jade belt, robes, horses, and boots—all bestowed upon him. Kang donned the official regalia, bowed in gratitude in the courtyard, and returned home. To his son, he said: \"Such coercion leaves me no choice but to depart.\" The next morning, he passed without illness. Days later, his flesh remained fragrant and unblemished, leading people to believe he had undergone *shijie*—liberation through apparent death.\n\nSince then, amid the weapons and armor of the Central Plains and the martial conflicts across the land, all turned to the old man’s words for guidance. The text he bestowed was titled *The Precious Chapters of the Pivot of Fate*.\n\nThe monk Wu Xuan was of unknown origin. Though he dwelt in the garb of a monk, his heart was set on seeking the Dao. From the Three Rivers and Five Ridges to the famous mountains of Qian and Chu, there was nowhere he did not travel. Wherever he encountered a grotto-heaven, he would invariably visit it.\n\nUpon entering Mount Emei, he heard there were seventy-two caves. Beyond the Thunder Cave, among the cliffs, stone chambers, and deep caverns, none remained unvisited. One day, he rested beneath a great tree. After some time, an old man appeared, ascending from below. They exchanged bows and sat together.\n\nThe old man asked where he was bound, and Wu Xuan recounted his quest to visit famous mountains and sacred grottoes. The old man said: \"Famous mountains and great rivers all have grottoes, but without knowing their names, one cannot casually enter to explore. One must obtain *The Record of Dongting* and *The Scripture of the Sacred Peaks*, examine their affiliations, determine their names, and verify their locations. Only when these match the records of immortals’ dwellings may one venture forth. Otherwise, there are Wind-and-Thunder Caves, Ghost-and-Spirit Caves, Hell Caves, and Dragon-and-Serpent Caves—mistaken entry may cost one’s life, turning a quest for benefit into harm. This is deeply to be guarded against.\"\n\nWu Xuan was startled for a long while before thanking the old man for his instruction. He then asked: \"As for the grotto-heavens of Mount Emei, may one safely visit them?\" The old man replied: \"I dare not speak much of the affairs of immortals, but if you pay respects to the master of the cave, you may inquire of him yourself.\"\n\nWu Xuan asked further who the cave master was. The old man said: \"The cave master’s surname is Zhang. He is now at the market gate of Jiazhou, where he works as a butcher. He is the middle-aged, stout man there.\" With that, he took his leave.\n\nWu Xuan returned to the market gate and found Zhang there.\n\nWu Xuan recounted the previous events to Zhang, who said: \"Say no more.\" He then instructed his wife to cook meat and offered it to Wu Xuan as a meal, presenting three dishes of it. Wu Xuan declined, saying he had not eaten meat for a long time. Zhang replied: \"To travel the mountains, one must have strength and avoid exhaustion—only then can you proceed. If you refuse this, you will never reach your destination.\" He urged Wu Xuan repeatedly, who then pondered to himself, fearing this might be a test by an immortal, and dared not disobey. He consumed two dishes, his hunger and thirst growing ever more intense, while Zhang continued to press him, though he could eat no more. After finishing, Wu Xuan asked to leave. Zhang stooped to pick up a piece of tile and handed it to him, saying: \"When you enter the mountains and reach such-and-such a peak, you will find the gate of such-and-such a cave. There stands a tall pine, below it a cave stream, above it sheer cliffs—this is the grotto where the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign dwells. Strike the gate with this tile, twenty or thirty times, and the door will open. At each gate you encounter, knock thus, and you will reach the realm of the immortals.\" Following his instructions, Wu Xuan entered the mountains and indeed found the cave, just as described. He struck the gate with the tile, and after a long while, the sheer cliff parted, revealing a vast and level cavern within, wide enough for carriages and horses. On either side, smooth green stone gleamed, with hanging springs and flowing channels flanking the path. After traveling more than ten *li*, he came to another gate. Knocking, it opened again, revealing an even vaster and more expansive space. Along the way, celestial blossoms lined the path, and the rare flowers and extraordinary sights he glimpsed—along with the throngs of figures passing by, mostly fair maidens and lovely women, jade lads and immortal maidens, and at times, immortal officials and Daoist masters with their retinues of carriages and attendants—filled the scene without end. He reached yet another gate and knocked with even greater urgency, but the tile shattered completely, and the door remained shut. After a long while, he heard a sound like thunder, as if the mountain were collapsing, and in terror, he fled outward. After running thirty or fifty paces, he found himself outside the cave entrance, with none of the earlier scenery remaining. When he sought the cave master again, more than a month had passed. The butcher’s stall was still there, but Zhang had already been dead for over ten days. From then on, Wu Xuan was determined to visit famous mountains, vowing to seek transcendence. Later, he entered Mount Emei and was never heard from again.\n\nFei Guanqing\nFei Guanqing was a native of Chizhou. After passing the imperial examinations, he prepared to return to his hometown and bid farewell to Chancellor Zheng Yuqing. The Chancellor had long been on good terms with Liu Ling, the magistrate of Qiupu, and was pleased by Fei’s journey. He entrusted Fei with a letter to deliver. The handwritten letter filled a sheet, which Zheng sealed and handed to Fei, cautioning him: \"Magistrate Liu has long been in official circles. The reason he has not advanced in the rankings is his impetuous and unconstrained nature, which does not conform to the times. Though he has set aside high office for this post, you should treat him well.\" Fei then asked the Chancellor to add a few words of recommendation at the end of the letter, hoping to secure a favorable reception. Zheng agreed, opened the letter, wrote several lines, and resealed it as before. Fei arrived in Qiupu and first presented his calling card to Liu. Liu glanced at it, tossed it onto his desk, and paid no further attention. Fei stood nervously awaiting instructions, but after a long while, no response came. Suspecting Liu’s displeasure, he handed the Chancellor’s letter to the attendant. Liu broke the seal, read it, and scoffed: \"What use is this letter from that old man Zheng?\" He crumpled it and cast it aside. Fei grew even more fearful and, pushing open the door, entered and hurried forward to bow before him. Liu suddenly turned and looked at him with pity, then gestured for him to sit and spoke with him. As dusk fell, Liu urged him to find an inn, but Fei said: \"The day has grown dark, and I may not reach a lodging in time. I beg to spend the night here, even if only on the floor of the hall. Tomorrow, I will go to an inn.\" He then opened his luggage and spread out a felt mat on the ground. Liu brushed off his robes and entered, emerging after a long while to say: \"This is no place to receive guests. There is a small chamber where you may rest. Your servants can stay outside.\" He then ordered his attendants to lead Fei’s servants and guards to separate quarters. Liu led Fei, carrying his mat, into a small chamber behind the hall. The door was then shut, the lock fastened tightly, leaving Fei bewildered. He sat on the bed to rest.\n\nThat night, the moon shone brightly. Peering through the crack in the door, he saw no sound or movement outside. Then he observed Magistrate Liu personally taking up a broom and dustpan, sweeping the hall inside and out, the courtyard, steps, and walls—nothing was left untouched. Astonished, Fei sat upright, holding his breath, watching without sleep. As the second watch approached, a strange fragrance, unlike anything in the mortal world, filled the air. After a long while, Liu stood holding a tablet, bowing reverently in the courtyard as if awaiting someone. The fragrance grew stronger, and suddenly, a celestial figure in a cloud crown and purple robes, eight or nine *chi* tall, arrived with dozens of attendants. Liu prostrated himself in obeisance. The immortal strode directly into the hall, with Liu standing by his side. Soon, a banquet was laid out, with rare delicacies and exotic fruits in fragrant containers. Fei, though unseen, felt his spirit clear and his breath ease. Before long, music played and wine was poured. Liu was ordered to spread a mat on the ground and attend the feast. The melodies were unlike any earthly tunes. The immortal suddenly asked: \"Have you received news from Zheng?\" Liu replied: \"I have. He is well.\" After a moment, the immortal asked again: \"Did you receive Zheng’s letter?\" Liu answered: \"Fei Guanqing, a recent graduate, came from Chang’an and brought it.\" The immortal smiled and said: \"Fei Guanqing is fortunate to have passed the examinations. Is he here now?\" Liu replied: \"He is.\"\n\nThe immortal said: \"I ought not yet meet with him. First, give him a cup of wine, and tell him only that if he cultivates the Dao early, he may then meet with me.\" Thereupon, he ordered Liu to pour a cup of wine and place it in a lidded box. Fei watched as Liu drank the wine himself, then dropped the cup into a basin of water beneath the steps. Fei hesitated, leaving the wine untouched. Suddenly, the immortal descended the steps, and with his disciples, ascended upon the clouds and departed. Liu bowed in farewell, weeping. The immortal admonished him: \"When you see Zheng, tell him only to cultivate the Dao, and he may then meet with me.\" After they had gone, Liu immediately went to the box and found the wine still there. Astonished, he exclaimed: \"This wine is a once-in-ten-thousand-kalpas encounter—why did you not drink it?\" Fei struggled to take one or two sips, and Liu then became his companion in Daoist cultivation. They chose to reside on Mount Jiuhua, and though summoned to court as *Zuoshiyi*, he never accepted the post. Soon after, Chancellor Zheng passed away. Liu and Fei kept the matter secret, never knowing which immortal it was who had descended.\n\n**Ziluo Elder Ren**\nWhen Zheng Nanhai served as governor of Liang and Song, his cousin, the scholar Liu, was residing in Ruzhou. The state had a Ziluo Mountain, a realm of divine immortals. Liu, pressed by poverty in his lodgings, intended to travel to Liang and Song to seek aid. Passing by an apothecary’s shop, he sat down, and an old woodcutter leaned against the wall, also taking a seat. The shopkeeper repeatedly scolded him, saying: \"This is an official’s guest—why do you barge in so rudely!\" Liu straightened his robes and rose, saying to the shopkeeper: \"I am but an idle man. This woodcutter has come for a reason—perhaps he seeks medicine or has an urgent request. Do not send him away.\" He earnestly invited the elder to sit and asked what he needed. The elder said: \"I only ask for a sheet of paper and brush and ink.\" Liu immediately took paper and brush from the shop and gave them to him. The elder wielded the brush with ease, wrote swiftly, and handed the paper to Liu. It read:\n\n*Since you wish to go to Liang and Song,*\n*Know that calamity weighs heavy there.*\n*Day and night, you’ll face false accusations.*\n*Since you wish to visit Zheng,*\n*Zheng will soon meet with misfortune,*\n*Becoming a wanderer a thousand li away,*\n*And changing even the color of his robes.*\n*—Written by Ren, the woodcutter of Ziluo Mountain.*\n\nLiu read it with astonishment—the brushwork was bold and transcendent, surpassing the ordinary. As he read, the elder vanished. A month later, Zheng was falsely accused, stripped of his office, and exiled a thousand *li* away, all as foretold. Liu then built a dwelling on Ziluo Mountain and sought the elder everywhere, but never saw him again. The world treasured his writing, though when bandits raided the capital, it was lost.\n\n**Zhu Hanzhen**\nZhu Hanzhen was a Daoist from Jinling.\n\nZhu Hanzhen dwelled in the eastern chamber of Longxing Abbey, ever devoted to tending the incense and lamps with unwavering diligence, never once slackening despite his poverty. In the *bingzi* year of the Dazhong era, the Daoist Ma Ziran, a wandering figure in Jiang-Zhe, made merry with wine and leisure his sole pursuit. Yet many marveled at him, suspecting he was one who had attained the Dao. Whenever he visited Hanzhen, he would insist on staying, and Hanzhen always did his utmost to host him. After more than a year, Ma said to Hanzhen: \"I have long wandered Jiang-Zhe, but now I shall journey north. The sacred peaks of Song and Luo, the divine precincts of Hua—these are the abodes of immortals, where one feasts on harmony and savors the Dao. A Daoist cannot but visit them. You possess the will to cultivate, yet lack the means for offerings; you have a heart to pity the world, yet no power to save it—this is truly lamentable.\" Thereupon, he bestowed upon Hanzhen three talismans, saying: \"These will provide for your clothing and food for life. They will infinitely multiply your hidden merits. Use the jade script to heal, and even a thousand demons or a hundred ailments will be cured. First apply one talisman; if it proves ineffective, then deploy the second. No affliction will resist the third. Aid the poor and sick, seek little gold or silk, and when your merit is full and your virtue complete, the Dao will be near.\" He then inscribed a wooden plaque with a twenty-character poem beneath the hempen curtain:\n\n*\"The world holds endless affairs,*\n*Life’s knowledge unfolds day by spring.*\n*Ask the road beyond the mundane—*\n*Straight is the path to Shangqing’s realm.\"*\n\nHe signed it: *\"Written by the Mountain Wanderer, Ma Ziran.\"* With that, he took his leave and was never seen again. Years later, word spread that Master Ma had ascended to heaven in broad daylight. From then on, Hanzhen’s talismans proved extraordinarily effective. From Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinling, and the Huai-Hai region—across a thousand *li* in all directions—letters and messengers flew to him, begging for his healing, their numbers beyond count. With the silver he earned, he founded the Eastern Sage Ancestral Hall, its halls adorned with cinnabar, emerald, gold, and azure, its painted murals renowned in their time. Hanzhen lived to over seventy, passing without illness, and all said he had already entered the registers of the Dao, one of the liberated.\n\n**Wu Shan Jing**\nWu Shan Jing studied the Dao on Mount Song for over a decade, diligently seeking grottoes and traversing secluded wonders. One day, he came upon a cavern entrance, over a *zhang* wide and five or six *chi* high. He entered slowly, and as he advanced, the space gradually widened. The candle flickered out, the path stretched far, and with no way to gauge distance, he groped forward. After two or three *li*, he felt as though enveloped in thick mist. After several more *li*, it suddenly brightened, the mountains and rivers unfolding before him, the view stretching endlessly in all directions. Beneath a rocky grotto, he saw five or six Daoists. He hurried forward to pay his respects, but by the time he arrived, only one remained. Shan Jing bowed and introduced himself, recounting his fortunate encounter and entreating the immortal for the essentials of prolonging life and transcending the world. The immortal, pleased, replied: \"Your earnest devotion is rare. That you have met me is the fruition of accumulated goodness. The Way of transcending the world requires one’s name to be inscribed in the Azure Register, and one must be born with immortal bones—this is not easily spoken of. Yet your longing for the Dao is pitiable.\" He then said: \"Return to the world of men; we shall meet again later.\" Pointing to several scrolls on a stone bed, he instructed Shan Jing to fetch one. When Shan Jing brought it, the immortal smiled: \"I cannot yet teach you the Way of leaving the world. For now, read this—it will allow you to collate scriptures in the human realm, discern celestial patterns, and decipher jade graphs, aiding rulers and augmenting your merit.\" He had Shan Jing read it, but Shan Jing recognized nothing. The immortal then imparted the secret gestures, repeating them earnestly. Shan Jing suddenly understood, grasping every detail. The immortal then sent him out of the mountain, directing him along another path. In an instant, he found himself in Luoyang.\n\nFrom then on, the jade scripts, red writings, treasure chapters, and true secrets in the scroll became as clear to him as clerical script. When Emperor Xianzong renovated the inner palace, a talisman was discovered within the bracket sets, unrecognized by anyone inside or outside the court. Someone mentioned that Shan Jing was skilled in celestial script, so he was summoned to the palace and shown the talisman. He read it fluently, without hesitation, and was rewarded with gold and silk. He was then ordered to annotate and present it. The emperor commanded the Taiqing Abbey to provide him with special support, and the Daoist Qiong of Xing Tang Abbey became his disciple, mastering all his secrets. Qiong transcribed the *Dao De Jing*, the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters of the Yellow Court*, the *Scripture of Life and Spirit*, the *Scripture of Disaster Dispelling*, and other texts—nearly ten scrolls—using celestial script and jade graphs. He also annotated the talismans of the Three Caverns, standardizing their pronunciation with seal script.\n\nIn the Xiantong era, Shan Jing was summoned to the three palaces and taught over seven hundred disciples, including Yi Xi Xian Sheng and Wan Yu Ke. The celestial scriptures he was to transcribe remained unfinished when Qiong passed away, so the emperor posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Zhao Xuan Xian Sheng*. Shan Jing lived in Luoyang for over ninety years, his appearance like that of a child, his teeth and hair unaged. He spoke of traveling the Five Ridges, then vanished without a trace. When Zhao Xuan died, he was over ninety. The celestial scriptures he had written were obtained by Wu Fang Yi, a Daoist from Shangrao, who took them to the Zhongnan Mountains. During the chaos of Huang Chao’s rebellion, they were scattered and lost.\n\n**Yang Huizhi**\nYang Huizhi journeyed east from Chang’an through Wu and Chu, arriving at Wujiang.\n\nHearing that Master Wang possessed profound arts of the Dao, Yang Huizhi sought him out at his gate. The master wore a black headscarf and coarse hempen robe, sitting with his arms resting on a low table, his bearing refined and elegant. Huizhi bowed twice in full reverence, and the master returned his salute with clasped hands, inviting him to sit. Their conversation flowed with lofty and unconstrained discourse. By evening, it was the twelfth day of the eighth month.\n\nThe master summoned his daughter, Seventh Maiden, who appeared as an old crone—over seventy years of age, her teeth and hair entirely withered, her steps halting and stooped as she arrived. The master said to Huizhi, “This is my daughter. Lazy and disinclined toward the Dao, she has now grown old.” Then, turning to Seventh Maiden, he instructed, “Carve a paper moon for this evening and place it upon the eastern wall of the chamber.” Soon after, Seventh Maiden affixed the paper moon to the eastern wall, and suddenly a radiant glow burst forth, illuminating the entire room so that even the finest details were discernible.\n\nMaster Wang and Huizhi conversed within the chamber, where a biting chill pressed upon them as if they stood halfway to heaven. As dawn approached and Huizhi prepared to take his leave, the master traced a line in the courtyard dust with his staff. When Huizhi looked again at their surroundings, he saw towering cliffs and ravines, forests of trees piercing the sky, and before them a vast expanse of water stretching beyond sight.\n\nHuizhi stood with the master at the water’s edge, trembling in awe and astonishment. He exclaimed, “How can such transformations occur! Last night’s encounter and this morning’s sight—could this be a single night in the realm of immortals, yet a thousand years in the world of men?” The master smiled and said, “I merely meant it as amusement.” With a shake of his robes and a wave of his hand, the courtyard and gate instantly returned to their former state. Huizhi fled in haste, daring not to glance back.\n\nFang Jian of Qinghe\n\nFang Jian of Qinghe dwelt in the mountains, prizing the extraordinary and devoted to the Dao. For twenty years, he studied the talismans of the Six Jia and the Nine Chapters of the True Register. Later, he journeyed to Mount Heng, where he encountered a Daoist adept. When he inquired about the immortal realms of Penglai and Fangzhang and the wonders of the spirit world, the adept recounted each in turn as if he had witnessed them himself. They traveled together for over ten days, and Fang Jian could not bear to part from him.\n\nAs Fang Jian prepared to set out for the Southern Sea, the Daoist said, “I have often wandered the Southern Sea these past ten years. The Protector-General Li once gifted me a jade hairpin, and as you are devoted to the Dao, I now bestow it upon you—treasure it well.” That autumn, Fang Jian arrived at the Southern Sea and wandered alone to the Kaiyuan Abbey. In its north gallery stood two clay statues of Perfected Ones, one named Zuo Xuan, the other You Xuan. Gazing at Zuo Xuan, Fang Jian saw that his appearance was identical to the Daoist he had met on Mount Heng. He marveled in astonishment for a long while, then noticed that the statue’s headdress lacked its hairpin. He asked the Daoists of the abbey, “What are these Perfected Ones called, and why is the hairpin missing from this one?” A Daoist replied, “Ten years ago, the Protector-General Li often adorned the Perfected One’s headdress with a jade hairpin, but it vanished some months past.”\n\nFang Jian recounted how the hairpin had been gifted to him on Mount Heng, then drew it from his pouch and restored it to the statue.\n\nThe Monk Qixu\n\nThe monk Qixu, surnamed Li, was the son of an imperial censor during the Kaiyuan era. From childhood, he was drawn to the teachings of the Buddha. At twenty, he shaved his head, donned a monk’s robe, and took up residence in a Buddhist temple in Chang’an. When Emperor Minghuang fled to Shu and the Jie Hu sacked the two capitals, Qixu entered Mount Taibai, where he subsisted on pine needles and abstained from grain. There he met the Daoist Master Qiao, a man of gaunt and lofty bearing, his beard and temples snowy white. Master Qiao said to Qixu, “Your spirit and bones are solitary and refined—you are destined to wander the immortal realms.” Qixu humbly declined the praise.\n\nMaster Qiao continued, “One day, when you are at Mount Shang preparing food, you will encounter a porter at an inn. Offer him provisions, and if he asks what you seek, say only that you wish to journey to Zhichuan. He will guide you there.” After An Lushan’s rebellion was quelled and the Supreme Emperor returned to the capital, the realm knew peace once more. Qixu then went to an inn at Mount Shang, where he prepared meals and offered them to porters. For nearly half a year, he fed hundreds of them, yet none inquired after his purpose. Growing weary, Qixu concluded that Master Qiao had deceived him and prepared to return to Chang’an.\n\nThen, one day, he encountered a young porter by a river. The youth asked where Qixu was bound, and he replied, “I have long wished to journey to Zhichuan.” The porter exclaimed in surprise, “Zhichuan is an immortal’s abode—how could one reach it?” Qixu said, “From childhood, I have been devoted to the Dao. I once met a perfected one who urged me to seek Zhichuan, though I know not the way.” The porter said, “Come with me, and I will take you there.”\n\nTogether, they traveled to Shangli in Lantian, then ascended Mount Yu, traversing perilous cliffs and jagged crags for over eighty li. They came to a cavern from which water flowed. The porter and Qixu carried stones to dam the stream, and after three days, the water ceased. They entered the cavern, where darkness made it impossible to see. In the distance, a gate appeared, some ten li away. They walked toward it, and upon emerging, found the wind and sunlight gentle, the mountains and waters clear and lovely.\n\nAfter journeying over a hundred li, they climbed a towering peak, its summit sheer and its stone path treacherous. Qixu grew dizzy and dared not proceed, but the porter said, “The immortal realm is near—do not turn back now.” Taking his hand, he led him upward. At the summit, they found a vast, level expanse, from which the peaks and rivers below were indistinct. They traveled another hundred li and entered another cavern, then emerged after several dozen li to see an endless expanse of water. A stone path, barely a foot wide, stretched across it for a hundred li. The porter led Qixu onto the path, and with trembling steps, they crossed, daring not look down.\n\nAt last, they reached the foot of a mountain, where a colossal tree stood, its branches lush and verdant, towering over a hundred feet. The porter climbed the tree and let out a long whistle. After a time, a wind stirred the treetops, and suddenly a thick rope descended from the mountain’s summit, bearing a bamboo basket. The porter and Qixu entered the basket, closed their eyes, and sat in tense stillness as if soaring upward. A great rope pulled them aloft, and soon they reached the summit.\n\nThere, cities and palaces gleamed with pearls and jade, suspended beyond the clouds.

      "translated_text": "**Wang Gao**\n\nWang Gao was a native of Xiangnan. His family lived near the Wang Qiao Abbey, an ancient site of construction, where halls, terraces, and pavilions had once been wondrous in their craftsmanship. Over the years, however, brambles had overgrown the grounds, and the structures had gradually fallen into ruin. Gao often felt distressed by this but lacked the means to restore them. He maintained only the offerings to the images and statues, and when his farming yielded a modest surplus, he would immediately discuss repairs.\n\nOne of his family’s cowherds tended cattle near the abbey and often encountered a villager—a man with ruddy complexion and short hair, stronger than most, who enjoyed playing with him. When they wrestled, the cowherd usually lost. The man would wait for the boy’s arrival and then frolic with him. Once, when Gao scolded the cowherd for returning late, the boy explained the reason. Gao said, “If he were a ghost or spirit, his body would be light and ethereal.” The boy replied, “His body is ethereal, yet heavy, and he speaks little, moving slowly.” Gao said, “Go again tomorrow, and I will follow to observe. If he offers his strength, I will help you capture him.”\n\nThe next day, the cowherd returned, and the man appeared again. When he exerted his strength, Gao joined the boy in subduing him—only to find he was a golden statue. It was light when carried away but grew heavy upon reaching home, weighing several thousand *jin*. On its back was inscribed: *“For the repair of the abbey, in gratitude to Wang Gao.”* Gao sold the gold to restore the abbey, and the work was completed in a few years. His descendants remain wealthy to this day.\n\n---\n\n**Ji Zonglao**\n\nJi Zonglao was a Daoist from Yuzhang. He wandered through famous mountains, seeking masters and pursuing learning, yet had found nothing of substance. In the second year of the *Dazhong* era (848 C.E.), the year of *wuchen*, while staying at a village abbey in Shuzhou, he encountered a Daoist dressed in tattered robes, braving a fierce wind and snow. The man suddenly appeared, seeking shelter in the abbey. Zonglao shared a room with him for the night. When darkness fell, there were no lamps, and the snowstorm raged on. Suddenly, a light appeared in the room. Peering through a crack, Zonglao saw no flame, yet the space was illuminated. A small gourd emitted a gentle glow, suffusing the curtains, bedding, utensils, and clothing—everything was visible. Realizing the man was extraordinary, Zonglao knocked on his door and sought an audience, but the Daoist did not respond, and the light soon faded. Zonglao sat outside his door all night, hoping to catch a glimpse of him at dawn. When morning came, he pushed open the door, but the Daoist had vanished. Filled with remorse, Zonglao traveled the world in search of him.\n\n---\n\n**He Daozhang**\n\nHe Daozhang was a Daoist from Tianmu Mountain in Kuizhou. Diligent in his practice and devotions, he was revered far and wide. The offerings and alms he received from incense, lamps, and ritual feasts were all used to restore the abbey’s halls and commission images and statues.",

      "translated_text": "Though the altars lay in ruins and the halls in decay—wherever there remained traces of the ancient mysteries of the Daoist gate—he would spare no effort to restore them. Such deeds were many. When the Tianmu Abbey was reduced to ashes by wildfire, leaving scarcely a roof standing, he took up basket and spade himself and labored for five or six years until its towers and halls stood renewed.\n\nEast of Tianmu, sheer cliffs rose, crowned by a withered tree. Beneath it, lights often flickered. Daozhang resolved to plant pines and cypresses there, and as he felled the deadwood, the cliffside crumbled away. Within the rockface yawned a hollow, and inside lay over seventy scrolls of the *Ancient Scriptures of Supreme Clarity*—their cinnabar and ink calligraphy as fresh as if newly inscribed. Yet with construction still underway, he had no time to examine them. A Daoist who borrowed the texts attempted to steal them away in secret, but suddenly darkness fell in a storm, and the scriptures vanished. Once lost, they were never found again.\n\n**Xie Zhen**\n\nXie Zhen was a craftsman from Linye, skilled in plasterwork and meticulous in execution. Once, while repairing the mud-and-lime cranes of the Crane-Cry Abbey’s *Palace of Supreme Clarity*—a temple built in Sichuan during the Heavenly Master’s time—he applied himself with such precision and care that every stroke was flawless. Suddenly, a Daoist entered with two attendants, his bearing extraordinary, his stature towering to nine feet. Addressing Zhen, he said, “It is rare to find such devotion in these mountain repairs. I am humbled by your diligence.” With his finger, he traced a talisman upon the ground, instructing Zhen to memorize it carefully. “From now on,” he said, “if the sick seek healing—even from a thousand *li* away—this talisman will prove effective. Do not charge exorbitantly; let it suffice to sustain your household.” Zhen committed the talisman to memory, and when he put it into practice, its efficacy was profound.

      "translated_text": "Li Ji would gather firewood and rest beneath a great tree, where he noticed a scroll lodged among its branches. Taking it down, he found that though some characters were recognizable, they were mostly the names of ghosts and spirits. As he read these names aloud, the ghosts and spirits answered his call. His parents, astonished by this, secretly copied the unfamiliar characters and sought others to decipher them. Thereafter, Li Ji could read and summon the names of ghosts and spirits himself, and each time they responded without fail. He thus gained the power to command them—concealing his form, treading upon water, or reversing its flow with a shout, performing myriad transformations with effortless mastery. Some suspected sorcery and sought to seize him for the authorities, but he declared, “I merely play with the arts; I bring no harm to others. Why treat this as strange?” He later withdrew to Yangshuo Mountain to cultivate the Dao, and to this day, he remains there.\n\n**Ye Qianshao**\n\nYe Qianshao was a native of Xinzhou. In his youth, while gathering firewood, he took shelter from the rain beneath a great tree. Suddenly, he saw the Thunder God trapped between its branches, struggling in vain to break free. The branches had snapped shut after a thunderclap, pinning him fast. Ye Qianshao pried them apart with a stone wedge, allowing the Thunder God to escape. Deeply grateful, the Thunder God said, “Return here tomorrow at this same hour.” Ye Qianshao did as instructed, and the next day, the Thunder God reappeared beneath the tree. Handing him a scroll of ink talismans, he said, “Use these to summon thunder and rain, cure ailments, and swiftly aid those in need. I have four brothers—when you call for thunder, summon *Lei Da* and *Lei Er*, and we will answer. But remember: we five are of fierce and impatient temper. Do not call us unless the matter is urgent.”\n\nFrom then on, whenever Ye Qianshao deployed the talismans to summon rain, their efficacy was extraordinary. Once, while drunk in the marketplace of Jizhou, he was seized by the prefect, who berated him and threatened humiliation. From beneath the eaves, Ye Qianshao cried out, “Lei Wu!” Though the day was scorching and rainless, a deafening thunderclap resounded at once, sending the crowd into disarray. The prefect descended the steps to receive him with reverence, begging him to bring rain. That very night, a torrential downpour fell, and the drought was broken. His fame spread far and wide.\n\nLater, while traveling in Huazhou, he encountered a prolonged deluge that had caused the Yellow River to overflow, forcing officials to labor day and night to contain the flood. Ye Qianshao took an iron rod two feet long, inscribed a talisman upon it, and planted it on the riverbank. The surging waters receded, forming a mound-like barrier, and flowed downstream without daring to breach the talisman’s bounds. Those who witnessed the rescue of the drowning still speak of it today.\n\nWhenever the sick sought his talismans, he would write them without regard for brush or ink, and all who received them found relief. He wandered often through the regions of Jiang and Zhe, fond of meat and wine, and cared little for ascetic discipline. His later whereabouts remain unknown.",

One day, a young Daoist priest stood in the middle of the road and, seeing him, asked: “I have a load of clothing and hat brims that need carrying into Chengdu. Would you do it?” Yubin agreed, and they set off together until they reached the northern street of Dashu Market. The sun had just passed the hour of *chen* when the Daoist said to him: “It is not yet noon, so we cannot stay here. We must go straight to the mountains.” Yubin followed him further, and by dusk, they had arrived at the gate of Mount Qingcheng. Passing through a spirit shrine and into a bamboo grove, they came upon a cluster of ten or so small huts. The Daoist unlocked one himself. Inside, the rooms were clean and tidy, though no one else lived there. He instructed Yubin to fetch fire from the shrine, while he himself gathered wild vegetables from the hedgerows. He cooked them and shared the meal, then said: “I do not wish to keep you here overnight, but if I send you away, I have no money to give. Here is a booklet for you.” He opened several pages to show Yubin the writing inside. It read: “This formula can transform the beard and hair. If you prepare it according to the instructions, you will have clothing and food for life, and you are certain to encounter good fortune.” Yubin then left the mountain and, upon reaching Shipopo Inn, calculated the distance he had traveled—over two hundred *li* from dawn to dusk. He prepared the medicine according to the formula, and it proved highly effective. When the Duke of Yan, the Prime Minister, was in Shu, he summoned Yubin, bestowed upon him a cap and robe, and gave him the name Yubin. The booklet contained only this one formula, with no other text, and no one else ever obtained it. His later years were spent in Manchuan.",

On the third day of the third month, Yumanchuan went to Zhenguan Monastery on Mount Xueshe to visit the silkworm market. There, he saw the old water-seller and spoke with him, learning that he lived nearby. The old man led him through the market, and after they had seen everything, he invited Yumanchuan to his home. They entered a path lined with orange and bamboo trees, crossed ditches and channels for about ten *li*, and then saw gates and halls, with figures bustling about—paintings and murals adorned the place like a grand Daoist temple. They were led into a great kitchen, where many people were gathered, but the old man had vanished. When Yumanchuan asked where he was, he was told that the old man had transformed into a kitchen spirit in Ge Suohua. It was said that the next day’s silkworm market would host a grand vegetarian feast, and in the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. The old water-seller never returned again.\n\nMaster Hou the Celestial Master was from Mutou Market in Jiulong. During the silkworm market at Ge Suohua, he accidentally damaged the clothing bundle of a Daoist traveler and was seized with terror. The Daoist, however, showed no anger and instead gave him a talisman, saying, “If you copy this and follow its instructions, you can cure various illnesses and secure clothing and food for life.” Hou did as instructed, and the talisman proved increasingly effective over time. Initially, it was called the Celestial Master’s Talisman, but now people refer to him as Master Hou the Celestial Master.\n\nThe Han Clan Maiden was from Zhen Duo Hua in Luoxian.

During the Baoli era, Cui Xuanliang was appointed Prefect of Huzhou. He conducted the Yellow Register Retreat at the Purple Ultimate Palace, where three hundred and sixty-five cranes descended upon the altar. Among them, one crane perched atop the Tower of the Void Sovereign—its body radiant white, save for its crimson crown. Purple qi suffused the altar grounds, lingering from dawn until dusk before dissipating. The Prefect of Hangzhou, Bai Juyi, composed a eulogy:\n\n*\"O bird, O bird,\nFrom the northwest you came,\nCrimson-crowned, flame-tipped,\nWhite plumage like snow unfurled.\nBeyond the Liao waters you flew,\nYet never past Mount Wei—\nAh, in Wuxing’s domain,\nWhy did you alight here?\"*\n\nAt the beginning of the Baoli era, during the Three Primordials and Four Retreats, as the rites proceeded in broad daylight, purple clouds descended, accompanying the three hundred and sixty cranes in circling the altar. Above, they illuminated the mysteries of the Dao; below, they graced the realm of immortals. Who dwelled here? The Prefect, Cui Xuanliang, was deeply moved, redoubling his devotion. One day, while reciting the *Huangting Jing* in his quiet chamber, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room. He died without illness, and when his coffin was carried for burial, it was as light as if it held only his robes. Xuanliang’s son, serving in the Jinling administration, cast off his official garb and departed, dwelling on Mount Mao. There, he found contentment in zither and wine, and like his father, shed his form to depart the world.\n\nIt is said that the Prefect of Huzhou, who often recited the *Huangting Jing* and the *Duren Jing*, would hold an incense burner in his quiet chamber as he chanted the scriptures.

At his private retreat in Kaihua, he built a seclusion chamber where, every three to five days, he would open the room, burn incense, and remain within for an entire day before emerging. At times, immortals descended to him, and wondrous smoke and rare fragrances were often seen and smelled throughout the courtyard.\n\nDuring his meditations, a youth in azure led him to a towering mountain in the heavens, where he paid homage to the Lord Lao. There, he witnessed the celestial register appointing Master Zhang as the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, succeeding the office of Perfected Yin. Earlier, Yin had debated merits with the Three Heavens before the Most High, who declared: \"The barbarian hordes have ravaged the Central Plains, devouring the land of Hua like silkworms, and this failure to restrain them is the fault of Perfected Yin. Yet the twenty-four transformations established to distinguish between humans and spirits, bringing blessings to all living beings, are the achievements of Daoling. These two must each ascend the terrace to reflect and be tested by the Great Dao.\"\n\nThereupon, Perfected Yin was commanded to ascend a jeweled terrace of a single lotus, where he sat in solemn stillness. Soon, the scene grew dim and murky. Then Daoling was also ordered to mount the terrace. After sitting for a long while, extraordinary hues and radiant lights manifested in myriad transformations, and the realms of humans and heavens rejoiced together. From that time, Daoling succeeded Yin as the Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm.\n\nIn the year *yiwei*, I heard Linghu’s account. In the year *dingyou*, while in Mengyang in western Sichuan, I met Daoist Zhang, who said that the Heavenly Master had descended to transmit the Daoist teachings. Revered by all near and far, he recounted the Heavenly Master’s elevation to the office of Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm. His account matched Linghu’s in every detail, with no discrepancy in the debate of merits or the ascension of the terrace. The profound workings of the Dao remain obscure and unverifiable; I merely record these marvels.\n\nLi Quan, styled Daguanzi, dwelled on Mount Shaoshi. Fond of the Way of immortals, he often traveled to famous mountains, collecting esoteric methods. At Tiger Mouth Crag on Mount Song, he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman*, written on silk and bound with cinnabar lacquered rollers, sealed in a jade casket. The inscription read: \"Seventh day of the seventh month, first year of the Taiwei era of the Great Wei.\" The Shangqing Daoist Kou Qianzhi had concealed it among the famous mountains to transmit to like-minded seekers, but the original had decayed. Quan copied and read it thousands of times yet never grasped its meaning.",

Her topknot sat high upon her head, the rest of her hair hanging loosely; clad in tattered robes, she leaned upon a staff, her bearing most singular. By the roadside, she saw a tree scorched by an abandoned fire and remarked to herself: \"Fire is born of wood, yet calamity inevitably consumes its source.\" Quan, startled, asked her: \"This is a passage from the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman*—how do you know these words?\" The woman replied: \"I have received this talisman for three *yuan* and six cycles of sixty years. How did one so young come by it?\" Quan bowed deeply, prostrating himself, and recounted how he had obtained it. The woman said: \"Your bones, young one, align with the Gate of Life; your fate is as balanced as the Sun’s Angle. Your blood and marrow remain unspent, your heart’s reflection unwarped. Wise and devoted to the method, you are both spiritually bold and joyfully discerning—truly my disciple. Yet at forty-five, you shall face a great sigh.\" Thereupon, she produced a cinnabar-written talisman, threading it onto the tip of her staff. She bade Quan kneel and swallow it, saying: \"May Heaven and Earth protect you.\" Then, seated upon a stone, she expounded the meaning of the *Hidden Talisman* to him: \"This talisman contains three hundred words in all: one hundred expound the Dao, one hundred expound the method, and one hundred expound the technique. Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing unity; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the techniques for strengthening armies and securing victory.

Relying on its ingenuity, even Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Han Xin, and Bai Qi would find nothing extraordinary in it. Only those of the Dao may be permitted to hear it—thus the perfected employ it to attain the Dao, the noble employ it to master its techniques, and the common employ it only to invite misfortune, for their capacities differ.\n\nWhen transmitting it to those of like aspiration, one must first purify oneself through fasting; those with the root become masters, those without remain disciples.

Each year on the seventh day of the seventh month, copy a version and conceal it within a famous mountain’s stone cavern to gain fifteen additional years of fate.\n\nAfter some time, the mother said: \"The sun has set; I have millet porridge—let us eat together.\" From her sleeve she produced a gourd and bade Quan fetch water from the valley. Once filled, the gourd suddenly weighed over a hundred *jin*; unable to control it, he let it sink into the spring. Upon returning, his mother had vanished, leaving only several *sheng* of millet porridge. Quan ate it and thereafter abstained from grain.\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, he served as Vice Military Commissioner of Jiangling and Censor-in-Chief. Quan possessed military strategy and composed the *Tai Bai Yin Jing* in ten fascicles, as well as the *Zhong Tai Zhi* in ten fascicles. At the time, he was sidelined by Li Linfu and never attained high office. Eventually, he entered the famous mountains in search of the Dao, and his later whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n**Elder Deng**\nElder Deng dwelled in Changjiang of Suizhou, near the border of Tongquan. His estate spanned several thousand *mu*, with an ancient Daoist abbey standing amidst the fields. Amidst the ravages of war, households scattered, livelihoods collapsed, and fertile lands reverted to wilderness, yet his afflictions never ceased.\n\nOne day, while walking through the abbey, he saw scriptures strewn about. As he gathered and rolled them, an old man suddenly appeared and said: \"This is Lord Lao’s *Pillow Scripture*. If you recite it diligently, blessings will come, and calamities will not touch you.\" Deng listened respectfully and took the small scroll the old man indicated. When he finished tidying up, the old man had vanished.\n\nThereafter, he recited the *Pillow Scripture* through the nights, totaling several thousand repetitions. Within a year or two, his household prospered, and even amidst the chaos of war, he knew no fear. A man named Kang Gong of Chengdu, who often visited his home, obtained the scripture and recited it with devotion. When the city was besieged and many perished, Kang’s family of over ten, though lacking provisions, remained unharmed, escaping disaster. To this day, Kang’s descendants continue to uphold this scripture.\n\n**Yang Chu**\nYang Chu was a native of Chengdu. Wealthy, he resided in the Gold and Silver Market of the Eastern Market, serving his parents with filial piety, earning praise from kin and friends. While visiting Ge Xian Abbey, he encountered the true portrait of Perfected Luo Gongyuan and made daily offerings of incense and lamps.\n\nYears later, when the Prince of Shu occupied Chengdu, heavy taxes were levied, and both public and private coffers were drained. Yang’s family exhausted their resources, paying seven hundred thousand in military tribute, pledging their estate to cover half. One evening, officials pressed for payment, and fearing his mother’s distress, he dared not inform her.\n\nSuddenly, a villager spoke to him: \"The official debt is urgent—how will you manage?\" Yang explained his plight, and the man instructed him to procure raw iron and prepare charcoal. That night, the man lodged at Yang’s home, filling the furnace with iron and charcoal to forge it, drinking wine together. By evening, he left Yang with an elixir, saying: \"Use half this gold for the official debt and half to restore your estate. I am Perfected Luo of Qingcheng; meet me on Qingcheng Mountain. Consume this elixir, and we shall see each other there.\" With that, he departed. The iron had transformed into gold.",

Upon his return, he gave the remaining elixir to his mother; though she was already advanced in years, her hair turned black, and within half a year, her ailments were cured.\n\nLiu Yanguang was a native of Lubi Village in Jinling. He once served as an official in the Zhexi headquarters under Military Commissioner Tang Ruoshan. Ruoshan was devoted to the Dao, and both he and his younger brother Ruoshui encountered immortals, who imparted to them the essentials of the Way. During the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang favored Ruoshan with exceptional regard, granting him the staff of authority to govern Zhexi. After a year, Ruoshan abandoned his post and set sail upon the sea, leaving a memorial in his boat. The surveillance commissioner reported the matter to the throne, and an edict ordered Ruoshui to search for him among the immortal mountains of Jiangling, though his whereabouts remained unknown.\n\nA decade later, Yanguang was dispatched on a mission to Yangzhou. At the fish market, he encountered Ruoshan, who was selling fish beneath an awning. Ruoshan summoned Yanguang to his home. The lanes were narrow and dilapidated, the paths overgrown with weeds, the dew-laden grasses soaking passersby, barely allowing room for a person to walk. Yet upon entering the gate, the ground gradually leveled, paved with bricks and adorned with flowers. The pavilions and terraces were embellished with luxuries rarely seen in the mortal world. Ruoshan bade him sit and served him food.\n\nLearning that Yanguang still owed official debts and that his household was destitute, Ruoshan pitied him, his concern evident in his expression. Later, he instructed Yanguang to prepare raw iron and charcoal at his lodging. That evening, Tang arrived at the inn, placed the iron and charcoal in a blazing fire, and departed, saying: \"Your descendants in future generations are destined to encounter the Dao in the immortal mountains; you should not remain in minor official posts but instead preserve your integrity in reclusion among the hills and gardens. Use one-third of this gold to settle your official debts, and the remaining two-thirds to enrich your estate.

Yan'guang used the gold as instructed to repay his official debts and established his household at Lübi. He lived to eighty or ninety years of age, and in later years, his grandson Song entered the Dao at Mount Tiantai.\n\n**Master Feng Zun**\nMaster Feng Zun’s origins were unknown. Initially a novice, he traveled to Maoyou Mountain in Songyang County, Chuzhou, where he resided for months at the former abode of Master Ye. He petitioned his master to be ordained as a Daoist and was permitted to dwell on Maoyou Mountain. His master departed, leaving him alone on the mountain. Feng sold his robes to purchase materials, constructing a thatched hut of reeds and timber. Once completed, wildfire consumed it. He again entreated the villagers for bamboo and wood, rebuilding as before—only for it to burn once more. For months, he sheltered beneath a cliff, enduring repeated trials by strange beings that sought to deter his resolve. Then Master Ye descended and bestowed upon him a white elixir, the size of a pea, saying: \"This year, a great pestilence will strike. Use this elixir to save lives—one pill will cure an entire household’s affliction.\" With a single *dou* of the elixir, he healed countless sufferers. The grateful people donated wealth, tiles, and timber, constructing halls, bell towers, altars, and cloisters atop the mountain. Within a year, all was complete.\n\nWhen Prefect Chen Ru of Quzhou fell ill, he summoned Feng to treat him, but Feng refused despite the lavish offerings. Chen soon passed away. His younger brother, the regional governor, donated gold and silk to support Feng’s meritorious works. During the Zhongyuan Festival, Feng invited over twenty Daoist priests to perform a fifteen-night *Huanglu* ritual. The moon shone as bright as day, the sky cloudless. Suddenly, a freezing gale arose, and thunder cracked. Mid-ritual, Feng vanished. A fragrant mist enveloped the mountain, astonishing all. Moments later, Feng reappeared, saying: \"Just now, Master Ye and the Three Heavens’ Master Zhang descended, gifting me a divine sword. They commanded me to cultivate here and await further decree, after which I shall emerge to wield this sword in service of the realm.\" Before the altar lay a sword over three *chi* long, alongside a scroll four to five *chi* in length and three *chi* wide—similar to mortal paper yet vastly larger, beyond human craftsmanship.\n\nGovernor Lu, hearing of the divine sword, established a *Huanglu* altar in the grand hall and invited Feng and the Daoist assembly to escort the sword into the prefecture in a decorated palanquin. Two to three hundred paces from the city gates, the sword leapt like lightning into the altar’s heart, where it remained for some time. Lu wished to present it to the military commissioner, but Feng said: \"Master Ye declared that when the time comes to aid the nation, the Supreme Decree will arrive. Now is not that time—it must not be prematurely revealed.\" Lu assented, and the sword remains on Maoyou Mountain to this day. Master Ye once told others: \"A hundred and sixty years hence, one surpassing my arts will dwell here.\" Now, Feng has fulfilled his prophecy.\n\n**Song Wencai**\nSong Wencai was a native of Pengshan County in Meizhou. Once, while traveling with several companions to the summit of Mount Emei, he lost his headscarf and sandals while searching for them. Separated from his group, he encountered an old man who led him onward. The path widened into vast plains adorned with rare flowers and precious trees. After several hundred paces, they arrived at a palace of jade steps and cloud-piercing towers—sights unseen in the mortal world. The old man guided him to a terrace of pearl and medicinal herbs, where he beheld the surrounding peaks. A game of *weiqi* was laid upon the ground, Daoists played, azure youths gathered herbs, clear streams cascaded over stones, and sacred cranes soared in the sky. Astonished, Wencai asked the old man: \"Where is this place?\"",

      "translated_text": "Pengl Qiu\n\nPengl Qiu, styled Bojian, was a native of Beihai. During the Tai Shi era of the Jin dynasty, he entered the Jade Maiden Mountain west of Beiqiu to fell timber. Suddenly, he detected a strange fragrance and followed the scent with the wind. The mountain parted of its own accord, revealing towering palaces and sprawling halls, their terraces and pavilions grand and expansive. Qiu entered through the gate and peered inside, where he saw five jade trees. Advancing slightly, he beheld four immortal maidens playing *weiqi* in the hall. Upon seeing Qiu, they all rose in surprise and asked, “Master Peng, how have you come here?” Qiu replied, “I followed the fragrance.” With that, they resumed their game as before. A younger maiden ascended a tower, plucking her zither in jest and singing, *“Why does Yuanhui alone ascend the tower?”* Qiu stood by one of the trees, and feeling hungry, licked the dew that dripped from its leaves.\n\nPresently, a woman arrived riding a crane and said, “Yuhua, why have you allowed this mortal here?” She added, “The Queen Mother—now known as Wang Fangping—is inspecting the chambers of the immortals. You must send him away at once.” Terrified, Qiu fled through the gate, and when he turned back, all had vanished. Upon returning home, he found it was already the Jianping era. The old villagers and his former dwelling had become ruins and graves. Thereafter, he wandered through famous mountains in search of the Dao and never returned.\n\nWang Kejiao\n\nWang Kejiao was a native of Kunshan in Suzhou. Originally a farmer, he had no knowledge of the Dao. At the age of several years, his eyes began emitting a five-colored light, which intensified at night, allowing him to see clearly even in pitch darkness. Some said to his kin, “This is an affliction—when the light fades, he will lose his sight.” His parents, in their ignorance, summoned a common physician to cauterize his eyes, and the light vanished.\n\nIn the eleventh month of the tenth year of the Xiantong era, Kejiao was returning home from the market when he saw a large barge on the river, adorned with gold and brocade, embellished with pearls and kingfisher feathers, and filled with music. Kejiao stood watching as the barge drew near the shore. A youth in azure robes beckoned him aboard, where he saw over ten figures in towering crowns and feathered robes, their garments patterned with clouds, mist, mountains, and rivers, each holding a musical instrument. One of them announced, “Uncle Wang the Third wishes to meet you, though we know not whence he comes.” Another remarked, “His immortal bones have been damaged by fire. He must not drink wine, and if he abstains from food for ten years, he may attain the Dao.” They gave him a chestnut, instructing him to eat it. Kejiao consumed half, keeping the other half in his hand.",

There, he spoke through the night with his close friend Gao Tan until the dim glow of predawn. Then, clad in a paper Daoist robe and holding a bamboo slip, he knelt upright and transformed.

From then on, ramparts multiplied across the Central Plains, and famine spread far and near, all as the Daoists had foretold.\n\nTu’s transformation—kneeling with a tablet—along with his brother’s seated passing, were not Confucian customs; thus, his brother stretched out Tu’s legs and seated him properly.

A worker descended with a rope and saw rows of jars lining the cave—over ten in all—filling both walls, their interiors brimming with blood-red water. There were also many small vessels, neither bronze nor gold yet gleaming, their engravings so exquisite they seemed beyond human craft. As the cavern deepened, fear drove him out. He took the smallest vessel to show outside, but upon emerging, it vanished. The cave was then resealed with stone.\n\nLater, someone found a bronze jar in a nearby grove, holding six or seven *dou* of the same crimson liquid. When poured into a stream, the water turned red for days. An old woman also discovered a patterned stone, lustrous and fine.

Each time it was cast into fire, the same fragrance arose, though it eventually disappeared.\n\nAt the time, a local villager received a prophecy: \"Beneath Mount Bian lies priceless incense and the elixir of immortality.\" This matched the old woman’s fragrant stone and Wu Fan’s ten jars of crimson water, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nWang Sheng\nWang Sheng once traveled through Wucheng in Huzhou, passing beneath Mount Jinzi.",

One day, he suddenly said to Xuanzhen, \"I wish to paint your portrait—may I?\" Xuanzhen smiled and replied, \"If you wish to paint a portrait, you must first paint yourself.\"\n\nWuzi followed his advice, holding a mirror and dipping his brush to capture his own likeness. His strokes were lifelike, and the portrait was completed in an instant. He then composed a eulogy and two poems, leaving them for Xuanzhen. Neither the eulogy nor the poems showed any sign of deliberation. The eulogy read:\n\n*Wuzi, of no talent,\nKnows fate and follows the true.\nHis aspirations lean toward the mysterious and plain,\nHis heart delights in purity and poverty.\nHe wanders through countless mountains,\nA solitary figure.\nHis learning has not yet illuminated the Dao,\nBut his form preserves the spirit.\nMountains and rivers are his home,\nHis shadow his only companion.\nClad in hempen robes and a grass belt,\nA deer-hide cap and gauze turban.\nHe eats pine nuts and drinks from springs,\nTraversing Shu and passing through Qin.\nThe great Dao is profound and obscure—\nWho is my teacher?\nGazing upon the earth below,\nI long for the celestial guests above.\nBoundless and untethered,\nI am intimate only with the formless.*\n\nThe poems read:\n\n*All day in the thatched hall I inquire,\nThe clear wind ever comes and goes.\nMy ears are free from worldly clamor,\nMy heart at ease with the vast clouds.\nFacing wine, I think only of the moon,\nFeasting on pine, I tire not of the mountains.\nOften I chant the Inner Landscape,\nNaturally preserving a youthful face.*\n\n*This life, these things—my livelihood,\nWhite stones and green pines are my home.\nFacing the moon, I see clouds like wild deer,\nFrom time to time, I buy wine to intoxicate with mist and rosy clouds.*\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n*Silent and solitary in my wanderings,\nI stand alone in stillness.\nI drink the dew that falls from magnolias,\nClothe myself in the shed fur of beasts.\nI seek no profit in the human world,\nNor sell my name beneath the heavens.\nSuch is the Daoist who dwells in the mountains.*\n\nHaving inscribed these words, he adjusted his robes, gathered his staff, and departed—no one knew where he went.\n\n**Bai Zhuangfu**\nBai Zhuangfu, styled Yongnian, was a native of Mount Heng in Hunan. From youth, he harbored lofty aspirations and studied the Way of immortals. On the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, he would visit the various abbeys of the mountain, assisting in the rituals of incense-burning and morning audiences, and inquiring into the profound classics and the mysteries of the true. His conduct was greatly admired by those of refined sensibilities. Even in tasks like gathering firewood and drawing water, he diligently sought instruction from masters, never considering it beneath him.",

      "translated_text": "Having obtained the alchemical scriptures, he mastered the arts of pacing the void and dispelling malevolence. After twenty years of cultivation, he thereby aided the common folk and saved the people, punishing demonic foxes and curing illnesses—many relied on his power. When the rebel bandits besieged the capital and the imperial cortege fled west, the realm was plunged into chaos, its order unraveling. Warlords and violent chieftains arose everywhere, defying law and discipline. The Master invariably admonished them with the principles of right and wrong, and many heeded his teachings.\n\nAt that time, there was a powerful warlord in the region—his name now lost—who once arranged a marriage for his son. On the morning before the wedding day, a youth suddenly appeared, accompanied by over ten riders, their origin unknown. He strode directly into the hall, sat with legs splayed, and berated the warlord: *\"I had first sought to betroth the daughter of such-and-such a family—why have you stolen her?\"* Though the household was alarmed, none dared respond. The youth then ordered his followers to retrieve the betrothal gifts—bundles of deep-red lambskin, black silk coins, and bolts of fine cloth—and return them, demanding the bride be handed over. Suspecting him to be a demonic entity, the warlord had no means to resist. He dispatched a swift runner over a hundred *li* to summon the Master and seek his aid.\n\nAs the Master approached, the youth showed no fear. After a long while, he suddenly muttered to himself: *\"The Venerable Master Bai has indeed come.\"* Then, weeping bitterly, he leapt onto the roof, let out several wails, and vanished. The returned betrothal gifts remained, and the Master distributed them to the poor and ailing. He expounded the principles of retribution and moral order to the warlord, who, recognizing his wrongdoing, disbanded his fortifications, relaxed his military defenses, and returned to the register of common folk. The provincial governor and prefects praised his conduct, and throughout the regions of Hunan and Hengyang, whether in matters of worth or unworthiness, all extolled the Master’s virtue and revered his teachings.\n\nOne day, a woodcutter knocked at his door and said: *\"On the western peak, immortals are gathered in conversation—you should go to them.\"* The Master suspected the woodcutter might be a mountain spirit in disguise. He fixed his gaze upon the man’s eyes to discern truth from falsehood. Just as he gathered his robes to depart, the woodcutter said: *\"Your merit and conduct are already recorded in the registers of immortality—what demon would dare deceive you? Yet even the slightest misstep may bring regret.\"* With that, he took another path and left. The Master followed with his staff, but by the time he arrived, dusk had fallen. He saw only a radiant glow upon the cliff face. Peering closely, he found a poem there, its ink still fresh:\n\n*On a clear autumn day, with nothing to do,*\n*I ride the mist to the distant sky.*\n*Relying on the woodcutter’s words,*\n*I await Bai Yongnian’s arrival.*\n\nAs soon as he finished reading, the characters vanished from the blank wall, and the light faded. The woodcutter was nowhere to be seen.\n\n**Li Yan**\nDuring his tenure as military governor of Qiannan, Li Yan governed a region where Anju Mountain stood—a towering cliff hundreds of feet high, overlooking a river, with a sacred cave at its summit. The locals did not know its name but believed immortals dwelled there. Those who sought to pay homage would sail beneath it and strike the side of their boat, whereupon clouds and fragrant vapors would arise in response. The villagers reported this to Lord Li, who ordered Daoist priests to embark in a great vessel, preparing pure vegetarian offerings and solemn rites. Dozens of true immortals then descended in succession upon the cliff’s peak to observe the ceremony. For three or four days, they remained visible. Even now, those who make supplications there often catch glimpses of them.\n\n**Li Ban**\nLi Ban was a man of the Fu Qin dynasty, fond of Daoist arts. He often wandered the caves of Youchuan Mountain southwest of Weiguo County. The mountain’s streams flowed year-round, appearing like white silk from a distance, and gourd leaves would sometimes drift upon the water. Li Ban entered the cave and followed it for over three hundred paces until he emerged into a vast, luminous space. Within stood halls, beds, scriptures, and tables. Two white-haired elders with forked topknots sat facing each other on a dais. Li Ban bowed before them, and one turned to him, saying: *\"You should return—it is not fitting to linger.\"* He took his leave and, upon reaching the cave’s mouth, found several gourds. As he reached to eat one, it turned to stone. Following the same path home, his family told him: *\"You have been gone forty years.\"*\n\n**Pei Chen**\nPei Chen served as the Prefectural Administrator of Tongzhou. His second cousin once traveled from Luoyang to Zhengzhou. As evening fell, he heard groans from the roadside. Dismounting, he pushed through the undergrowth and found an ailing crane—its wings drooping, its feathers molting from festering sores. Moved by its cries, he pitied it. Suddenly, an old man in white, leaning on a staff, appeared and said: *\"Young sir, how could you understand compassion for this crane? If you were to apply human blood to its wounds, it would surely fly again.\"* Pei, well-versed in Daoist teachings and of a lofty disposition, immediately replied: *\"I will cut my arm—blood is no difficulty.\"* The old man said: *\"Your resolve is admirable, but it must be the blood of one who has lived three lifetimes...\"*\n\n**Tang**\n...already several hundred years old, he concealed himself and received visitors. He stayed the night, and at midnight, called to his daughter: *\"Bring the crescent moon child.\"* She affixed the moon to the wall—no larger than a sheet of paper. Tang rose and prayed: *\"Tonight we have a guest—grant us light.\"* As soon as he spoke, the room brightened as if candles had been lit. *(Recorded in *The Kettle History*)*\n\n**Master Lu of the Mountain**",

For years, those who encountered him witnessed many strange occurrences. The merchant Zhao Yuanging, a man fond of unusual affairs, sought to travel with him. He frequently purchased Lu’s goods, offered melons and tea, and inquired about his profits. Lu, sensing his intent, said: *\"I see your purpose lies not in trade—what do you seek?\"* Zhao replied: *\"I have heard, venerable one, that you conceal your form and hide your virtue, seeing through the past like a tortoise or a diviner. I humbly beg a single word of guidance.\"*\n\nLu smiled and said: *\"Today shall serve as proof. At noon, the master of this house will face an extraordinary calamity. Someone will intrude with ill intent—warn his wife and children not to respond lightly. Let them shut the door and retreat to the waterside to avoid it. The cost will be no more than three strings and four hundred coins, and no great harm will come. Otherwise, the disaster will be severe. You may go and tell him this directly.\"*\n\nAt the time, Zhao was staying at Zhang’s home. He relayed Lu’s words to Zhang, who, having long known of Lu’s divine nature, promptly shut his door and waited. As noon approached, a pastry-maker arrived, carrying a sack as Lu had described. He knocked, demanding to be let in, and grew furious when no one answered, kicking the door and hurling abuse. A crowd gathered as Zhang and his family slipped out the back gate to avoid him. By noon, the man departed. A few steps later, he suddenly collapsed and died.\n\nAfter some time, the man’s wife arrived, wailing and demanding the authorities be summoned. The official, unable to settle the matter fairly, questioned the onlookers, who all testified to Zhang’s closed-door retreat. The official declared: *\"Zhang bears no guilt.

After twenty years of pursuit, one may change name and appearance, and after another twenty, one’s name may be listed among the earthly immortals. Such tales are often strange indeed.\"\n\nZhao remarked that Lu’s appearance shifted between old and young, and that he was never seen eating or drinking. He also recalled an incident in the market of Fuzhou, where Lu walked with several companions and encountered six or seven men dressed in fine robes, reeking of wine. Lu rebuked them, saying: \"Where are you lot bound? Do you not value your lives?\" Soon after, the six or seven men prostrated themselves in the dust, crying: \"We dare not, we dare not.\" The companions were astonished, but Lu explained: \"These are all river bandits.\" Such were his marvels—clearly one of the Dao-concealed immortals.\n\n**Quan Tongxiu, a friend of Quan Tongxiu:**\nDuring the Yuanhe era, he sat for the imperial examinations but failed. The following year, he traveled among the lakes and seas, where he fell ill and into poverty. A villager hired him as a laborer, and he had already served for a year. While still unwell, the scholar craved sweet bean soup and sent the laborer to buy licorice. The laborer prepared the fire and water but never purchased the herb. Suspecting laziness, the scholar did not press the matter. Suddenly, he saw the laborer break off a small tree branch, rub it in his hands, and hold it near the fire—whereupon it turned into licorice. The laborer then took some sand from the hall, shaped it into beans, and made soup that tasted no different from the real thing. The scholar was astounded.\n\nWhen his illness had somewhat abated, he said to the laborer: \"I have been poor and ill for a long time. Now that I am recovering, I intend to travel elsewhere. I wish to buy some wine and meat to gather the village elders, but I lack the means for provisions.\" The laborer then chopped down a withered mulberry tree, fashioned several baskets of kindling, piled them on a tray, and sprinkled them with water—whereupon they turned into beef. He drew water and transformed it into wine, and when the village elders arrived, all drank and ate their fill. The scholar received thirty bolts of silk as gifts.\n\nHe then addressed the laborer: \"I have been arrogant in my encounter with a Daoist master—my error is grave. Henceforth, I beg to serve you as a disciple.\" The laborer replied: \"In my youth, I made mistakes and became a lowly hireling. My service to you has its term; do not ask me to alter our usual ways, lest I fail in my task.\" Though the scholar agreed, he often hesitated, uneasy with the laborer’s commands. The laborer then took his leave, discoursing on the cycles of life and fortune, and adding that all things in the world could be transformed—except for the red veins in stagnant mud and fallen hair, which no medicine could alter.

Yao, vexed by his son’s refusal to study, daily admonished and reproached him, yet the boy remained idle and undisciplined. Thereupon, Yao built a thatched hut on the southern slope of Mount Tiao, where he secluded his son, cutting off all external affairs so that he might devote himself wholly to learning. The forests and ravines were deep and layered, untouched by the clamor of the world.\n\nOn the day of his son’s departure, Yao warned him: “At each seasonal examination, I shall test your progress. If you fail to improve, I will surely flog you. You must all apply yourselves diligently.” Yet upon arriving in the mountains, the two nephews never once opened a book, busying themselves instead with chopping wood and breaking stones. After several months, the eldest said to them: “The examination period draws near. You have not studied at all—I fear for you.” The two paid no heed, while the eldest studied with great diligence.\n\nOne night, as he sat reading by candlelight at his desk, he felt his fur robe tugged from behind. The collar gradually slipped down, yet he thought nothing of it. He adjusted it, but soon it happened again—several times in succession. Turning to look, he saw a small creature crouched upon his robe, its fur pure white and lustrous as jade. He struck it with his ruler, and the creature shrieked and fled. He called to his two companions, and together they searched the hall with candles, but the doors and windows were tightly sealed, and no trace of the creature could be found.\n\nThe next day, a gray-haired servant arrived on horseback, knocking at the gate. He entered with a staff and addressed the three: “The Lady sends her regards. Last night, her youngest son, in his ignorance, mistakenly crept into your robe. She apologizes for the disturbance. However, your blow injured him severely. He has now recovered—do not worry.” The three bowed in apology, exchanging glances, unable to fathom the matter.\n\nShortly after, the same servant returned, cradling the injured child along with several nursemaids and infants, all clad in fine silk garments of exquisite craftsmanship, unlike anything seen before. He conveyed the Lady’s words: “My son is unharmed, and I bring him to show you.” Upon closer inspection, a red mark like carved cinnabar stretched from his brow to the bridge of his nose—the imprint of the ruler’s strike. The three grew even more alarmed. The servant and nursemaids spoke soothingly to reassure them, adding that the Lady herself would arrive shortly. As soon as she departed, the three resolved to flee in terror and confusion.",

      "translated_text": "Before long, a group of gray-haired servants and dozens of purple-robed palace attendants arrived in haste, bearing before them screens, canopies, and woven mats—all resplendent and gleaming—while an extraordinary fragrance filled the air. Soon after, a lacquered carriage drawn by a black ox with vermilion wheels approached like the wind, escorted by hundreds of fine horses. Upon reaching the gate, the occupant alighted—it was the Lady.\n\nThe three men hurried out to bow twice in greeting. The Lady smiled faintly and said, “I did not expect my son to trouble you so. The injury you inflicted yesterday was no cause for great alarm, but I came to ease your concerns.” She appeared to be around thirty, her bearing graceful and composed, her every movement divine—yet none could tell who she was. She asked the three, “Are you married?” They all replied that they were not. The Lady said, “I have three daughters, each of surpassing beauty and virtue, who would make fitting matches for you three gentlemen.” The three bowed in thanks. The Lady then lingered, ordering separate courtyards built for each of them. In the blink of an eye, painted halls and towering pavilions materialized as if conjured from the clouds.\n\nThe next day, carriages arrived, their wheels rumbling, accompanied by attendants more splendid than those of any noble house. The gleam of their robes and vehicles lit the earth, their fragrance perfuming the mountains and valleys. The three daughters descended from their carriages, each seventeen or eighteen years old. The Lady led them into the hall and invited the three men to take their seats. The feast was lavish, the wine and delicacies beyond anything in the mortal world, many of the fruits unfamiliar. The three men could scarcely believe their fortune. The Lady gestured to her daughters and said, “Each is to be wed to one of you.” They rose from their seats to bow in gratitude. Dozens of maidservants, radiant as immortals, were sent to attend the brides.\n\nThat night, after the wedding rites were completed, the Lady addressed the three men: “What men value most is life, and what they desire most is rank. If you keep this secret for a hundred days, I will grant you longevity beyond this world and positions at the pinnacle of the court.” The three bowed again, though they fretted over their own ignorance and lack of refinement. The Lady reassured them, “Have no fear. I am the sovereign of this earthly realm. I shall summon Confucius.”\n\nIn an instant, Confucius arrived, fully robed and girded with a sword. The Lady stood solemnly and greeted him with a slight bow, then said, “My three sons-in-law wish to study. You shall guide them.” Confucius instructed the three, pointing out the titles of the Six Classics. They understood everything at once, grasping the great principles as if they had long been familiar with them. When he had finished, Confucius took his leave.\n\nThe Lady then summoned the Duke of Zhou, who revealed to them the Mysterious Woman’s military talismans and the secret jade tokens of the *Yuhuang*. The three mastered them without omission. As they sat again, a messenger arrived bearing a letter from Princess Wenle, along with an imperial seal. The letter urged them to strive onward, for the court’s decree had temporarily humbled their lofty aspirations. Upon reaching the capital, they were received by nobles and officials, exchanging only the briefest courtesies before being appointed Grand Masters of the Heir Apparent and enfeoffed as Dukes. When they returned to the mountains, they were made Hanlin Academicians, and poets composed verses to see them off.\n\n---\n\n**Shuoshi of Jingzhou**\nIn Jingzhou, by the Li River, stand two stones resembling gates, called Shuoshi. During the Yonghe era of the Jin, two celestial beings, clad in snow-white robes and caps, alighted upon the stones and rested for ten days before departing. All the locals witnessed this.\n\n**Master Pan of Cao Bridge**\nAt Fuye Abbey in Cao Bridge, Hangzhou, there lived a Master Pan, a man of ample means who embraced generosity and hospitality, aiding others with both deeds and virtue. One day, a youth of striking and uncommon appearance arrived at the abbey and addressed Master Pan: “I have long heard of your virtue and righteousness, of your aid to those in dire straits. I humbly seek refuge in the thatched hut behind your bamboo grove for two months to evade a calamity. May I impose upon your kindness?” He added, “If you grant this request, do not fear I will burden you, nor worry over provisions. I ask only for two *dou* of wine, which will suffice for sixty days.”\n\nThough Master Pan could not fathom the youth’s origins, he gladly agreed upon hearing of his plight. The youth then concealed himself in the thatched hut. No one came searching for him, and he neither ate nor drank. When the sixty days had passed, he emerged to bow in gratitude. Calmly, he asked Master Pan, “Have you received any talismanic scriptures?” Master Pan replied, “I have attained the middle covenant of the *Dongxuan*, though I dare not yet delve into the highest teachings.”\n\nThe youth said, “Your rank is already exalted, but I have received the first stage of the *Zhengyi Jiuzhou Sheling Lu*. I offer it to you in repayment.” He then burned incense before the Heavenly Worthy and transmitted the names of the *Sheling* and the divine officers and generals. At his summons, soldiers and cavalry appeared at once. When the rites were complete, he instructed them, “After this transmission, you shall follow and protect Master Pan as you do me now.” The soldiers then vanished.\n\nThe youth further told Master Pan, “In the main hall, arrange a platform with a bed and altar. Burn incense, sit in reverence, and you will know all matters of good and ill within the Nine Provinces and beyond. But do not defile it with blood or meat, lest you incur unseen retribution. If you maintain purity and caution, you may attain the immortality of the divine transcendents.” With that, he vanished, and none knew where he had gone.",

      "translated_text": "Pan then arranged a couch and a low table, sitting reverently in the central hall. In an instant, he knew all matters great and small within the Four Seas. For ten days thus, the divine officers relayed reports, their messages incessant and clamorous. Pan grew indignant and said, “I am but a man of leisure. Why must I know the affairs of distant lands?” He strictly forbade the divine officers from delivering reports. They replied, “Our duties may not be neglected.” As the reports grew more frequent and his prohibitions went unheeded, Pan resorted to eating meat and garlic to repel them. After three to five days, the voices of the reports gradually receded, and the divine officers no longer came—vanishing entirely.\n\nOne evening, the youth reappeared and said, “I lightly transmitted the true formula and have thus incurred punishment. You have defiled the divine numen, and your offense warrants dark torment. Yet, mindful of our past forbearance, I cannot stand by and watch you fall. Seek another guardian, broadly perform hidden merits, and relieve the suffering of others to atone for your transgressions. Otherwise, you shall descend into the nether prison.” After consuming meat and garlic, Pan had known he had erred, and upon hearing these words, he was filled with extraordinary dread.\n\nThe youth then took rice crumbs and molded them into human figures, each four or five inches tall, placing them in a wall niche. He also bestowed two jade talismans upon Pan, admonishing him, “When those afflicted by suffering or calamity come seeking aid, consult the powder figures to discern the source of their misfortune, then use my talismans to save them. Do not accept money; your duty lies in accumulating merit to atone for your faults. Persevere without fail, and in ten years, I shall return.” Thereafter, Pan used cinnabar talismans to rescue others, dispelling disasters and curing illnesses. Those who sought him came like a throng to a marketplace.\n\nOver ten years later, the youth reappeared, staying for over a month. He spoke at length of matters beyond the heavens before taking his leave. A year later, Pan passed away without illness, leading others to suspect he had attained the Dao of *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\n---\n\n**Minister Lu Jun**\nMinister Lu Jun passed the imperial examination and served as a gentleman of the Ministry of Works. Due to illness, he requested to be appointed prefect of Junzhou. Upon arriving in the prefecture, his condition worsened, leaving him emaciated yet still able to receive visitors. He often retreated to a mountain studio behind the prefectural hall to cultivate his nature in solitude. His attendants kept their distance, and none dared approach without summons.\n\nSuddenly, a man in tattered clothing climbed over the wall and entered. Lu invited him in, and the man gave his surname as Wang. Asked of his origins, he replied he had come from the mountains. Lu smiled and said, “So you are Master Wang of the mountains. What instruction do you bring?” Wang replied, “Your Excellency holds the highest rank among men, yet your lifespan is not long, and misfortune now befalls you. This has brought lingering illness, which is why I come to your aid.”\n\nNoting the lack of water in the studio, Lu intended to summon servants to fetch tea, but Wang stopped him. Drawing water from the well with his sash, he dissolved a cinnabar pellet in it, wrung out the sash, and had Lu swallow the liquid. He then made an agreement: “In five days, your illness will be cured, and your health will surpass your former state. After three years, you will face a great trial. Diligently perform hidden merits, and take compassion for others as your intent. I shall return then, and we will meet at the beginning of summer.”\n\nThereafter, Lu’s illness improved, and within ten days, he fully recovered. The following year, he resigned his post and returned to the capital, where he was appointed vice-director of the Bureau of Iron and Salt. In the fourth month of summer, as he walked along the eastern road outside his office, he suddenly saw the mountain man arrive at his residence. The man rejoiced and said, “This year marks the end of your second life limit, and the calamity was severe. However, while in the prefecture last year, you exonerated a wrongful conviction and saved three lives, thereby averting the disaster. You will only face three to five days of discomfort this month, but there is no cause for concern.”\n\nThe next day, the mountain man sent two servants with ten thousand coins to distribute among the poor and sick at Gouji Slope. He then departed, saying, “On the fifth day of the fifth month, twenty-three years hence, at noon, have a Daoist await me atop Wanshan Peak. By then, you will govern Hanzhong, and I shall bestow upon you the Elixir of Golden Radiance. Do not miss the appointed time.”\n\nThereafter, Lu held a succession of esteemed posts, rising in prominence and favor. Later, he was appointed military governor of Hanzhong, and twenty-three years had passed. At the appointed time, he sent the Daoist Niu Zhiwei to ascend Wanshan Peak at noon on the fifth day. The mountain man was already there. He gave Niu two golden elixir pellets to swallow, saying, “You possess the qi of the Dao but lack hidden merits and have not yet attained the rank of the Dao. You must cultivate further.” He then presented Lu with ten golden elixir pellets, saying, “You shall enjoy a long life. Do not cease your cultivation. When your worldly limit is complete, I await your return to Penglai Palace.” He bowed to Niu and took his leave, vanishing without a trace.\n\nLater, Niu lived to over eighty, yet his appearance remained as that of a man in his thirties. Minister Lu lived to nearly ninety, his senses sharp and his vitality unwaning. After his passing, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room.\n\n---\n\n**Li Gongzuo**\nAfter passing the imperial examination, Li Gongzuo served as an aide in Zhongling. He had a servant who, though a commoner, had diligently and reverently served him day and night for nearly thirty years. Gongzuo never suspected he was an extraordinary person. One day, the servant announced his departure, leaving behind a poem:\n\n*I possess a pearl within my robe,*\n*Unmindful of the dust upon it.*\n*I hold the principle of long life,*\n*Unwearied by this mortal form.*\n*The Jiangnan is a cave of immortals,*\n*Where I shall merge with the true.*\n*Unashamed of the marketplace’s clamor,*\n*I come to save the people of the world.*\n*Su Dan’s traces are long past,*\n*(Note: Su Dan is meant.)*\n*The ignorant may yet be befriended.*\n*(Gongzuo’s courtesy name was “The Ignorant.”)*\n*Do not speak of the Eastern Sea’s transformation,*\n*For heaven and earth know eternal spring.*\n\nAfter this, he departed, and no one knew where he had gone.

      "translated_text": "Wang Zizhi, styled Xianmiao, claimed to be a native of Houshi in Henan. He often traveled between the capital and Luoyang. Elders said that for fifty years they had seen him, his appearance ever like that of a man in his forties, none knowing his true age. He cultivated qi and was fond of wine.\n\nIn the early years of Pu Prefecture’s Lord Langya Chongying’s governorship, Xianmiao arrived at the Purple Ultimate Palace. The prefect, Wang, treated him with great generosity and, learning of his love for wine, daily sent him two flasks. One day, as Xianmiao was leaving, he encountered a woodcutter at the palace gate, carrying firewood on his shoulder. The man’s appearance was extraordinary, and Xianmiao found him most unusual. He purchased the woodcutter’s firewood, paying him generously, and the woodcutter accepted the silver without demur and departed. Xianmiao sent someone to follow him and inquire. The woodcutter went straight to a tavern, drank all the wine he could, and then returned home.\n\nThe next day, the woodcutter returned and said to Xianmiao, “This wine is indeed fine, but it cannot compare to the brew of the Shi family in Jie County. I have just come from there and regret that I had no companion before to share it fully.” Xianmiao descended the steps, took his hand, and sat with him by the brazier. He entreated the woodcutter, saying, “Can the Shi family’s fragrant wine be obtained?” The woodcutter was pleased and wrote a vermilion talisman with cinnabar, placing it in the fire. Before the smoke had dissipated, a young servant appeared. The woodcutter commanded him, saying, “You, take the master’s servant and these two flasks, go to the Shi household, and fetch wine. I shall wait to drink with the master until we are drunk.” It was already deep night, and the gates were barred. The young servant said to Xianmiao’s servant, “Close your eyes.” He then lifted the servant’s head, and man and wine jars slipped through the gate’s crack. In an instant, they reached Jie County, purchased the wine, and returned. They poured it together, and its sweetness, richness, and potency were beyond anything in the mortal world.\n\nAt midnight, the woodcutter said to Xianmiao, “You are drunk. Shall I summon a guest to accompany you in drinking?” Xianmiao replied, “Very well.” The woodcutter again wrote a vermilion talisman and placed it in the fire. In the blink of an eye, a strange fragrance filled the room. A man of imposing presence entered, his brows and temples handsome, clad in purple robes, holding a tablet. He bowed and sat. The woodcutter said, “Be seated.” They drank deeply in turn, and the two flasks were soon emptied. The woodcutter heated an iron poker and warmed the purple-robed man, saying, “You may go.” By then, dawn was breaking in the east. They each took their leave, and the woodcutter said to Xianmiao, “Do you recognize the man who just left? In a little while, go to the Heze Temple and you will see him.” Xianmiao saw the woodcutter off, then visited the temple.

      "translated_text": "Officer Xue\n\nOfficer Xue once journeyed with his friend Li to the capital, both sharing the same resolve to seek the Dao. Together they wandered through famous mountains for years, yet met with no success. Later, Xue headed south into the Five Ridges, declaring his intent to seclude himself on Mount Luofu, his determination growing ever more steadfast. Li, however, turned back midway and returned to the capital, where his official career proved ill-fated. As old age pressed upon him, he and Xue had been parted for over thirty years, their bond of friendship and kinship long faded. In his later years, leaning on a staff, Li made his way to Mount Luofu to seek him out—and indeed, the two were reunited.\n\nBy then, Xue had dwelled there for many years, his Daoist arts perfected. His bearing was refined and elegant, his skin smooth as jade. Amid the mountain’s peaks stood pavilions and terraces, wind-swept kiosks and moonlit pavilions—all unlike anything found in the mortal world. Seeing Li’s emaciated and withered appearance, Xue was deeply moved with pity. He said, “Though you wish to stay here, you cannot remain for long.” He then gave Li a generous gift of gold and treasures, and ordered his female musicians to hold a feast in his honor.\n\nAs Li was about to depart, Xue noticed his teeth were all missing. When asked the reason, Li explained, “Previously, while playing with a ball, I damaged them. I kept the broken teeth in my sash.” He took them out for Xue to examine. Xue had the female musicians clean off the grime, then used a small knife to scrape the broken edges before reattaching two teeth. He sent Li on his way with a warning not to speak of it. By the time Li reached the foot of the mountain, the teeth had already firmly set. Over the next ten years, all of Li’s other teeth rotted and fell out, yet the two that had been restored remained firmly in place, unchanged.\n\nMaster Rong, a teacher surnamed Zhang, had been appointed from the position of *Geishizhong* to govern this region. After more than a year, he fell gravely ill from miasmic vapors, his condition worsening month by month. A devotee of Buddhism, he placed no trust in talismans or medicines, even when others claimed they were effective. His family, retainers, and officers were deeply concerned. Vice-Commissioner Feng, the Master of Xindu, secretly told one of Zhang’s close attendants, “Officer Xue of Mount Luofu possesses profound Daoist arts and has relieved many of their suffering. People near and far rely on him. You should send a messenger bearing a token of sincerity to seek his aid.”\n\nThus, a messenger was dispatched to find him, and his dwelling was indeed located. Upon hearing the request, Xue took pity and said to the messenger, “Convey my thanks to Prefect Zhang for sending gifts from afar to this mountain retreat. I have no paper or brush here, so I cannot send a letter in reply. As for his illness, there is no need for concern. Once the messenger arrives, have them sweep and purify the courtyard and maintain a strict fast for three days—there will naturally be a response.”\n\nFollowing his instructions, on the third day, the entire residence was filled with a strange and fragrant aroma, though nothing else was seen. Yet Prefect Zhang’s illness was cured. Another messenger was sent bearing gifts and silk to express gratitude, but this time, the envoy lost the path and could never again find the place.\n\nThis was surely one of the ranks of earthbound immortals.

      "translated_text": "She Fan\n\nShe Fan was a native of Shu. From childhood, he was drawn to the Dao, and once formed a bond with three like-minded companions, swearing brotherhood. Together, they roamed the mountains, gathering esoteric arts. At the gates of Mount Emei, they made a pact: “This mountain is the abode of immortals—there must be places here where the Dao may be sought. Let us three part ways, each entering a different valley, to see if any of us encounters anything.”\n\nThey separated, and Fan entered the Valley of Wooden Bark. After five or six *li*, he came upon four old men seated on a great boulder, a large platter of simmering meat before them as they ate. They beckoned Fan to sit and offered him a portion. Fan declined, saying, “I seek the Dao of immortals and have long since renounced meat and blood—this is no affectation.”\n\nThe old men smiled and said, “Since you seek the Dao, enter this valley, and you will surely find what you seek.”\n\nFan proceeded into the valley. After several dozen *li*, he saw pavilions and terraces of such splendor that they could not have been of this world. At the gate stood several Daoists, who asked how he had come there. He recounted his journey in full. One of them studied Fan intently for a long while, then led him to a great hall where statues stood in solemn array. Before the image of the Heavenly Worthy lay stacks of scriptures upon the table. The Daoist told Fan to close his eyes, reach out at random, and take one volume. He then handed it to him, saying, “This is the *Celestial Script in Great Seal Script*. Practicing it will grant you longevity and transcendence, allow you to accumulate merit and save others. But this is not a place for you to linger—you must go now.”\n\nFan took leave of the Daoists, departed the mountain with the scripture, and lodged at a household near the valley’s entrance. There, a child had fallen into boiling water, his flesh scalded in several places. The entire household was in distress, with no means of saving him. Fan consulted the *Celestial Script* and found a passage marked for such treatment. He transcribed the characters, mixed the ashes with water, and washed the child’s wounds—by the time he had finished, the child was fully healed.\n\nFrom then on, Fan often used the *Celestial Script* to perform hidden acts of merit and save others. Those who benefited from his powers were beyond counting. When Lord Bin, the Military Commissioner, governed Chengdu, he summoned Fan to his service and treated him with exceptional courtesy. When the lord later journeyed to the capital for an audience, Fan accompanied him to Chang’an.\n\nOne day, a member of Lord Bin’s family fell gravely ill. Physicians filled the house, but none could effect a cure. The lord suddenly recalled Fan’s divine script, and hastily summoned him. Fan arrived, took up his brush, and wrote the characters—no sooner had he finished than the patient recovered. Gold and silk were offered as gifts, amounting to tens of thousands, but Fan accepted nothing.\n\nLater, he returned to Shu and wandered among the mountains, vanishing without a trace.\n\n---\n\nZheng Youxuan\n\nZheng Youxuan was the scion of a noble family in Chang’an. As a boy, he studied alongside a neighbor’s son, Wenqiu, under the same master. Youxuan was proud and blunt, considering his lineage pure and exalted, while Wenqiu was of humble birth. Often, he mocked and berated him, saying, “You are no kin to me—how dare you study at my side? Even if I say nothing, do you feel no shame?”\n\nWenqiu’s face darkened with resentment, and within a year, he died.\n\nA decade later, Youxuan passed the imperial examinations with distinction and was appointed as a military advisor in Shuzhou. Upon taking office, the prefect ordered him to serve as a magistrate in Tangxing. Among his colleagues was a young man named Qiu, the son of a wealthy merchant, who had just come of age. His family’s wealth was vast, and he often feasted and roamed with Youxuan, showering him with gold and gifts. Yet Youxuan, considering Qiu beneath his station, never treated him with proper courtesy.\n\nOne day, Youxuan hosted a grand banquet but did not invite Qiu. As the feast drew to a close, someone said to Youxuan, “Qiu shares your office—why was he not invited? Has he committed some offense?”\n\nYouxuan hesitated, then summoned Qiu. When he arrived, Youxuan handed him a goblet, but Qiu declined, saying he could not drink it all. Youxuan grew furious and cursed him: “You lowborn cur, fit only for counting coins—how dare you presume to hold office? That I even deign to associate with you is your good fortune—how dare you refuse my wine!”\n\nHe rose in a huff, and Qiu, his face flushed with anger, withdrew. He resigned his post, shut himself away, and within a month, died of illness.\n\nThe following year, Youxuan’s term ended, and he took up residence in Mengyang, where he developed an interest in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Hearing of a certain Master Wu in the mountains of Shu, Youxuan admired his reputation and sought him out, wishing to become his disciple. He remained with the master for nearly a decade but received no transmission of teachings. Growing restless, he took his leave and returned.\n\nLater, while passing through Chang’an, he lodged in Baocheng. At the inn, he met a boy of ten or so, fair and quick-witted. Youxuan spoke with him, and the boy’s wit and eloquence astonished him. The boy said, “You and I have been old acquaintances for years—do you not remember?”\n\nYouxuan replied, “I have forgotten.”\n\nThe boy said, “I was once Wenqiu, living in Chang’an. You studied with me but deemed me unworthy, insulting and humiliating me. Later, I was reborn as Qiu, the son of a merchant family, and served as a magistrate in Tangxing. You accepted my generous gifts yet called me a ‘lowborn cur.’ How could you be so arrogant? You, born to a family of scholars, trampled upon others—was that the Way?”\n\n“I am a Perfected One of the Great Clarity.”",

Yet you were reckless, haughty, and arrogant—thus you could never attain the Way. Alas, how lamentable! With these words, he suddenly vanished.\n\nYouxuan, awakening to his sins, fell gravely ill and soon perished.\n\n---\n\n**Lu Daoliu**\nLu Daoliu was a man of unknown origins. At over seventy years of age, he told fortunes in the markets of Luoyang. One day, he fell severely ill for more than ten days, his condition growing perilous. Hearing that the recluse Cheng Xiuyi often traveled between the two capitals and had performed many wondrous deeds—being one who had attained the Dao—Lu informed him of his illness. Cheng took from his gourd a cinnabar pellet, fine as a mustard seed, and ground it in a white porcelain bowl with a few drops of wine. He then inscribed the characters for \"Two Celestial Envoys\" inside the bowl and gave it to Lu to drink with the wine. Lu’s illness immediately vanished.\n\nShortly after, as Lu was returning from Xuan Yuan Temple and nearing the city, he passed by the Valley River. The heat was oppressive, so he bathed in the water. Suddenly, the river surged, its crest rising over ten feet. Lu was swept away more than a hundred paces before two Celestial Envoys appeared on the bank, urging melon farmers to wade in and rescue him. He was barely saved. Upon reaching the shore, the two envoys vanished. It was the inscribed characters of the \"Two Celestial Envoys\" that had secretly delivered him from this calamity.\n\nDuring the Tianfu era, Cheng arrived in Chang’an and told others, “The Five Ridges are a refuge from the world.” Claiming to seek cinnabar, he entered Guiyang and was never heard from again.\n\n---\n\n**Cheng Sheng**\nCheng Sheng came from an immensely wealthy family that had long resided in Lingkou. Among his uncles, the seventh was devoted to the Dao. In his early years, he donned hempen robes and wandered the Huayin Mountains, returning home only occasionally. After the Xiantong era, his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nWhen the great famine breached the passes and Emperor Zhaozong fled in distress, Cheng Sheng’s family was scattered, and his livelihood reduced to poverty. One day, his uncle unexpectedly returned home, moved by pity and sorrow. He stayed for several days before taking Cheng Sheng’s son to the Sand Gardens of Tongzhou.\n\nUpon arriving at his dwelling—a grand estate with towering pavilions and gates resembling a palace—he left the boy outside. After a long while, he returned with a bundle of clothing and utensils, which he gave to the boy to take home for his family’s support. Upon opening it, they found tens of thousands of gold coins. Cheng Sheng was astonished, realizing his uncle had attained the Dao.\n\nThe next day, he and his son returned to search for him, but his whereabouts were unknown. From then on, Cheng Sheng’s family was well provided for.\n\nOutside the gate, a stone chime had stood for fifty or sixty years, serving as a barrier for carriages and horses.

The next morning, as he held court in the Zichen Hall, his chief ministers Yao Chong and Song Jing entered to present state affairs. The emperor sat in silence, as if he had not heard them. The two ministers grew alarmed and repeated their report. The emperor rose, descended the steps, and gazed at the officials assembled in the courtyard, yet paid them no heed. The ministers, now deeply fearful, withdrew.\n\nThe eunuch Gao Lishi then addressed the emperor: *\"The chief ministers have matters to present. Should Your Majesty not grant them an audience? The matters they raised earlier concern the very security of the state, yet you ignored them.

The courtesan, surnamed Zhang and known as \"First,\" sensed that Yang’s downfall was imminent and soon abandoned him to flee with Jing. Together they departed the Western Capital, bound for Taiyuan. At an inn in Lingshi, they dismounted to rest, where they encountered the Bearded Guest. He was a man of imposing stature, with a fiery red beard, and he arrived clad in tattered robes, riding a lame donkey. He tossed his cloth sack to the ground, took out a pillow, and lay down outside, watching as Zhang combed her hair, which cascaded to the floor. She stood brushing it by the bed. Jing, observing the bearded man, grew furious and could not help but glare at him. Zhang, studying the stranger’s face intently, held her hair with one hand while shielding herself with the other, signaling Jing to suppress his anger. Once she had hastily finished combing her hair, she straightened her robes and stepped forward to ask his surname. The man outside replied, \"Zhang.\" She said, \"I, too, am surnamed Zhang—we must be sisters.\" She promptly bowed to him. \"What is your birth order?\" she asked. \"Third,\" he replied. \"And yours?\" \"I am the eldest,\" she said. Delighted, he exclaimed, \"Today I am fortunate to meet a younger sister!\" Zhang called out to Jing from a distance, \"Master Li, come and pay respects to Third Brother.\" Jing thus bowed to him.

Can you arrange a meeting, Master Li?\" Jing replied, \"My friend Liu Wenjing is very close to him—he can certainly arrange it.\" The guest observed the qi and said, \"Let me visit him.\" They set a date to meet at Fenyang Bridge.\n\nWhen the day came, the guest arrived as promised. Jing told Wenjing, \"I have a skilled physiognomist who wishes to meet you. May I bring him here?\" Wenjing, who had long admired the young man and was considering supporting him, immediately prepared wine to welcome them. Together, they met the Crown Prince. He arrived without formal robes or shoes, dressed in a coarse fur coat, his spirit soaring, utterly unlike an ordinary man. The guest saw him and fell silent, taking the lowest seat, his qi drained and spirit crushed. After a few cups of wine, he beckoned Jing and said, \"This is truly the Son of Heaven.\" Jing relayed this to Liu, who rejoiced even more.\n\nAfter they left, Hongxu said, \"I saw him and confirmed eight or nine parts of it, but we must also have Dao-Brother see him.\" He then arranged for Jing and his sister to meet at the Horse Market’s eastern wine tower in the capital. When they arrived, they ascended the tower and saw Hongxu drinking with a Daoist. They all sat together, and Hongxu proposed that the Daoist accompany them to Taiyuan. The Daoist played chess with Liu Wenjing while Hongxu and Jing joined them. The Prince arrived, his brilliance striking, and with a deep bow, he took his seat. His spirit was clear, his qi refreshing, filling the room with vitality, his presence majestic. At first sight, the Daoist paled and dropped his chess piece, saying, \"This game is lost. To lose here is extraordinary! There is no way to salvage it—what more can be said?\" After the game ended, he stepped outside and told Hongxu, \"This world is not yours. Seek another realm. Take heart and do not dwell on it.\"\n\nThey returned to the capital together. Hongxu instructed his wife and sister to meet Master Li. His wife, too, was a celestial being. Hongxu arrived in a gauze turban and coarse fur coat, carrying a slingshot. They entered the main hall, where music and revelry filled the air. Over thirty female musicians played, a spectacle not even found in the households of kings and marquises, as if a gathering in a cave heaven. Then, twenty beds were brought in, covered with embroidered quilts. Hongxu removed the quilts and said, \"These are merely ledgers and keys. They contain treasures, coins, and goods—all of which I now gift to you. I had intended to seek opportunities in the Central Plains, perhaps enduring a few years of dragon-like strife, using these as funds. But now that there is a true lord, what need is there? The Li family of Taiyuan is a true hero. Within three to five years, there will be great peace. Master Li’s sister is well-suited to assist him—none but she can aid such a wise ruler. Take heed!\"\n\n\"Ten years from now, thousands of miles to the southeast, something extraordinary will occur—that will be my time to serve. When you hear of it, secretly celebrate with wine.\" He then summoned over a hundred servants to bow, saying, \"Master Li’s sister is your new mistress.\" With that, he and his wife mounted horses in military attire and departed. The Daoist, too, vanished without a trace.\n\nJing, inspired by these events, devoted himself to aiding the Prince, helping to forge a great enterprise. During the Zhenguan era, a report came from the southeastern barbarians: a sea pirate with a thousand ships and over a hundred thousand soldiers had seized Fuyu, killed its ruler, and declared himself king. The land was now at peace. Jing, knowing Hongxu had succeeded, told his wife and poured wine toward the southeast in celebration. Thus, it was clear that the rise of a true ruler was ordained by Heaven—how could mediocre men dare to recklessly plot rebellion?\n\n---\n\nThe Dongming Oil Merchant\n\nThe Dongming Oil Merchant, whose name is unknown, often carried his load to sell oil in the nearby wards.

Otherwise, he would be imprisoned, leaving his family of several with nothing to eat, surely leading to their ruin. His clan gathered, weeping as they prepared to part.

He then went to Jingyun Abbey in Fengyi Ward, where a solitary courtyard was available for a monthly rent of five hundred *wen*. He stabled his horse and settled in.\n\nNearby lived an old man with thick brows and a broad forehead, his beard and temples snowy white. His face bore an ancient yet refined air.

I will only be here for two or three days, while you have occupied this room for over twenty.\" The old man replied, \"I have heard of this place before, but it is difficult to lodge here for long, even for a gentleman paying monthly rent.\" Wang Lin insisted he stay, and the old man agreed, ascending the steps with evident pleasure. He opened the door, drew water, and entered, then shut the gate and remained silent.\n\nIt was the eighth month. The old man had already kindled a charcoal fire in a ground stove and sat wrapped in its warmth.

I often visit the markets and no longer bother with cooking fires.\" After more than ten days, Wang Lin suspected the old man possessed the Dao and began to treat him with reverence and intimacy. Sometimes he would sit by the stove and converse with him. The old man’s words were lofty and profound, far beyond those of ordinary men. Gradually, Wang Lin confided his feelings and sought to learn from him. But when dawn came, the old man departed and did not return by evening.

      "translated_text": "The abbot of Mount Zhongshan had begun constructing a sutra tower, planning four stories. No sooner had the first level been completed than a million in funds had already been expended. As the project stalled, no progress was made, and the abbot’s sighs of distress and anxiety showed plainly in his words and expression.\n\nAmong the kitchen workers was a monk of humble and rustic bearing, ordinarily tasked with nothing more than gathering firewood and drawing water. No one knew his origins. One day, he suddenly approached the abbot and said, “This matter is beyond your understanding. Leave it be and do not inquire further.” Several days later, he spoke again, only to be rebuffed as before. This happened three times in all. The abbot, suspecting something unusual, gently asked his intent.\n\nThe monk replied, “This humble monk possesses a method of transmutation. I wish to help the master complete this great work.” When asked what he required, he said, “Only twenty thousand cash to procure the necessary ingredients—enough to accomplish the task.” Though the abbot found his words strange and suspected deceit, he nonetheless sent someone to provide the money for the purchase.\n\nThe monk immediately dispatched another monk to buy the materials. They obtained twenty *jin* of mercury, and with the remaining funds, purchased various minerals and herbs, returning by evening. In a small room beside the kitchen, he dug a furnace in the earth, sealing it meticulously. He spread three *sheng* of ash beneath it, poured the mercury into the ash, and took a small measure of powdered medicine from his sash, sprinkling it into the mixture. Covering it with an oil-paper sheet, he piled over a hundred *jin* of charcoal atop it and kindled a fierce fire to refine it.\n\nFrom night until dawn, the fire burned away, leaving behind a massive cake of pure gold, its luster extraordinary. The monk said, “Take this to the market and sell it to merchants at twenty strings of cash per *liang*.” Following his instructions, the abbot sold the gold, purchased materials, and hired workers—whereupon the tower was swiftly completed.",

      "translated_text": "One day, Zhao suddenly fixed his gaze upon Ren’s face and said in alarm, “Your spirit and form have changed—you are destined for execution in the marketplace. You should not remain here any longer. You have often seen the workings of the furnace and crucible—can you remember them?” Ren replied, “I have not received your instruction, Master, and dare not secretly commit them to memory.” Zhao then took out his medicines and minerals, showing them to Ren one by one, teaching him orally and demonstrating with his hands how to transmute tin into silver. He warned him, “Do not wear silk or brocade, do not indulge in extravagance, do not glut yourself on wine and meat, do not indulge in lust, do not ride in silver-trimmed carriages, do not seek official rank or fame. Your clothing and food have always been plain and meager, your fate lowly and humble. I provide only enough to sustain you. You must serve as a bondsman for twenty years, cultivating frugality and diligence, content with toil. The slightest lapse in restraint will surely bring you to execution. Be warned, be cautious.” Soon after, Zhao took leave of Ren’s family and arranged for him to serve as a bondsman under the younger brother of Officer Duan, where he remained for ten years. His conduct and integrity surpassed that of ordinary servants. Before long, Duan’s brother departed for the capital and, trusting in Ren’s honesty and prudence, left him in charge of the household. Later, when Ren transmuted silver and spent beyond his means, the master and his concubine berated him relentlessly. Unable to endure their abuse, he seized a knife and killed them. Arrested and interrogated under torture, he was to be sentenced to the harshest penalty. When the magistrate inquired into the full account of the matter, Ren recounted all that had transpired. Testing his transmutation of tin, they found it to be true. Ren wept and said, “I violated the Master’s warnings and ensnared myself in the net of punishment. Had I endured for twenty years, I would have escaped this calamity.” In the end, he was executed.\n\nThe arts of alchemy—whether transmuting base metals into gold or silver—are not to be recklessly pursued by ordinary men. Those who obtain such knowledge often invite disaster, as verified by countless examples from ancient times to the present. Those who aspire to the Dao should take heed.\n\n**The Girl of Qiyang**\nThere was a girl from Qiyang, five or six years of age, whose family sold wine. One day, in the depths of winter’s bitter cold, a dozen woodcutters gathered firewood in the market before gradually dispersing. Only an old man remained, his load of firewood unsold as dusk approached, the north wind growing fiercer. The girl’s mother, moved by pity, called to him and bought his firewood for a hundred coins, offering him a meal. The old man said, “No need for food.” He handed her a vessel of wine, and from his sleeve a persimmon fell. The girl picked it up. The old man smiled and said, “I had meant to take it home, but since you, child, have found it, you may eat it.” The girl then gazed at the persimmon and, from that moment, ate nothing else. Several years passed, and her appearance became extraordinarily lovely. As for the woodcutter, none knew where he had gone.\n\n*Record of Divine Immortals’ Encounters, Scroll Four—End*",

During the Xiantong era, as he prepared to ascend the hall at dawn to light incense, he suddenly saw a Daoist who turned to him and said, “There is a wondrous realm—would you care to visit?” Huaiyi agreed, and together they entered the mountains. Flowers and trees flourished in lush abundance; waters and rocks held serene beauty. At times, towering peaks touched the heavens, with ancient pines lining the path; at others, jade towers blotted out the sun, and tiered cities clung to the void. The marvels he beheld defied description. After some time, he grew hungry, and the Daoist already knew. He said, “Here grows a celestial peach, bearing fruit but once in a thousand years—it will cure your hunger.” He handed Huaiyi a peach, large as a two-*sheng* vessel, its fragrance and flavor unmatched in the mortal world. After eating, they continued their journey. At times, he walked upon water without wetting his feet; at others, he soared through the air without obstruction. Now he stood atop the clouds, now he waved his sleeves in the empty sky; now he gazed down at the sun and moon, now he peered below at the Milky Way. Thus they returned to the human realm after a full year had passed. From that time on, Huaiyi ate no more. He wandered among men, spoke of his experience to his parents, and thereafter entered the Dao. He sought out immortals, explored sacred marvels, and departed, never to return.\n\nDu Huai, in his youth, encountered a Daoist on Mount Changbai. The Daoist, seeing his many ailments, gave him a grain of cinnabar, large as a *zuan* bean, its red light radiant and translucent, and bade him swallow it. “This elixir not only dispels cold accumulations,” he said, “but if you abstain from meat, it may grant you long life. Beware of defilement.” After taking the pill, Du’s complexion grew full and joyful, his body light and vigorous, and he no longer needed to eat. He rose through the ranks to become Prefect of Shangzhou. For thirty years, he abstained from grain, a fact unknown to others. He said, “My immortal master warned me against eating meat. Now, wishing to cease all grain, I must first eat meat—but that will surely rob me of the elixir’s power.” So he ate a small portion of meat. After a long while, he vomited an object the size of a chicken’s egg, soft and sticky like fresh glue. Cutting it open, he found the cinnabar within, its light and color as bright as when he first took it. He tried to swallow it again, but it slipped away. He lamented the loss for a long time. That night, he dreamed of the Daoist from Mount Changbai, who said, “You failed to keep my precept and forfeited long life. I have reclaimed the elixir.” At the time, Du was over eighty years old, yet appeared no older than forty. After losing the elixir, within ten days his teeth and hair aged, his complexion withered, and within a few years, he died.",

      "translated_text": "Wu Dan Cu\n\nWu Dan Cu was a native of Pingyuan Township in Fengtian, Jingzhao. During the Xiantong era, as drought and famine struck the capital region, he took his wife and two children westward to seek sustenance. Arriving in Yongshou County, he joined an old man to reap wheat. The old man led him deep into the western mountains, journeying over ten *li*. Suddenly, a violent thunderstorm erupted. Once the skies cleared, they gradually approached the old man’s estate. Its gates and courtyards were solemn and immaculate, resembling an official residence.\n\nThe old man prepared a meal for Wu and slowly explained, “I am surnamed Han. I cultivate the Dao here. Generally, in Daoist practice, if one owes even the slightest debt to another, one cannot ascend to heaven. I once borrowed money from you—a sum of five hundred thousand coins—and had not yet repaid it before your distant journey. Now, I wish to settle this debt.”\n\nAfter the meal, the old man sent a village boy to guide Wu out of the mountain gate, instructing him, “You may await me in Jingzhou. As for the debt in Yongshou, I shall first provide five hundred thousand coins for your travel provisions.”\n\nUpon parting, after walking a hundred paces, Wu emerged from what seemed like a mist and found himself back in Yongshou’s marketplace. He then traveled to Jingzhou and took up residence there. That night, he dreamed of Master Han, who said, “The money lies beneath your bed. You may take and use it.” The next day, he found five hundred thousand coins under his bed. From then on, his enterprises prospered, and his resources became abundant.\n\nThough his fellow villagers later learned of a Daoist cultivator named Han in the mountains, they could not recall his given name. When they returned to search for the estate, they could no longer find its location.\n\n---\n\nWang Kuo\n\nThe commoner Wang Kuo, during the Xiantong era, boarded a boat at Kezhu to cross Dongting Lake. A fierce wind arose, forcing the vessel to moor at the foot of Jun Mountain. Wang and several companions disembarked to explore the mountain paths. As they ascended, they suddenly caught the scent of wine. When Wang asked his companions, none detected it. The fragrance grew stronger, and soon they spotted a cave in the mountainside. Suspicious, Wang entered the cavern. After ten paces, he found a depression in the flat stone, filled with wine. He scooped some and drank—its flavor was rich and exquisite. After consuming half a *dou* or more, he grew pleasantly intoxicated. Resting beside the depression, he dozed until he partially sobered, then returned to the boat.\n\nWhen he recounted the tale to his fellow travelers, they rushed to seek the cave but found nothing. From that day, Wang felt invigorated and free of illness. Gradually, he lost his taste for grains and entered the famous mountains to study the Dao. Later, he came across a scripture stating, “On Jun Mountain lies celestial wine; those who drink it ascend as immortals.” The wine Wang encountered was indeed this divine brew.\n\n---\n\nDuke Gao Pian of Yan\n\nThe Chancellor, Duke Gao Pian of Yan...",

      "translated_text": "In the third year of Qianfu, the bing-shen year (876), during the eighth month, Duke Gao Pian of Yan began constructing the outer city walls and fortified gates to repel enemies, spanning thirty-two *li*. Starting from the northwest, he excavated the earth to channel the waters of the Qingyuan River southeastward, where it converged with the Qingcheng River. He then dug a moat along the southwest, extending from south of the Xian Gate to the front of the Ganting Temple, where it met the great river, encircling the city for defense. For the rammed-earth construction, he mobilized labor from the counties of Peng, Mei, Jia, Shu, Zi, Jian, Na, Han, Huan, and the capital’s outskirts—ten counties in all—assigning workers to measure and set the frames. The project was completed in sixty days.\n\nMagistrate Chen Zhao of Linnan County oversaw the efforts of seven counties, which were allocated sections including Jinhua Street and the former site of Sima Xiangru’s Qin Terrace. In total, seven terraces were built, each over a *zhang* in height, with the central terrace being the largest. The earth was entirely excavated from these sites, and beneath them, a new moat was dredged, over twenty *chi* deep. At its base lay stone slabs, three to four *chi* wide, five to six *chi* long, and over a *chi* thick, stacked in pairs for sturdy reinforcement. As the laborers lifted the stones, a five-colored smoke and flame suddenly rose three *chi* high from the pit. Within the stone cavity, they discovered a square stone box, over five *cun* in size, its surface gleaming with golden radiance as if freshly painted. Inside the box lay a silver gourd, the size of a finger. The workers scrambled to seize it, fighting and grappling, and though Chen Zhao attempted to restrain them, he could not. He reported the incident to Duke Gao.\n\nDuke Gao dispatched Hou Qian, the supervisor of the western sector’s construction, to investigate. They retrieved the gourd, the stone box, and a single grain of golden elixir. It was said there had been seven grains, but six were lost in the scuffle. The duke placed the gourd in his oratory, offering incense and reverence. The next morning, seven grains of cinnabar, vividly red and extraordinary, appeared. The duke consumed them all. He then ordered the release of all workers involved in the brawl, theft, or loss of the elixir, asking no further questions.\n\n**Prefect Yang**\nPrefect Yang was a eunuch whose given name is lost. At eighteen, he was seized by officials of the underworld and died without illness. After a night, he revived, recounting that upon arriving in the netherworld, he found its bureaucracy and records no different from the mortal realm. The underworld officials showed him a register where his name appeared clearly, noting his lifespan as eighteen years, though no one made any requests of him. A bystander pleaded fervently for his revival, and after some time, the officials granted permission. The man escorted Yang for several hundred paces before parting. Overcome with gratitude for his second life, Yang asked how he might repay him. The man replied, “If you could offer a *mingsha* bow, that would suffice.” He then gave Yang over a hundred large copper coins.\n\nAwakening suddenly, Yang suffered no discomfort. Thereafter, he sought the *mingsha* bow but could not obtain one. Instead, he crafted small models of palace halls, burned them as offerings, and consumed the ashes—this he did several times. Yang devoted himself to alchemy, his heart set on elixirs and minerals, and mastered the art of refining the *fanhun* elixir. When a local lord suddenly died, Yang ground a grain of the elixir, pried open the man’s mouth, and poured it in, reviving him instantly. He saved several lives in this manner.\n\nThere was a palace official named Xiahou who received five grains of the elixir from Yang. Later, when the underworld officials came to claim him, Xiahou explained during the interrogation that he had consumed one grain of Yang’s elixir. The officials immediately sent him back. Upon reviving, Xiahou consumed the remaining four grains. Over a year later, yellow-robed figures came to seize him, clarifying they were not from the underworld but from Mount Tai. Xiahou followed them to the foot of a great mountain, where he saw palatial halls. At the gate, two Daoist priests questioned his past deeds, to which he answered in detail. Then he added, “I have consumed five grains of Prefect Yang’s elixir.” The priests promptly ordered him to return. Xiahou bowed in thanks, saying, “By the power of this divine elixir, I have prolonged my life. May I change my name to *Yannian* (Prolonged Years)?” The priests consented, and thereafter he was known as Xiahou Yannian.\n\nYang, recognizing the miraculous efficacy of his elixir, often used it to save others. His son, Xuan, was returning to the capital from the outskirts when, before dawn, he had traveled over twenty *li* and rested at a large estate. Suddenly, he heard cries of alarm and weeping from within. Upon inquiry, he learned that the host’s son had died suddenly. Xuan took a grain of elixir from his sash, ground it, and poured it into the boy’s mouth, reviving him after some time.\n\nYang was wealthy and retired early, living freely and devoting himself solely to alchemy. He never fell ill and lived to ninety-seven. In his later years, he encountered a man carrying a bow, which he learned was a *mingsha* bow. Within its horn and wood, sand shifted as it moved. Yang purchased it, burned it as an offering, and thus repaid his savior. The formula for the *fanhun* elixir, he claimed, had been taught to him by his rescuer, and he refined it in secret, so none could replicate his art.\n\n**Xue Feng**\nXue Feng of Hedong served as prefect of Sizhou during the Xiantong era (860–874).",

      "translated_text": "A year later, he dreamed of entering a grotto palace, where an abundance of prepared delicacies lay before him. Yet he saw no one, nor dared to eat, so he departed through the mountain gate. Someone said to him, \"This is the Celestial Granary.\"\n\nWhen he recounted this to his guests and friends, one remarked, \"Within the borders of your prefecture, in Changming County, there is a Celestial Granary. Inside its cavern are naturally occurring foods and drinks, which wandering mendicants often find and consume.\" He immediately dispatched the Daoist Sun Lingfeng, along with trusted officials, to investigate.\n\nThey entered the cave and traveled some ten *li*, still requiring torches. Beyond ten *li*, the darkness gradually gave way to brightness. After another three to five *li*, the scene suddenly became indistinguishable from the mortal world. The cavern chambers were vast, capable of holding a thousand people. Below, the ground was level, lined with stone beds upon which lay an array of foods and delicacies, all appearing freshly prepared—soft, sweet, and fragrant. Lingfeng bowed, partook of the meal, and cut open three or five portions to present to Prefect Xue as proof. Yet upon carrying them out of the cave, their forms remained intact but had all turned to stone.\n\nWithin the cave, scattered about were heaps of *mian* and *sou*, piles of salted beans, and mounds of fermented black beans, their quantity beyond measure. Proceeding another one or two *li*, they encountered a swift and surging stream, both wide and deep. Across the water, mountains and rivers stretched out, with dwellings clearly visible, but they dared not cross and turned back. Near the cliffside slope, they observed footprints coming and going, each two to three *chi* in length, as if left by some unseen travelers.\n\nUpon hearing this, Xue marveled at the wondrous and numinous sight, though he could not fathom its cause. I have consulted the *Treatise on Geography*, which states: \"On Mount Shaoshi grow natural grains, sweet fruits, divine mushrooms, and immortal herbs. When Prince Jin of Zhou learned the Dao and ascended as an immortal, he left behind nine thousand years’ worth of provisions on the mountain.\" Mount Shaoshi lies seventeen *li* west of Mount Song. From its eastern ridge, one ascends forty *li* to reach the lower terrace, then another ten *li* to the upper terrace, *Dingsi*. Midway, at twenty *li*, stands a great stone gate, marking the middle terrace. Beyond the middle terrace, descending to the cliff’s edge, one finds a stone chamber containing water and abundant white quartz. Within the chamber are naturally occurring scriptures and sustenance—no different from what was described here.\n\nMoreover, on the eastern side of Mount Tiantai, there is a cave. After entering some ten *li*, one encounters inhabitants and market stalls selling food and drink. During the Qianfu era (874–879), a wandering monk entered the cave and passed through the market, ravenous. Drawn by the aroma, he bought a steamed bun and ate it. His companion, a monk who subsisted on *qi* and had eaten nothing, remained sated. After traveling another ten *li*, they exited the cave, only to find themselves in Muping County, Dengzhou. The monk who had eaten the bun suddenly transformed into stone.\n\nFrom this, we may infer that those who partook of Wang Lie’s stone marrow or Zhang Hua’s dragon fat must have accumulated profound merit and possessed heaven-endowed immortal bones before ascending to the ranks of immortality. If an ordinary person were to consume such things, they would surely turn to stone. The people of Shu...",

Once, as they startled a herd of deer into flight, they split up to pursue them. One man saw a deer dart between two cliffs—barely wide enough for a person to pass—and followed it. After ten-odd steps, he found himself amidst a bustling city with rows of shops and the clamor of wells, the deer nowhere in sight. Wandering through the market, he asked a passerby, \"Where is this place?\" The reply came: \"This is but a lesser Chengdu. It is no place for ordinary folk like you; you should not linger.\" He then exited through a stone cavern, secretly marking the path home, and reported the matter to Prefect Liu Jun.

On the mountain’s summit lies a pool filled with fish and turtles, which all emerge to swim on the seventh day of the seventh month. Halfway up the cliff, within a grotto, are thousands of scrolls—scriptures left behind by an ancient Daoist. During the Yuanjia era (424–453), a tribesman from the southern hills came to this mountain to hunt deer. Pursuing one into a stone cavern, he found a ladder beside the entrance and climbed it. Suddenly, the ladder opened into a vast expanse, revealing another sky and sun. After several dozen steps, he beheld lush mulberry groves and fruit trees, with fields and paths laid out in perfect order. Many people were going about their way. Startled, the tribesman fled, hastily carving marks into trees to record the path. Later, he returned with companions to search, but the place was nowhere to be found.\"\n\nGu Yewang remarked: \"Within heaven and earth, amid the famous mountains, there are grottoes and abodes of divine marvels—not just one or two.

Kang received the book and followed its teachings, divining the past and foreseeing the future, assessing fortune and misfortune—even the famed Jing Fang and Guan Lu could not surpass him. The old man had instructed him to take shelter in Daokang, so he donned a scholar’s cap and settled in the southern pavilion of Xima, west of the Kaiyuan Temple in Yongle Ward. Scholars and officials flocked to him for counsel, their requests unceasing. He had intended to select a dwelling on Mount Zhongtiao but had not yet prepared his plans.\n\nHan Wen, the Left Army Commander-in-Chief, sent envoys three times to summon him. Reluctantly, Kang paid his respects. Upon arrival, he was appointed to a military post with the rank of censor, presented with a golden fish-shaped tally, a jade belt, robes, horses, and boots—all bestowed upon him. Kang donned the official regalia, bowed in gratitude in the courtyard, and returned home.

      "translated_text": "Since then, amid the weapons and armor of the Central Plains and the martial conflicts across the land, all turned to the old man’s words for guidance. The text he bestowed was titled *The Precious Chapters of the Pivot of Fate*.\n\nThe monk Wu Xuan was of unknown origin. Though he dwelt in the garb of a monk, his heart was set on seeking the Dao. From the Three Rivers and Five Ridges to the famous mountains of Qian and Chu, there was nowhere he did not travel. Wherever he encountered a grotto-heaven, he would invariably visit it.\n\nUpon entering Mount Emei, he heard there were seventy-two caves. Beyond the Thunder Cave, among the cliffs, stone chambers, and deep caverns, none remained unvisited. One day, he rested beneath a great tree. After some time, an old man appeared, ascending from below. They exchanged bows and sat together.\n\nThe old man asked where he was bound, and Wu Xuan recounted his quest to visit famous mountains and sacred grottoes. The old man said: \"Famous mountains and great rivers all have grottoes, but without knowing their names, one cannot casually enter to explore. One must obtain *The Record of Dongting* and *The Scripture of the Sacred Peaks*, examine their affiliations, determine their names, and verify their locations. Only when these match the records of immortals’ dwellings may one venture forth. Otherwise, there are Wind-and-Thunder Caves, Ghost-and-Spirit Caves, Hell Caves, and Dragon-and-Serpent Caves—mistaken entry may cost one’s life, turning a quest for benefit into harm. This is deeply to be guarded against.\"\n\nWu Xuan was startled for a long while before thanking the old man for his instruction. He then asked: \"As for the grotto-heavens of Mount Emei, may one safely visit them?\" The old man replied: \"I dare not speak much of the affairs of immortals, but if you pay respects to the master of the cave, you may inquire of him yourself.\"\n\nWu Xuan asked further who the cave master was. The old man said: \"The cave master’s surname is Zhang. He is now at the market gate of Jiazhou, where he works as a butcher. He is the middle-aged, stout man there.\" With that, he took his leave.\n\nWu Xuan returned to the market gate and found Zhang there.",

      "translated_text": "Wu Xuan recounted the previous events to Zhang, who said: \"Say no more.\" He then instructed his wife to cook meat and offered it to Wu Xuan as a meal, presenting three dishes of it. Wu Xuan declined, saying he had not eaten meat for a long time. Zhang replied: \"To travel the mountains, one must have strength and avoid exhaustion—only then can you proceed. If you refuse this, you will never reach your destination.\" He urged Wu Xuan repeatedly, who then pondered to himself, fearing this might be a test by an immortal, and dared not disobey. He consumed two dishes, his hunger and thirst growing ever more intense, while Zhang continued to press him, though he could eat no more. After finishing, Wu Xuan asked to leave. Zhang stooped to pick up a piece of tile and handed it to him, saying: \"When you enter the mountains and reach such-and-such a peak, you will find the gate of such-and-such a cave. There stands a tall pine, below it a cave stream, above it sheer cliffs—this is the grotto where the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign dwells. Strike the gate with this tile, twenty or thirty times, and the door will open. At each gate you encounter, knock thus, and you will reach the realm of the immortals.\" Following his instructions, Wu Xuan entered the mountains and indeed found the cave, just as described. He struck the gate with the tile, and after a long while, the sheer cliff parted, revealing a vast and level cavern within, wide enough for carriages and horses. On either side, smooth green stone gleamed, with hanging springs and flowing channels flanking the path. After traveling more than ten *li*, he came to another gate. Knocking, it opened again, revealing an even vaster and more expansive space. Along the way, celestial blossoms lined the path, and the rare flowers and extraordinary sights he glimpsed—along with the throngs of figures passing by, mostly fair maidens and lovely women, jade lads and immortal maidens, and at times, immortal officials and Daoist masters with their retinues of carriages and attendants—filled the scene without end. He reached yet another gate and knocked with even greater urgency, but the tile shattered completely, and the door remained shut. After a long while, he heard a sound like thunder, as if the mountain were collapsing, and in terror, he fled outward. After running thirty or fifty paces, he found himself outside the cave entrance, with none of the earlier scenery remaining. When he sought the cave master again, more than a month had passed. The butcher’s stall was still there, but Zhang had already been dead for over ten days. From then on, Wu Xuan was determined to visit famous mountains, vowing to seek transcendence. Later, he entered Mount Emei and was never heard from again.\n\nFei Guanqing\nFei Guanqing was a native of Chizhou. After passing the imperial examinations, he prepared to return to his hometown and bid farewell to Chancellor Zheng Yuqing. The Chancellor had long been on good terms with Liu Ling, the magistrate of Qiupu, and was pleased by Fei’s journey. He entrusted Fei with a letter to deliver. The handwritten letter filled a sheet, which Zheng sealed and handed to Fei, cautioning him: \"Magistrate Liu has long been in official circles. The reason he has not advanced in the rankings is his impetuous and unconstrained nature, which does not conform to the times. Though he has set aside high office for this post, you should treat him well.\" Fei then asked the Chancellor to add a few words of recommendation at the end of the letter, hoping to secure a favorable reception. Zheng agreed, opened the letter, wrote several lines, and resealed it as before. Fei arrived in Qiupu and first presented his calling card to Liu. Liu glanced at it, tossed it onto his desk, and paid no further attention. Fei stood nervously awaiting instructions, but after a long while, no response came. Suspecting Liu’s displeasure, he handed the Chancellor’s letter to the attendant. Liu broke the seal, read it, and scoffed: \"What use is this letter from that old man Zheng?\" He crumpled it and cast it aside. Fei grew even more fearful and, pushing open the door, entered and hurried forward to bow before him. Liu suddenly turned and looked at him with pity, then gestured for him to sit and spoke with him. As dusk fell, Liu urged him to find an inn, but Fei said: \"The day has grown dark, and I may not reach a lodging in time. I beg to spend the night here, even if only on the floor of the hall. Tomorrow, I will go to an inn.\" He then opened his luggage and spread out a felt mat on the ground. Liu brushed off his robes and entered, emerging after a long while to say: \"This is no place to receive guests. There is a small chamber where you may rest. Your servants can stay outside.\" He then ordered his attendants to lead Fei’s servants and guards to separate quarters. Liu led Fei, carrying his mat, into a small chamber behind the hall. The door was then shut, the lock fastened tightly, leaving Fei bewildered. He sat on the bed to rest.\n\nThat night, the moon shone brightly. Peering through the crack in the door, he saw no sound or movement outside. Then he observed Magistrate Liu personally taking up a broom and dustpan, sweeping the hall inside and out, the courtyard, steps, and walls—nothing was left untouched. Astonished, Fei sat upright, holding his breath, watching without sleep. As the second watch approached, a strange fragrance, unlike anything in the mortal world, filled the air. After a long while, Liu stood holding a tablet, bowing reverently in the courtyard as if awaiting someone. The fragrance grew stronger, and suddenly, a celestial figure in a cloud crown and purple robes, eight or nine *chi* tall, arrived with dozens of attendants. Liu prostrated himself in obeisance. The immortal strode directly into the hall, with Liu standing by his side. Soon, a banquet was laid out, with rare delicacies and exotic fruits in fragrant containers. Fei, though unseen, felt his spirit clear and his breath ease. Before long, music played and wine was poured. Liu was ordered to spread a mat on the ground and attend the feast. The melodies were unlike any earthly tunes. The immortal suddenly asked: \"Have you received news from Zheng?\" Liu replied: \"I have. He is well.\" After a moment, the immortal asked again: \"Did you receive Zheng’s letter?\" Liu answered: \"Fei Guanqing, a recent graduate, came from Chang’an and brought it.\" The immortal smiled and said: \"Fei Guanqing is fortunate to have passed the examinations. Is he here now?\" Liu replied: \"He is.\"",

First, give him a cup of wine, and tell him only that if he cultivates the Dao early, he may then meet with me.\" Thereupon, he ordered Liu to pour a cup of wine and place it in a lidded box. Fei watched as Liu drank the wine himself, then dropped the cup into a basin of water beneath the steps. Fei hesitated, leaving the wine untouched. Suddenly, the immortal descended the steps, and with his disciples, ascended upon the clouds and departed. Liu bowed in farewell, weeping. The immortal admonished him: \"When you see Zheng, tell him only to cultivate the Dao, and he may then meet with me.\" After they had gone, Liu immediately went to the box and found the wine still there. Astonished, he exclaimed: \"This wine is a once-in-ten-thousand-kalpas encounter—why did you not drink it?\" Fei struggled to take one or two sips, and Liu then became his companion in Daoist cultivation. They chose to reside on Mount Jiuhua, and though summoned to court as *Zuoshiyi*, he never accepted the post. Soon after, Chancellor Zheng passed away. Liu and Fei kept the matter secret, never knowing which immortal it was who had descended.\n\n**Ziluo Elder Ren**\nWhen Zheng Nanhai served as governor of Liang and Song, his cousin, the scholar Liu, was residing in Ruzhou.

Passing by an apothecary’s shop, he sat down, and an old woodcutter leaned against the wall, also taking a seat. The shopkeeper repeatedly scolded him, saying: \"This is an official’s guest—why do you barge in so rudely!\" Liu straightened his robes and rose, saying to the shopkeeper: \"I am but an idle man. This woodcutter has come for a reason—perhaps he seeks medicine or has an urgent request. Do not send him away.\" He earnestly invited the elder to sit and asked what he needed. The elder said: \"I only ask for a sheet of paper and brush and ink.\" Liu immediately took paper and brush from the shop and gave them to him. The elder wielded the brush with ease, wrote swiftly, and handed the paper to Liu. It read:\n\n*Since you wish to go to Liang and Song,*\n*Know that calamity weighs heavy there.*\n*Day and night, you’ll face false accusations.*\n*Since you wish to visit Zheng,*\n*Zheng will soon meet with misfortune,*\n*Becoming a wanderer a thousand li away,*\n*And changing even the color of his robes.*\n*—Written by Ren, the woodcutter of Ziluo Mountain.*\n\nLiu read it with astonishment—the brushwork was bold and transcendent, surpassing the ordinary. As he read, the elder vanished. A month later, Zheng was falsely accused, stripped of his office, and exiled a thousand *li* away, all as foretold. Liu then built a dwelling on Ziluo Mountain and sought the elder everywhere, but never saw him again. The world treasured his writing, though when bandits raided the capital, it was lost.\n\n**Zhu Hanzhen**\nZhu Hanzhen was a Daoist from Jinling.",

In the *bingzi* year of the Dazhong era, the Daoist Ma Ziran, a wandering figure in Jiang-Zhe, made merry with wine and leisure his sole pursuit. Yet many marveled at him, suspecting he was one who had attained the Dao. Whenever he visited Hanzhen, he would insist on staying, and Hanzhen always did his utmost to host him. After more than a year, Ma said to Hanzhen: \"I have long wandered Jiang-Zhe, but now I shall journey north. The sacred peaks of Song and Luo, the divine precincts of Hua—these are the abodes of immortals, where one feasts on harmony and savors the Dao. A Daoist cannot but visit them. You possess the will to cultivate, yet lack the means for offerings; you have a heart to pity the world, yet no power to save it—this is truly lamentable.\" Thereupon, he bestowed upon Hanzhen three talismans, saying: \"These will provide for your clothing and food for life. They will infinitely multiply your hidden merits. Use the jade script to heal, and even a thousand demons or a hundred ailments will be cured. First apply one talisman; if it proves ineffective, then deploy the second. No affliction will resist the third. Aid the poor and sick, seek little gold or silk, and when your merit is full and your virtue complete, the Dao will be near.\" He then inscribed a wooden plaque with a twenty-character poem beneath the hempen curtain:\n\n*\"The world holds endless affairs,*\n*Life’s knowledge unfolds day by spring.*\n*Ask the road beyond the mundane—*\n*Straight is the path to Shangqing’s realm.\"*\n\nHe signed it: *\"Written by the Mountain Wanderer, Ma Ziran.\"* With that, he took his leave and was never seen again. Years later, word spread that Master Ma had ascended to heaven in broad daylight. From then on, Hanzhen’s talismans proved extraordinarily effective. From Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinling, and the Huai-Hai region—across a thousand *li* in all directions—letters and messengers flew to him, begging for his healing, their numbers beyond count. With the silver he earned, he founded the Eastern Sage Ancestral Hall, its halls adorned with cinnabar, emerald, gold, and azure, its painted murals renowned in their time. Hanzhen lived to over seventy, passing without illness, and all said he had already entered the registers of the Dao, one of the liberated.\n\n**Wu Shan Jing**\nWu Shan Jing studied the Dao on Mount Song for over a decade, diligently seeking grottoes and traversing secluded wonders. One day, he came upon a cavern entrance, over a *zhang* wide and five or six *chi* high. He entered slowly, and as he advanced, the space gradually widened. The candle flickered out, the path stretched far, and with no way to gauge distance, he groped forward. After two or three *li*, he felt as though enveloped in thick mist. After several more *li*, it suddenly brightened, the mountains and rivers unfolding before him, the view stretching endlessly in all directions. Beneath a rocky grotto, he saw five or six Daoists. He hurried forward to pay his respects, but by the time he arrived, only one remained. Shan Jing bowed and introduced himself, recounting his fortunate encounter and entreating the immortal for the essentials of prolonging life and transcending the world. The immortal, pleased, replied: \"Your earnest devotion is rare. That you have met me is the fruition of accumulated goodness. The Way of transcending the world requires one’s name to be inscribed in the Azure Register, and one must be born with immortal bones—this is not easily spoken of. Yet your longing for the Dao is pitiable.\" He then said: \"Return to the world of men; we shall meet again later.\" Pointing to several scrolls on a stone bed, he instructed Shan Jing to fetch one. When Shan Jing brought it, the immortal smiled: \"I cannot yet teach you the Way of leaving the world. For now, read this—it will allow you to collate scriptures in the human realm, discern celestial patterns, and decipher jade graphs, aiding rulers and augmenting your merit.\" He had Shan Jing read it, but Shan Jing recognized nothing. The immortal then imparted the secret gestures, repeating them earnestly. Shan Jing suddenly understood, grasping every detail. The immortal then sent him out of the mountain, directing him along another path. In an instant, he found himself in Luoyang.\n\nFrom then on, the jade scripts, red writings, treasure chapters, and true secrets in the scroll became as clear to him as clerical script. When Emperor Xianzong renovated the inner palace, a talisman was discovered within the bracket sets, unrecognized by anyone inside or outside the court. Someone mentioned that Shan Jing was skilled in celestial script, so he was summoned to the palace and shown the talisman. He read it fluently, without hesitation, and was rewarded with gold and silk. He was then ordered to annotate and present it. The emperor commanded the Taiqing Abbey to provide him with special support, and the Daoist Qiong of Xing Tang Abbey became his disciple, mastering all his secrets. Qiong transcribed the *Dao De Jing*, the *Inner* and *Outer Chapters of the Yellow Court*, the *Scripture of Life and Spirit*, the *Scripture of Disaster Dispelling*, and other texts—nearly ten scrolls—using celestial script and jade graphs. He also annotated the talismans of the Three Caverns, standardizing their pronunciation with seal script.\n\nIn the Xiantong era, Shan Jing was summoned to the three palaces and taught over seven hundred disciples, including Yi Xi Xian Sheng and Wan Yu Ke. The celestial scriptures he was to transcribe remained unfinished when Qiong passed away, so the emperor posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Zhao Xuan Xian Sheng*. Shan Jing lived in Luoyang for over ninety years, his appearance like that of a child, his teeth and hair unaged. He spoke of traveling the Five Ridges, then vanished without a trace. When Zhao Xuan died, he was over ninety. The celestial scriptures he had written were obtained by Wu Fang Yi, a Daoist from Shangrao, who took them to the Zhongnan Mountains. During the chaos of Huang Chao’s rebellion, they were scattered and lost.\n\n**Yang Huizhi**\nYang Huizhi journeyed east from Chang’an through Wu and Chu, arriving at Wujiang.",

A month later, Zheng was falsely accused, stripped of his office, and exiled a thousand *li* away, all as foretold.

      "translated_text": "Hearing that Master Wang possessed profound arts of the Dao, Yang Huizhi sought him out at his gate. The master wore a black headscarf and coarse hempen robe, sitting with his arms resting on a low table, his bearing refined and elegant. Huizhi bowed twice in full reverence, and the master returned his salute with clasped hands, inviting him to sit. Their conversation flowed with lofty and unconstrained discourse. By evening, it was the twelfth day of the eighth month.\n\nThe master summoned his daughter, Seventh Maiden, who appeared as an old crone—over seventy years of age, her teeth and hair entirely withered, her steps halting and stooped as she arrived. The master said to Huizhi, “This is my daughter. Lazy and disinclined toward the Dao, she has now grown old.” Then, turning to Seventh Maiden, he instructed, “Carve a paper moon for this evening and place it upon the eastern wall of the chamber.” Soon after, Seventh Maiden affixed the paper moon to the eastern wall, and suddenly a radiant glow burst forth, illuminating the entire room so that even the finest details were discernible.\n\nMaster Wang and Huizhi conversed within the chamber, where a biting chill pressed upon them as if they stood halfway to heaven. As dawn approached and Huizhi prepared to take his leave, the master traced a line in the courtyard dust with his staff. When Huizhi looked again at their surroundings, he saw towering cliffs and ravines, forests of trees piercing the sky, and before them a vast expanse of water stretching beyond sight.\n\nHuizhi stood with the master at the water’s edge, trembling in awe and astonishment. He exclaimed, “How can such transformations occur! Last night’s encounter and this morning’s sight—could this be a single night in the realm of immortals, yet a thousand years in the world of men?” The master smiled and said, “I merely meant it as amusement.” With a shake of his robes and a wave of his hand, the courtyard and gate instantly returned to their former state. Huizhi fled in haste, daring not to glance back.",

      "translated_text": "Fang Jian of Qinghe\n\nFang Jian of Qinghe dwelt in the mountains, prizing the extraordinary and devoted to the Dao. For twenty years, he studied the talismans of the Six Jia and the Nine Chapters of the True Register. Later, he journeyed to Mount Heng, where he encountered a Daoist adept. When he inquired about the immortal realms of Penglai and Fangzhang and the wonders of the spirit world, the adept recounted each in turn as if he had witnessed them himself. They traveled together for over ten days, and Fang Jian could not bear to part from him.\n\nAs Fang Jian prepared to set out for the Southern Sea, the Daoist said, “I have often wandered the Southern Sea these past ten years. The Protector-General Li once gifted me a jade hairpin, and as you are devoted to the Dao, I now bestow it upon you—treasure it well.” That autumn, Fang Jian arrived at the Southern Sea and wandered alone to the Kaiyuan Abbey. In its north gallery stood two clay statues of Perfected Ones, one named Zuo Xuan, the other You Xuan. Gazing at Zuo Xuan, Fang Jian saw that his appearance was identical to the Daoist he had met on Mount Heng. He marveled in astonishment for a long while, then noticed that the statue’s headdress lacked its hairpin. He asked the Daoists of the abbey, “What are these Perfected Ones called, and why is the hairpin missing from this one?” A Daoist replied, “Ten years ago, the Protector-General Li often adorned the Perfected One’s headdress with a jade hairpin, but it vanished some months past.”\n\nFang Jian recounted how the hairpin had been gifted to him on Mount Heng, then drew it from his pouch and restored it to the statue.\n\nThe Monk Qixu\n\nThe monk Qixu, surnamed Li, was the son of an imperial censor during the Kaiyuan era. From childhood, he was drawn to the teachings of the Buddha. At twenty, he shaved his head, donned a monk’s robe, and took up residence in a Buddhist temple in Chang’an. When Emperor Minghuang fled to Shu and the Jie Hu sacked the two capitals, Qixu entered Mount Taibai, where he subsisted on pine needles and abstained from grain. There he met the Daoist Master Qiao, a man of gaunt and lofty bearing, his beard and temples snowy white. Master Qiao said to Qixu, “Your spirit and bones are solitary and refined—you are destined to wander the immortal realms.” Qixu humbly declined the praise.\n\nMaster Qiao continued, “One day, when you are at Mount Shang preparing food, you will encounter a porter at an inn. Offer him provisions, and if he asks what you seek, say only that you wish to journey to Zhichuan. He will guide you there.” After An Lushan’s rebellion was quelled and the Supreme Emperor returned to the capital, the realm knew peace once more. Qixu then went to an inn at Mount Shang, where he prepared meals and offered them to porters. For nearly half a year, he fed hundreds of them, yet none inquired after his purpose. Growing weary, Qixu concluded that Master Qiao had deceived him and prepared to return to Chang’an.\n\nThen, one day, he encountered a young porter by a river. The youth asked where Qixu was bound, and he replied, “I have long wished to journey to Zhichuan.” The porter exclaimed in surprise, “Zhichuan is an immortal’s abode—how could one reach it?” Qixu said, “From childhood, I have been devoted to the Dao. I once met a perfected one who urged me to seek Zhichuan, though I know not the way.” The porter said, “Come with me, and I will take you there.”\n\nTogether, they traveled to Shangli in Lantian, then ascended Mount Yu, traversing perilous cliffs and jagged crags for over eighty li. They came to a cavern from which water flowed. The porter and Qixu carried stones to dam the stream, and after three days, the water ceased. They entered the cavern, where darkness made it impossible to see. In the distance, a gate appeared, some ten li away. They walked toward it, and upon emerging, found the wind and sunlight gentle, the mountains and waters clear and lovely.\n\nAfter journeying over a hundred li, they climbed a towering peak, its summit sheer and its stone path treacherous. Qixu grew dizzy and dared not proceed, but the porter said, “The immortal realm is near—do not turn back now.” Taking his hand, he led him upward. At the summit, they found a vast, level expanse, from which the peaks and rivers below were indistinct. They traveled another hundred li and entered another cavern, then emerged after several dozen li to see an endless expanse of water. A stone path, barely a foot wide, stretched across it for a hundred li. The porter led Qixu onto the path, and with trembling steps, they crossed, daring not look down.\n\nAt last, they reached the foot of a mountain, where a colossal tree stood, its branches lush and verdant, towering over a hundred feet. The porter climbed the tree and let out a long whistle. After a time, a wind stirred the treetops, and suddenly a thick rope descended from the mountain’s summit, bearing a bamboo basket. The porter and Qixu entered the basket, closed their eyes, and sat in tense stillness as if soaring upward. A great rope pulled them aloft, and soon they reached the summit.\n\nThere, cities and palaces gleamed with pearls and jade, suspended beyond the clouds.
