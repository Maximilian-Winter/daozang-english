  "full_translation": "**Inscription on the Stele of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Brick Inscription of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu*\n*Composed by:* Yue Penggui of the Tang Dynasty\n*One fascicle.*\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Records and Biographies* section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n**Inscription on the Stele of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu**\nComposed by Yue Penggui, Grand Academician of the Hanlin Academy, Senior Grand Master for Court Audiences, Acting Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, Pillar of State, and Recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag.\n\nOf old, the eighty-one heavens correspond to half the lifespan of the Most High; six million years mark the initial years of the Primordial Beginning. The Dao, vast and boundless, is difficult to fathom; its essence, subtle and formless, defies inquiry. It dwells beyond form and image, before the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity. When the kalpas of Dragon Han had twice renewed and the records of Phoenix Epochs were yet unestablished, it concealed its sprouts within the boundless void and hid its roots and trunk in the primal deluge.\n\nTwo deities, bearing the cosmos upon their backs, arrived together, carving open creation. The Three Qi intermingled and advanced, the undifferentiated chaos dispersing into primordial matter. Dark and yellow flowed yet uncoagulated; pure and turbid divided and suddenly congealed. Within the realm of sun, moon, and stars, numinous palaces took form; amid rivers, plains, mountains, and peaks, grotto-heavens emerged.\n\nThus, the Dao is the ancestor of the myriad qi, and virtue is the origin of the hundred things. It takes the Two Modes and the Two Luminaries as its descendants, the Five Phases and Four Images as its branches and leaves. When the great inception first commenced and the Purple Ultimate later took shape, gazing upward, its height knew no limit; examining its summit, no higher could be found. The Eight Lords with hoary heads witnessed the time before heaven and earth existed; the Nine Elders with white brows beheld the era when heaven and earth first arose.\n\nDelving into the principles of the utmost truth and attaining the origin of the Great Dao, the realms of the immortals extend endlessly, and the lifespans of superior scholars grow ever more distant. Six thousand springs are but two months—still they sigh at the fleeting nature of life; seventy thousand years are but two years—yet they lament the brevity of existence.\n\nThe wise perceive it as wisdom; the benevolent perceive it as benevolence. Harmonizing its light, all radiance is but transient; blunting its edge, all drills and awls shatter. The Mystic Pearl is not to be grasped from below; the true unhewn jade bears no flaw.\n\nThose who learn and thereby know it are middling; those who know it by birth are supreme. The Three Lords and Five Elders regard the multitudes as fermenting wine; the Seven Sages and Nine August Ones see the common folk as straw dogs. Warming a thousand ages, all is dissolved like ice; accomplishing myriad virtues, all flows like a spring.\n\nUtmost clarity appears obscure—yet when the obscure is questioned, all matters are illuminated. Utmost skill appears clumsy—yet within clumsiness, all things are accomplished. Acting through non-action, it is useful in its uselessness. Rejecting the palate’s delight in the five flavors, blocking the ear’s acuity to the eight sounds, forgetting images and words, one easily sheds the sandals of a single moment. Without bolts, the gate is closed; with difficulty, the gate to the myriad wonders is opened.\n\nNinety thousand spirit immortals gather within the pore of a single hair; three thousand Confucian guards lie desolate at the tip of a unicorn’s horn. Thus, the two gates of Dao and Confucianism share the same warp and weft. Establishing purity and stillness as governance, embodying emptiness and non-being as the teacher.\n\nAbove, heaven serves as the wheel of the great chariot; the constellations serve as its spokes. It is harnessed to the horses of Qian, drawn by the oxen of Kun. It transports the merit of non-action, bearing and sustaining the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nRadiant yet not dazzling, it nurtures correctness within obscurity. Simple yet incorruptible, it cultivates truth within narrow confines. It cannot be distanced—separated from it, it is not far; it cannot be drawn near—employed, it grows ever more distant.\n\nNeither retreating to yield nor advancing to seek, the man who wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within is beauty upon beauty. The scholar who seeks the formless pearl—where shall he find it?\n\nShifting worlds into a gourd, one swallows the room of a fangzhang; shrinking the earth’s form into a sleeve, one conceals the city of Rajagrha. The root of the Dao, cultivated, becomes the foundation of heaven; the uncarved block of namelessness marks the origin of transformation.\n\nThree thousand rules of deportment are reverently observed in the teachings of the literary wind; five hundred precepts and practices are solemnly purified within the gates of the Śākya clan. Stretching heaven as a bow, it is tuned with yin and yang, cold and heat. The straight Dao is like an arrow, propelled by spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\n\nA single man uses it without exhausting it; the myriad people use it without depletion. The caves of the sun and moon conceal the body, once dwelling in caverns; the southern and northern darknesses skirt the edges, briefly roaming the watery abodes.\n\nPeach Blossom Spring and Penglai Isle have existed from ancient times to the present; the Scholarly Market and the Dim Altar are seen flourishing at dawn and dusk. The secret charts of immortality have been transmitted thrice over five thousand years; the numinous Dao of the sages appears once in a hundred thousand years.\n\nThose who study it with ease are like twisting stone to make rope; those who seek it with arrogance are like drilling ice to await fire. Abandoning skill and forsaking profit, it reveals the subtle and elucidates the obscure. Within the palaces of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui, officials dwell as feathered guests; within the Dipper of east, west, south, and north, immortals reside as true transcendents.\n\nThe body rides the chariot of virtue, its wheels turning beyond the primordial chaos; the hand holds the handle of longevity, directing all before the unfolding of creation. Serene and without striving, tranquil and self-content, transforming what is not transformed, all transformations are accomplished; giving life to what is not born, all living things attain fulfillment.\n\nWith an empty heart, it awaits all things; with a broad mind, it receives the seasons. Hiding Mount Tai within a autumn hair’s tip—yet the hair remains vast; containing Kunlun within a millet grain—yet the grain remains spacious.\n\nThe great image is without form—thus the Five Peaks are empty and silent; the great trust requires no pact—thus the four seasons proceed in wordless motion. The teachings of the true lineage are all accomplished; the merit of non-governance grows ever more manifest.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Golden Gates, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Emperor—he is the exalted ancestor of our Great Tang. According to the *Discourses of the States*, from the seventh year of King Ping of Zhou to the Sacred, Civil, Divine, and Martial Emperor of the Kaiyuan era, he is the thirty-sixth sagely descendant.\n\nHis illustrious radiance, like the sun’s sprouts, casts shade beneath all heaven; his luminous virtue, like the leaves of the state, bestows fragrance upon the shores of the realm.\n\nWhen the hidden depths first unfolded, the nine qi steamed and stirred without cease; the mysterious transformation spread wide, the six voids flowed and turned without rest. Establishing the gate of the non-dual teaching, he examined the root of the True One. The vast wind blew across the sea, three revolutions reduced the world to flying dust; the kalpa-fire consumed the mountains, five cycles leveled them to flat earth. First he wandered in the Blue Eon—when the Blue Eon had run its course, later he emerged and vanished in the Red Radiance—when the Red Radiance too was complete.\n\nNinety-nine myriad billion years were stored in a pellet; five thousand five hundred layered heavens were concealed within an eggshell. At the time when High Ancestor Tang of Yin ascended the throne, when King Wen of Zhou first unfolded the *Yi*, divine radiance flowed into the jade womb, auspicious splendor knit into golden bones. Unsplit, unsevered, he gestated for more than eighty years; descending blessings and omens, he surpassed the span of twenty thousand days. His feet trod the principle of imperishability, his hands grasped the writ of long life. He embraced Qian and enfolded Kun, seized the sun and grasped the moon. His brow bore the stars of Shen and Wu, his crown upheld the round vault; his ears opened the Three Gates, his nose stood as twin pillars. His blood was white, his brain purple; his liver azure, his spleen green. His nape drew forth thirty-five rays, his teeth held forty-eight cowries. Seven-hued blue lotuses followed his steps, a thousand-year white deer presented their felicity.\n\nThough mulberry fields changed, the twin cypresses never withered; though rivers ran dry, the nine wells never failed. In the village of Lai in Ku County, numinous traces endure; on the banks of Wo Spring in Chen State, divine footprints do not fade. Seven hundred disciples pointed to Fusang as their old grove; the Nine-Five Lord opened the Sun Palace as his former abode.\n\nTracing his primordial beginning, examining that earliest origin, he looked down upon the darkness before the Dark Ford, gazed below into the chaos after the Primal Undifferentiated. Adapting his teaching to the moment, he became the model for the Nine Ancients; responding to change without fixed method, he set the pattern for a hundred kings.\n\nWhen the year began with Sheti, inaugurating the signs of qi, thirteen sages ascended the throne, fulfilling the chart of eighteen thousand years. Our Most High Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor answered the moment and descended in manifestation, serving as teacher to the Heavenly Sovereign. At the first opening of the Upper Purity and Lower Turbidity, the separation was not distant; at the sudden rending of the Six Directions and Eight Cords, the division was not far. He set right the forms of square and round, above and below; he determined the state of vast primeval simplicity. Rivers newly melted yet waters remained murky; mountains first congealed yet stones were not yet firm. He sowed the white elms of heaven, which first sprouted in rows; he planted the green osmanthus of the moon, which just then grew in clusters. He matched the Four Seas to the Four Spirits, entrusted the Five Phases to the Five Emperors.\n\nAt that time, the image of Qian still hung low, the form of Kun remained thin. Establishing the pole and fixing positions, he spread transformation and built merit. Our Most High Sage Ancestor condescended to descend, serving as teacher to the Earthly Sovereign. Allotting hard and soft, he instituted cold and heat; the earth grew broader and thicker, the sky higher and brighter. His sagely power was unfathomable, his divine work inscrutable. Ten thousand trees split their husks, ten thousand grasses hooked their sprouts. Feathered flocks and furred herds were distinguished in the positions of Dui and Li; shelled creatures and scaled kinds were divided in the palaces of Kan and Zhen. The waters of the Four Directions were all empty—fish and turtles not yet born; the forms of the Five Peaks were all still—clouds and mist not yet exhaled.\n\nHaving passed the years of the Clear Sea, he departed from the age of the Clear Sea. When the Two Sages had governed, the Four Quarters shone with light. Our Most High Sage Ancestor broadly bestowed and saved the multitude, serving as teacher to the Human Sovereign. The three hundred sixty rivers first divided their veins; the eleven thousand five hundred stalks just then matched odd and even. The gods of Three Ren and Three Yi departed the womb of water and wood; the generals of Six Bing and Six Xin emerged from the gestation of fire and wind. For one hundred fifty-six generations, forty-five thousand years, he was first called Master of the Mysterious Dao, then titled Lord Emperor of the Golden Gates. His three names were Master Pan Gu.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor, to broadly save with the Dao, descended in manifestation as his teacher. Gazing up at the patterns of the round canopy, looking down at the principles of the square earth, he taught him to draw the Eight Trigrams, instructed him in the division of the Three Powers. He aided him in creating written characters to replace knotted cords, in establishing governance to succeed the age of tying knots. The *Three Ritual Classics* and *Five Canons* issued from him, the classics and scriptures arose from him. In hunting and fishing, he took the image of the bright Li; in the first and second divinations, he employed the work of the issuing Zhen. Phoenixes presented auspices in the imperial court; the dragon-horse bore the chart on the Yellow and Luo Rivers. He reigned for eighteen thousand years.\n\nWhen Lianshan ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor, to save the age, humbled himself and descended as imperial teacher. He entrusted him with the Five Movements, divided for him the Four Seasons. He aided him in ordering the ten thousand affairs, enlightened him in distinguishing the hundred grains. He transformed the age of drinking blood and eating raw flesh, shifted the sound of earthen drums and clay chimes. He destroyed caves and burned nests, raised beams above and built eaves below. He smelted metal and molded clay, cooked millet and split piglets. He fashioned plows to aid the multitudes, made pottery to benefit the myriad things. Heaven rained grain to present auspices, earth sprouted crops to display abundance. People ate fine grains, mountains produced tools and chariots.\n\nWhen the Lord of Youxiong ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor concealed himself within Kongtong, released his mind beyond the distant dark. The emperor personally descended in his carriage, offering rites to honor the teacher-disciple bond. He hastened to the corner in tattered robes, then bent his knees to inquire of the Dao. At that time, the tyrant of Yu Gang oppressed, Chiyou rebelled. He transformed fish and turtles into soldiers to aid the royal army, changed clouds and mist into spirits to secretly assist the battle lines. He ended war at Zhuolu, stilled weapons at Banquan. He bound the roaming to the land of Qingqiu, reached north to the scene of Hongti. He received the cinnabar scriptures at Wangwu, ascended the azure void at Dinghu. The bending plant sprouted, the divine beans reappeared—if not for the Great Dao, who could achieve this?\n\nWhen the Lord of Jintian ruled all under heaven, inheriting the source of the Ji River and the records of Xiong Mountain, he announced to heaven and emulated the emperor, drilling into the thread to uphold the texts.\n\nOur Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor descended in a chariot drawn by nine dragons, assuming the role of teacher and styled as Master of the Great Ultimate. He expounded the canons of solemn reverence, instructing in the rites of aligning with the seasons and welcoming the qi, luminously matching the numinous powers, honoring the Six Ancestral Spirits, and conducting sacrifices to the host of sacred sites. With ceaseless diligence and awe, he attained the proper measure of ritual. The feathered tribes displayed their auspiciousness, and he appointed them to govern as the Avian Officials, distributing the Nine Birds to oversee the hundred bureaus. Radiance conjoined with jade to manifest numinosity, and the phoenix bore the celestial chart in proclamation—all through the supreme Dao, which revealed this imperial design.\n\nWhen the High Lord of Yang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor taught him to resolve conflicts and unblock obstructions, to govern the state and pacify the people. He swept away the Nine Li tribes, illuminating the Eight Virtues. There were the savage brutes with wild purple beards, the chieftains with serpentine bodies and crimson hair—so mighty they uprooted Mount Buzhou, their heads shattering the peaks. Heaven tilted to the northwest, causing the sun and moon to course westward; earth sank in the southeast, making the rivers and seas flow eastward. He summoned the Six Jia spirits, commanded the hundred numina, instructing them in the subtle-worded scriptures and teaching them the Dao of Great Compliance. Mounting a swift chariot of dark rainbow, he journeyed to the hidden mounds; riding a pale-glass carriage, he roamed afar to the coiled trees. Beholding our immortal catalpa, which blooms but once in ten thousand years, and gazing upon our sacred gourd, which bears fruit but once in four kalpas.\n\nWhen the High Lord of Xin ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor spread the Dao and disseminated transformation, aiding the age as its teacher. He discoursed on the wondrous words of the *Huangting*, concealing the sun and eluding the moon; he proclaimed the auspicious titles of the celestial charts, shifting cities and relocating settlements. He established the names of the Nine Provinces, composed the *Six Elegances* music, enfeoffed Goumang to assist the Azure Emperor, and summoned Rushou to aid the White Realm. He sealed Mount Tai with golden mud, illuminating the entire realm as if unveiling a jade mirror. He drank from the Well of Great Vitality, wandered the Land of Unending Day, anointed himself with the grease of the green simurgh to sustain the ranks of lesser immortals, and carved the flesh of the yellow qilin to serve as delicacies for exalted guests.\n\nWhen the Lord of Tao and Tang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor briefly bestowed the perfect principles, descending to serve as teacher. He expounded the scriptures of mysterious virtue to rectify the profound transformation, responding to the auspicious name of Crimson Mound in hopes of joining the ranks of Crimson Mound. Gentle and harmonious, the clear breeze made no sound at Wutiao; radiant and joyful, the yellow-haired elders were heard playing the *jiqiang* game. Meat and jerky in the kitchens grew of their own accord, rendering seasonings superfluous; sweet springs welled forth in the valleys, rendering fermentation useless. He opened the Four Gates to extend the Fourfold Wisdom, established the Five Affairs, and disseminated the Five Teachings. Donning a deer-fur robe, he ate oysters to assuage hunger; seated upright upon the earthen steps, he composed his thoughts. Wearing a crane-feather cloak, he drank the flowing rosy clouds, meditating in the Jasper Gardens.\n\nWhen the Lord of Yu ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor discoursed on the principle of non-action and expounded the scriptures of separation and union. The Three Miao tribes were subdued, the Four Offenders all submitted. The hundred offices followed their seasons, and the Five Canons were observed with care. He bestowed the luminous divine pearl and granted the radiant *zhaohua* jade. His brows and hair were of equal length, signifying the auspicious omen of his reign; his lifespan matched that of heaven, manifesting the glorious blessing of extended years. He discerned the sixteen ministers and employed the twenty-five officials, bringing the hundred lords into harmony as fish in water, and inspiring the myriad people to submit like ants drawn to sweetness. He transformed the numinous qi into celestial script, sparing the labor of brushwork, and wove auspicious clouds into a jeweled palace, requiring no human craft.\n\nWhen the Lord of Xia ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor aided the royal Dao, becoming the emperor’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of virtue and admonition, setting the model for the state. He combed through wind and rain, hewed through mountains and forests, completing the nine-year task of regulating the waters and fulfilling the fourfold duty of serving the king. Though his palace was humble and his chambers mean, he devoted himself to the work of ditches and canals; though his garments were tattered and his robes threadbare, he adorned himself with the rites of cap and sash. He guided the Majie River to rush like bamboo arrows and chiseled Dragon Gate to hasten the peach-blossom currents. He saved the multitudes from becoming fish and ensured the dry land would never become a sea. His breast cradled the jade Dipper, bearing the celestial patterns upon his person; his hands unfurled the jasper chart, holding the mandate of the state within himself.\n\nThus it is known: the Great Dao is the crown of the Three Teachings, and supreme virtue is the origin of the hundred sages. When the Lord of Tang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor temporarily departed the leftmost pole, descending to serve as the king’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of longevity and embodied the Dao of natural spontaneity, removing the three-sided nets and opening the one-eyed snares. Beasts fled far and were no longer ensnared; birds soared high and were not trapped. He summoned the myriad regions to blame himself, enumerating six faults to reproach his own conduct. He discoursed on the Eight Simplicities and Seven Perfections, expounded the Six Voids and Ten Secrets. The honey of the thousand-year peach blossoms surpassed crimson nectar in flavor; the greens of the ninefold blue leaves were drenched in rosy dew. Mounting the Three Luminaries, he turned swift as lightning; riding the Six Qi, he soared like mist. Gazing upon the sea, it seemed but a droplet; beholding Mount Song and Mount Heng, they appeared as silkworm cocoons and millet grains. Feasting on wind and drinking dew, he traversed the void and grasped the formless. He took the Ten Continents as his minor palaces and the Six Poles as his temporary lodgings. He drove the immortals of the middle realm and employed the lesser transcendents for trials. A single strand of white hair could lift a ten-thousand-*jin* stone; a few feet of green bamboo could transform into a hundred-*zhang* dragon. Those who attained it saw their seven ancestors ascend; those who lost it remained deluded in their single lifetime. It lies only in steadfast cultivation and careful practice, forsaking bitterness and forgetting toil—thus one may refine the Two Modes and moisten the Nine Lands.\n\nThe Green Ram Market, according to the *Annals*, was the site of the Supreme Dark-Primal Great Emperor’s second descent into the world. When the Yin Dao was obstructed and the Zhou virtue declined, the land-sea seethed and the hundred rivers surged; mountains roared and valleys howled, rain shrieked and wind wailed. He traversed the ages as dust in the historian’s records, then abandoned the pillar-scribe’s post to conceal his traces. Binding his robes, he departed the Wei Gate and crossed west through the Han Pass, riding a carriage drawn by a green ox in graceful turns, driving a white phoenix in carefree flight. Xu Jia held the reins as he followed the Transcendent Emperor in arrival; Yin Xi divined the winds and knew the Dao Lord must come. Though briefly parted, three thousand *jiazi* cycles had once made him a crimson youth; though reunited, eight hundred years of age now clung to the Yellow and the Old. Secretly he transmitted the wondrous formulas, silently he entrusted the subtle words, renewing the thousand-day covenant and reconvening the one-hour assembly.\n\nFor a moment he paid homage to the Primal Beginning, then ascended to the Heaven within Heaven. Forever he served his ancestral master, returning once more to the form beyond forms. He opened the Cold Numinous Elixir Palace, ascended the Jeweled Terrace of All Treasures, sat in the Purple-Gold Grove, and reposed upon the Azure-Jade Throne. The Transcendent Earl of Grand Clarity bore the star-embroidered brocade banner; the Transcendent Duke of Great Ultimate wielded the moon-bright spirit-summoning staff. All bowed their heads and prostrated, contemplating mind with mind.\n\nThereupon he summoned the Azure Lad of the Azure Emperor, transformed into a ram in the land of Shu, rode the purple clouds to the Purple Palace, and descended auspicious omens upon the royal chambers. The sound of his unceasing voice reached the newborn’s cry; in an instant, the infant’s wailing ceased. From the body of a crimson child he reverted to a white-haired elder. In a moment his stature exceeded ten feet; in an instant his face radiated fivefold light. Upon his head he wore a crown of the Seven Luminaries wrought in openwork; from his shoulders draped a nine-hued mantle of gossamer silk. His guards numbered beyond a hundred million; his transcendent retinue formed throngs. The assembled Perfected of the Ten Directions filled the vast expanse; the auspicious vapors of the Eight Extremities suffused the void. Fragrance wafted from the ninefold subtle flames; flowers drifted like six-pointed snow.\n\nAbout to depart Shu, he sought to transform the barbarian winds, journeying far to the Flowing Sands to reform the savage customs. In the lands of India and Kabul, he taught King Fan-tuo and King A-zhu, curbing their stubborn and perverse hearts, dispelling their intent to boil, burn, chisel, and pierce. When vast cauldrons seethed with bubbling water, he entered as though stepping into frozen springs; when pyres of piled wood blazed to the heavens, he sat as though enveloped in mist. Those who brandished white cudgels saw them as withered reeds; those who wielded red blades found them dull as lead. The armies of the Four Heavens advanced with thunderous clamor; the deities of ten thousand *li* shielded him, their power shifting mountains and rivers. The eighty kinds of Qiang and Rong submitted to pure transformation; the two thousand lands of fierce savagery forever abandoned their benighted ways.\n\nOnce customs were transformed and the Dao accomplished, he divided his body to become a buddha, aiding the Tathāgata’s thousand *kalpas* of merit; he descended in traces to become a master, relieving the king’s myriad affairs of state. As for the bronze armillary measuring the heavens and the jade calendar reckoning auspiciousness: when heaven’s seven, five, one, three, and nine cycles reached completion, and earth’s eight, six, two, four, and ten cycles attained fulfillment; when the disasters of the Nine Yangs were exhausted and the reckonings of the Hundred Sixes thoroughly probed—even in the eras of Fu Xi, Shen Nong, and the Yellow Emperor, none could escape these, nor could the courts of Gao Xin, Tang, and Yu avoid them.\n\nIn the first year of Guangming, the year *shangzhang* in the cycle, the month of the great clam, a great villain rose to fame in the imperial capital, and a chief brigand disturbed the kingdom’s course. Weapons entwined the nine wilds; all ministers counseled the emperor to inspect the provinces. Serpents arose in the land winds; the four peaks welcomed the imperial progress. The long whale gaped, its roar drinking the waters of Li and spouting those of Hao; the boar with tusks like swords charged the ranks of blades and awls. Before the gadflies could strike, they devoured the fat of our people; before the ants could be eradicated, they burrowed into the foundations of our towers. Dust shrouded the imperial canopy; bandits blocked the celestial thoroughfares.\n\nNine dragons drew the cloud chariot as the jade wheel turned west; ten thousand chariots circled the earth’s axis as the golden gates opened to the south. Crossing waters, the wave spirits bore the boat; ascending land, the earth deities escorted the imperial cortege. Within the Great Mystery City, a traveling palace manifested; beside the Brocade-Washing River, the main hall was temporarily established. Those bearing jade and silk numbered myriad states; those arrayed in ranks of mandarin ducks filled a thousand offices. The flocks of Goose Forest came to court; the Turtle Mountain loosed its moorings. The cities of Crane Marsh presented tribute; the elephant-drawn carriages of foreign kings arrived.\n\nAt the time when the Rong and Yi submitted in compliance, when the tracks of carts merged and the world was united—when the Miao people had not yet been pacified, requiring the aid of sagely counsel; when the Hu clan prolonged its punishment, relying on the strength of the imperial teacher—generals versed in the *Bear Stratagems* and *Leopard Stratagems* bowed to military merit; the Dragon-Horn and Ram-Horn mountains could trace their sacred omens. Twenty-eight transformations still rode the white deer to arrive; the hundred-six disasters must be met astride the azure steed to save.\n\nHe propped up the ancestral altars and aided the imperial descendants in secret. Crimson light blazed upon the palace halls, heralding the advent of Great Peace; purple vapors glowed upon the plum and bamboo, presaging supreme felicity. Examining these transformations, he illuminated their responses; tracing his numinous traces, he indeed obtained the solid rice. Above was an ancient seal-script inscription: *The Supreme Brings Peace, the Center Harmonizes Disasters.* Thereupon he verified the six characters, manifesting a hundred auspicious signs. Struck, it resounded like the cry of a phoenix; beheld, it resembled a vast jade disc. Through the ages of Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei, the jade script remained fresh; through the dynasties of Jin, Song, Liang, and Sui, the silver hooks showed no decay. Stored in layered caskets, sealed with utmost secrecy, it glorified the imperial enterprise and emblazoned the green histories.\n\nAs the years and generations stretched distant and the boundaries of fields shifted, the old site became overgrown with moss, the ancient altar lay in ruins. The immortal homeland and former abode now half belonged to common households; the remnants of the true realm’s winds lingered only in broken tiles and scattered rubble. Beneath the withered pines in the night moon, one might still hear the cries of dark cranes; amid the autumn grasses and evening mist, one could but listen to the echoes of thrushes in the sedge. The cloud caves of that time now sheltered foxes and hares; the mushroom fields of old had all grown millet and grain.\n\nPursuing afar the numinous traces, their wondrous proofs stood manifest. The Emperor specially issued a luminous edict to construct a sacred palace, bestowing upon both inner and outer courts two million strings of cash from the treasury to summon artisans and hasten the work. Thereupon the wood spirits delivered timber, and a nine-tiered towering structure arose; the earth deities offered soil, and a hundred walls simultaneously took form. The water lords advanced springs to fashion pools, while the mountain spirits hastened stones to lay foundations. Lofty cloud-piercing pavilions seemed to have sprung forth by transformation; the soaring Jade Mist Hall appeared as though newly risen from the earth. Eaves spread like wings, and beams pressed down like molted rainbows; plastered walls gleamed frost-white, and cinnabar pillars blazed like fire. Windows captured inverted reflections, and doors opened onto endless skies. Newly sculpted images took shape, their forms just descended, their expressions on the verge of speech, as if expounding the texts of the Five Thousand Words; their demeanor poised to depart, transforming scholars of the ten directions. Golden censers exuded fragrance, and jeweled parasols revolved. At first glimpse of the lamb emerging from its pen, one might still doubt its kneeling to nurse; at the initial sight of the horse white as silk, one could yet fear its neighing to the wind.\n\nThe courtyard, cleared of brambles, sprouted jade-like grasses anew; the garden, purged of weeds, burst forth with blossoms of jasper. Hills and mounds rose steeply, and towers and terraces stood grand and open. The halls of Qi’s round marshes and Wei’s square pools vied in splendor; the palace of the Transformed Man of the Western Limits stood in rivalry. Drawing in the numinous might of the Sword Pass, all converged at the imperial seat; gathering the radiant essence of Mount Emei, half entered the capital city. Smoke withered upon the azure altars, and wind carried the clear chimes of stone. Thus the Five Elders descended, and the Four Perfected all arrived. With a stroke upon the earth, rivers and lakes took form; with a pinch of soil, mountains and peaks arose. Seated, they summoned wind and rain, capable of overturning the Luo and upending the Yellow River; standing, they raised clouds and mist, able to reverse day into night. Transforming grasses and trees into armies, altering men and horses into groves, such a host could not be vanquished in a hundred battles; such a campaign against rebels could not be matched even by seven captures.\n\nThus when celestial calamities spread, they adhered to the principles of waxing and waning; when the cycles of fate ebbed and flowed, they accorded with the proper measures of fortune and misfortune. Zuo Ci summoned divine soldiers to lash and scatter bandits; Xu Xun commanded mighty warriors to sever and purge raging demons. Therefore, the hidden order of humanity was woven by ten thousand sages. At the cinnabar waters of Jiao Man, repeated offerings of sincere prayers bore fruit; at the Kunyang plains of Mu Ye, successive presentations of captured foes brought victory. Armor and weapons gleamed across the eight rivers, and encampments blocked the four suburbs. Battle formations stretched like clouds, and the din of war resounded like thunder. Blood spattered the sky and fell in crimson showers; sand swelled across the fields and drifted like yellow clouds. Cornered beasts snapped their fangs, and long serpents feared their tails. The people of Zheng and Cao fled in disarray; the tents of Chu stood utterly empty. Virtue balanced, righteous warriors gave their lives; qi unyielding, the royal army never aged. Day after day, the clamor of gongs and drums never ceased, yet no weariness was declared; year after year, iron armor was never doffed, yet no hardship was spoken.\n\nThereafter, the Phoenix City was restored to light, and the Dragon’s virtue shone resplendent. Crooked arrows upon the bowstring—what need for their piercing the moon? Long poles in hand—what purpose in their striking the heavens? Thus the thread of succession was repaired, and the raging rhinoceros was caged; the way of the martial waned, and the traitor’s head was severed by a loyal heart. Lu Shan’s fate was exhausted, and his belly was split by a gray-headed servant. Moreover, the rebellious nest had violated the celestial order, its perverse qi soaring to the skies. For seven or eight years, the chirping crickets gathered; for tens of thousands, the howling wolves assembled. The nine lands were ravaged, and the two capitals were violated. Yet by delaying punishment to spread the net of Heaven’s blessing and extending benevolent winds to temper execution, five years of stolen life were reclaimed, and all evil was eradicated in a single stroke. The tomb of Chi You was completed, his iron forehead buried deep; the throat of the Long Di was severed, and the carved halberds were forever stilled.\n\nSuch divine achievements truly relied upon the power of the Dao. Our Supreme Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Origin, Heavenly Sovereign, and Great Thearch—father and mother of Heaven and Earth, master and teacher of emperors and kings—has instructed the Three Sovereigns for eighteen thousand years, presiding over the four qi and harmonizing the five movements. Uniting with the positions of state, he eternally bestowed them upon his descendants. The sacred lineage, equal to the sun and moon, has continued the eighteen thousand years.\n\nOur High Ancestor, the Divine Yao Emperor, responded to Heaven’s mandate, bearing the mandate of fate within himself. Gazing upon the homeland, he departed not far from the immortal realm; embodying supreme virtue without claiming it, he augmented the imperial virtue to ever greater heights. Casting aside the nine vermilion tally tablets, he sealed mountains and stamped the seas; pursuing the eight transcendent chariots, he rolled through mists and wound through clouds. Bearing the banner of peace, he faced the sun and spread transformation.\n\nOur Emperor Taizong of Civil and Martial Virtue grasped Qian and unfolded Kun, cultivating culture and pacifying arms. Great ritual knew no bounds, yet in a hundred rites he exhausted their root and origin; great sound was without tone, yet in a single note he shook past and present. Heaven bestowed courage and wisdom, enabling him to bind tigers and leopards like bundled straw; divine aid strengthened the imperial might, allowing him to measure dragons and serpents like knotted worms. Returning to truth and reverting to simplicity, he wandered in art and abided in benevolence. Taking non-binding as binding, he bound the six heroes and five hegemons; taking non-vessels as vessels, he encompassed the four insults and the nine provinces. Thereafter, contending in non-contention, warfare forever ceased; desiring in non-desire, cravings forever vanished.\n\nMasters of the Dao gathered in throngs, and perfected lords arrived. The jujubes of An Qi took strange forms, as large as gourds; the cocoons of Yuan Ke assumed unusual shapes, piled like basins. Clad in robes for one hundred and fifty generations, he reigned for eighteen thousand years.\n\nWe now reverently consider Your Majesty, the Sagely, Divine, Wise, Benevolent, Enlightened, and Filial Emperor, who has inherited the great enterprise and unified this grand endeavor. Your heart hangs upon the Mirror of Longevity, and your body dwells in the Garden of Blessings. The imperial Dao revives at the center, and the roots of the state stand deep and firm. May you eternally safeguard the divine regalia and forever uphold the imperial order.\n\nThe Tiger’s Fang General commands eight thousand valiant warriors; the Dragon-Head Marshal leads a million crack troops, forever stabilizing the realm and forever pacifying the world. The giant turtle perished, its body blocking the seas; the long whale was slain, its warning fins piercing the heavens. Some were roasted, some burned, consuming the trees of a thousand mountains; some were boiled, some cooked, exhausting the springs of the five lakes. Purple flames reeked of blood and fat; green duckweed floated upon gore. Ominous suns fell, and comet stars plummeted; the azure canopy opened wide, and black qi vanished. The three heads of the great rebel were presented, and the nine ancestral temples of the imperial court were informed. Martial might shone through the ages, and a tower of skulls was erected upon the divine land.\n\nAs the years stretched beyond great pillars and the seasons surpassed vast floods, Heaven turned its gaze northward, preparing its divine crossbow to return to the court of Yao. The Emperor’s grace flowed eastward, borne upon a transcendent chariot to embrace the Wei watchtowers. He gathered the regional governors to bestow auspicious omens and summoned the feudal lords to the Hall of Light, reviving the lost and restoring the broken lineages.\n\nEight dragons descended in cloud-script, bearing celestial writ for Yu and Ji; the martial and sagely virtues of the Two Warriors illuminated the imperial power of Shang and Zhou. With the central steps leveled, the realm knew peace; with supreme virtue rightly aligned, the age flourished in harmony. Such divine merit in securing the sacred lineage arose from the sagely might of the Most High—his governance was but to sit upright in serene dignity, facing south in reverent stillness.\n\nThe Military Commissioner of Jiannan Xichuan, Grand Commandant and concurrently Chancellor, Prince of Yingchuan, Chen Jingyi—when the summer sun hung high, it blazed with awe-inspiring radiance; the star of virtue gathered eternally, its auspicious brilliance clearly marked. From afar, he breached the Turtle City to welcome the Dragon Chariot, offering a jade ladle to pour the great transformation as if turning the azure heavens, and relocating Penglai to serve as a traveling palace as though parting the blue sea. Guo Qi’s fans stirred the ranks, Qian Neng’s scratching shook the mountains and forests, Han Xiusheng amassed mosquitoes into thunder, and Yang Shigu piled fireflies to rival the sun.\n\nThose captured were bound like rats; those executed were slaughtered like sheep. A hundred beasts danced before the court, worthy of inscription on jade tablets; the Five Ding labored beneath his banner, capable of shattering iron mountains. Even the talents of Wen Qiao and Zhuge Liang, the strategies of Xiao He and Wang Jun, could not compare. Once, Wei Gao had governed Chengdu for over twenty years, and Guo Ziyi had served as chief minister for two decades—yet when measuring their merits and benevolent governance, a single year’s surplus of nine harvests would not have been deemed excessive. Chen’s governance in Jiannan eclipsed Pei Du’s triumph in Huai’xi, all recorded in the annals to eternally illuminate his achievements.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Presence, Left Divine Strategy Army Commander-in-Chief, and Ten Armies’ Military Supervisor, Tian Lingzi—like a jade pillar of Kunlun, he alone propped up the heavens; like a golden lotus of Mount Taihua, he held the sun in his heart. Born to aid the sagely and serve the state, his talents surpassed thousands and tens of thousands, his wisdom grasped ten from one. Warm and harmonious, he assisted the Blue Emperor in fostering life; lofty in spirit, he revered the teachings of the White King. Gazing upon the imperial tally, the Five Thieves all appeared; wielding the mirror of men, myriad phenomena could not escape. His hearing discerned the unspoken; his vision perceived the unformed. Assisting the times and establishing virtue, he founded a state and secured a household, dispensing rewards and punishments without bias. The feudal lords of the Nine Kingdoms cherished his grace; the generals and marshals of the Ten Armies pledged their loyalty. In self-restraint and sincerity, he devoted his heart to the Dao, so that ancient layered structures, when respected, differed not from cinnabar terraces; old rules and standards, when upheld, ascended like the white sun. He honored the supreme lord of rites and served the ceremonial Dharma King. Eight thousand divine beasts surged forth, while rhinoceroses and elephants seemed as ants; three hundred million heavenly soldiers turned seas and mountains like duckweed.\n\nHis achievements surpassed those of the Duke of Zhou, placing him first among men; his merits outshone those of the Marquis of Zheng, leaving none to rival him. Engraved upon tripods and bells, his virtues were extolled and his deeds recorded.\n\nThe Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs and concurrently Chancellor, Xiao Gou—his talents and learning were unparalleled, his spirit and brilliance spanned the ages. His literary sea subdued the waves of the Huai and lakes; his mountain of learning towered above the peaks of Heng and Huo. Heaven-endowed as the nation’s blessing, his literary grace nurtured his ministerial legacy. He rectified the imperial transformation with a single stroke and upheld the great balance with eightfold integrity. Within the bounds of his teaching, he deployed countless strategic marvels; within the steps of his jade tablet, he secured the multitudes of the realm. The yellow crane cried frequently, yet even the Duke of Shao could not restrain it; the blue ox never panted, its endurance as inscrutable as good fortune.\n\nThe Minister of Personnel and concurrently Chancellor, Wei Zhaodu—a vessel of the ancestral temple, a worthy minister of the altars of soil and grain. At his post, he shone like a star; at the court, he stood firm as a mountain. His virtue, like jade tablets, was uniquely eminent; his heart, like pine and bamboo, was steadfast and true. He grounded himself in the Six Classics, rectifying customs with elegance; he harmonized the flavors of salt and plum to enrich the Dao, strengthening state and household. Though he occupied the position of the Three Excellencies, he remained empty as the ninth rank; though he bore the name of the Eight Elders, he left it unclaimed.\n\nThe Minister of War and concurrently Chancellor, Pei Jie—a steed of blessing, a heavenly colt displaying its talents. His heroic integrity spanned the age; his pure wind cleansed the world. The Silver River spanned the sky in lofty clarity; the Jade Cord hung with celestial brilliance. His learning flowed like fourfold waves; his calligraphy resembled five pines in misty rain. His upright qi chilled the court and the wilds; his straight path threaded the sheep’s gut trail. Since assuming office in the imperial domain and rising in this illustrious age, he had twice grasped the oar of Fu Yue and twice wielded the scales of Gao Yao. All honed their wisdom’s blade to sever the waist of chaos, tempered their literary spear to pierce the belly of obstinacy.\n\nThe Inner Flying Dragon Commissioner, Yang Fugong—born of an armored lineage and a distinguished clan, his fame resounded through three teachings and his clarity flowed through the nine streams. In embodying things, he stood with Zhang and Que; in pure sentiment, he surpassed Bao and Xie. Among brothers, he was one of eight dragons stirring the clouds; in discourse on classics and history, he humbled the five deer. Holding the pivot of governance through successive generations, his illustrious name spanned a hundred schools. Endowed with the immortal bearing of Wu Jizha and the quick wisdom of Kong Wenzi, his green mountains cradled jade, radiating light from every peak; his green waters held pearls, casting crystalline brilliance across the river.\n\nThe Inner Privy Councilor and Grand Chancellor with Equal Rank to the Three Dukes, Tian Yunli—his four virtues matched his position; the five stars blazed with his spirit. His purity surpassed the jade pot; his righteousness outweighed golden promises. His wisdom, round as the moon, ever lent its light to the sun; his eloquence, flowing as a river, ever replenished the king’s sea. Upright in qi and steadfast in heart, warm and reverent, he possessed the grand talents of a king’s aide and the weighty vessel of an emperor’s minister. At the axis, his body aligned with the earth’s foundations; at the pivot, his hand corrected the heavens’ patterns. A longtime observer of the Daoist gate, he revered the true teachings with white silk and plain speech. Though his words were not embellished, he always spoke with forthright sincerity; though his Dharma language was venerable, it ever accorded with the principles of peace.\n\nThe Internal Privy Councilor and Cavalry General-in-Chief Li Shunrong emerged as one of the three prodigies, his brilliance outshining a thousand mountains; his nobility rivaled the loftiness of Yuan Li’s Dragon Gate, and his blessings extended to his worthy descendants. In youth, his stature equaled the crane-borne carriage of Shao Jun, his fortune nurturing the sacred lineage. Entrusted with the secrets of ten thousand affairs, he succored the people of an entire realm. His clarity was such that the water-mirror held emptiness; his uprightness so pure that the crimson plumb-line yielded its beauty. His erudition rivaled the achievements of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors, while his integrity in adversity wove brocade into literary splendor. With a full belly, he guarded solemnity, casting a hundred cares from his breast; with an empty heart, he received all things, embracing the distant and wild within his square-inch mind.\n\nThe Military Inspector and General of the Biaoqi Division, concurrently Commissioner of the Three Rivers, Liu Jingxuan, bore auspicious signs from past lives, his clouds of fortune unfolding in radiant hues. His bearing was peerlessly noble, his talent and capacity vast and profound. Like the jade branch of the King of Southern Yue, his phoenix soared near; like the orchid companion of the Old Man of the River, his crane’s flight was not far. His diligence in aiding and protecting was unceasing, his meritorious deeds forever inscribed.\n\nThe Right Street Majestic Daoist Master Yin Siguan, a divine immortal of towering lineage, descended from flourishing branches. He was the true heir of the Supreme Lord of Mysterious Origin and the wise descendant of the Perfected Lord of Wen Shi. At seven, he awakened to the Dao; at thirteen, he met his master. His bones, near-perfected as purple jade, would one day wander the Boarded Garden; his mastery of the Yellow Writ complete, he ascended to the Vermilion Mound. The Daoist Li Wuwei, of national origin and celestial lineage, dwelt in the fragrant shade of heaven. He delved into a thousand layers of true secrets, mastering all; he perused ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, leaving none unread. Together in their master’s gate, they forged bonds as Daoist companions. In the second heaven’s phoenix cocoon, they refined spiritual qi into script; with dragon pellets of grain, they preserved youthful countenances to transcend kalpas. Adorned in starry crowns and moonlit robes, they paid homage to the Primal Emperor; mounted on rainbow reins and cloud chariots, they faced the Great Emperor. Five *hu* of golden silkworms secretly spun immortal threads; a pair of jade tablets distantly welcomed true hymns.\n\nSince ancient times, loyal ministers and enlightened sovereigns have governed the realm to ascend to heaven, responding to the rhythms of destiny to save their age, reviving the living and completing their works. Shao Hao and Zhuanxu both ascended to the Purple Tenuity Palace; Jun Shi and the Grand Duke together rode the azure mists. Their palaces and chambers, terraces and ponds, seemed formed from clouds and mist, as if painted in cinnabar and blue. The seventy-two blessed lands and thirty-six grotto-heavens, the interconnected abodes of immortals—with Mount Qingcheng as their doors and windows, the winds and mists of true scenes untainted—with Mount Pan as their altars, could ferry the four deluded and propagate the seven divisions. Immortal robes, though unstitched, were naturally complete, needing no needle and thread; immortal carriages, though unharnessed, moved of themselves, leaving no wheel tracks. In the ninefold heavens, white jade formed the capital; within the thousand-*zhi* walls, yellow gold built the halls. Clad in a single garment, they hung the sun and moon upon their bodies; crowned with ceremonial tassels, they sat amidst heaven and earth. The celestial net was rectified, the four qi harmonized; the nation’s steps were secure, the three primals ordered. In hand, they held the handle of longevity, shaping the white colt; in heart, they concealed the root of the essential Dao, riding the red carp.\n\nMoreover, as eras shifted and times changed across three thousand years, as states were founded and nations established for over forty thousand years, new gates and lanes arose, and the thriving populace flourished. Though the gates of that time were closed, the hairpins and topknots remained as if present; though the palace courts of today were newly built, their splendor surpassed the old. Flocks of seven-colored phoenixes frequently arrived in their carriages; nine-spotted dragon chariots reverently made their rounds. The Celestial Mansion of the Great Void kept its ever-open, sleepless gates; the Infinite Blessing Hall forever faced the scene of eternal spring. Their qi connected with the azure vault; their light outshone the Red City.\n\nThis minister, unworthy though he is of the imperial forest, has presumptuously enjoyed the role of a literary retainer. He has waded the Confucian sea but found his learning shallow; crossed the river of letters but found his depth lacking. The five-colored gnats of Dong Zhongshu rarely alight upon his brush; the threefold purity of Yang Xiong seldom graces his brush-tip. Ashamed of his lack of Huang Xiang’s talent, he struggles to record the purple mists of auspicious omens.\n\nAn ode says:\n\nAt the dawn of the vast origin, kalpas stretched boundless.\nIn the dim and distant, the great Dao appeared—elusive, formless, beyond the reach of emperors.\nThe Primordial Beginning then withdrew; the Primordial Commencement followed in its wake.\nThe Mysterious One, the Yellow within the shell, where clear and turbid had yet to part.\nBefore heaven and earth, ten million years had passed.\nMountains, though older than I, fade like lightning’s flash;\nseas, though vaster than I, shrink to threads of silk.\nCompared with the Buddha’s teachings, the Gate of Emptiness stands forever closed;\nmatched against Confucian achievement, the ritual cap holds no sway.\nYet virtue shines bright, blocking all transgression; disputes dissolve, and sophistry is crushed.\n\nTeachings adapt to the moment, responding to change without hindrance.\nThe Three Sovereigns grew ever wiser; the Five Emperors deepened in sagacity.\nAll under heaven knew peace; every living being found deliverance.\nThe Louguan Temple set forth its wheels; at Hangu Pass, the carriage’s traces were hung.\nTaming the wild tribes and spreading transformation, extending poison’s cure and bestowing grace.\nFormless form, soundless sound—\nno farewell could send it off, no welcome could greet its coming.\nForced to name the unnameable, we call it by a name;\nforced to label the unlabelable, we give it a label.\nAbove the Great Void, gold forms the city walls;\nbeyond the boundless dark, white jade builds the capital.\nResplendent across the six directions, embracing the eight cords of heaven,\nall nations drink as one, all grains pour forth in harmony.\nNone can exhaust it; none can fill it.\nThose who tread the shallow path dwell long in prosperity and integrity;\nthose who delve deep attain eternal great peace.\n\nFierce and blazing, its vital qi transforms into celestial warriors;\nlush and vigorous, its stalwart grasses become divine soldiers.\nFire-bright blades flash like lightning; frost-edged swords gleam like rainbows.\nThe monstrous boar is slaughtered; the giant whale is split like a melon.\nAncient lands see their winds transformed; customs flourish.\nThe times grow pure.\nAges stretch distant; years stand lofty and towering.\nThe new palace is built, its completion to be observed for all time.\n\nRadiant, the High Ancestor; illustrious, the sagely grandson.\n\nCarving creation’s marrow, the sword pares primordial chaos.\nSeizing sun and moon, enfolding heaven and earth.\nPhoenix-tracks and phoenix-poems, tiger-strides and dragon-crouches.\nWithin the egg of the crow, the vault of heaven may be contained;\nwithin a grain of millet, Mount Kunlun may be concealed.\nDust-waves settle clear; wisdom’s waves plumb the abyss.\nIllusions unravel of themselves; the polished mirror never dims.\nAll phenomena vanish away—only the Dao abides alone.\nThe Three Teachings vie for precedence—only the Dao stands supreme.\nThe heart harbors the Five Thieves; the realm quiets the Nine Gates.\nVerdant and billowing, the admonitory mist; vast and drifting, the crossroads altar.\nThe Five Quarters bring tribute; the Eight Extremes race to arrive.\nChariots and foot-soldiers crowd like river-mist; taxes and levies mass like clouds.\nTowering, the Jade Emperor; resplendent, the Golden Register.\nDivine officers patrol the Eight Seas; the Water Bureau guards the Four Floods.\nYao and Tang’s sacred thrones, Shun and Yu’s celestial emoluments.\nThe monstrous bandit is exterminated; the divine realm is restored.\nA thousand spirits are summoned; a hundred blessings converge.\nHeaven’s azure wheel turns; earth’s yellow hub revolves.\nTen jades of jade are offered; the Nine Provinces present gold.\nCold and heat pursue their course; auspicious omens intertwine.\nHarm is strangled by the blade; the raging rhinoceros is sheathed in arrows.\nThe Han mirror is grasped; the Yin plumb-line is set to the timber.\nNine-tiered towers of jasper; five bushels of silver silkworms.\nA hand points to the green ox; a body rides the white deer.\nThe cavern of Kuo Cang opens; the Heavenly King’s House is revealed.\nThe imperial root, the nation’s branch; the emperor’s clan, the celestial lineage.\nThe Hall of Light stands in solemn dignity; the chief minister offers wise counsel.\nThe Four Seas and ten thousand regions—none fail to submit.\nA single rainbow arches gracefully; twin phoenixes wheel in flight.\nThe crane-chariot ascends the Milky Way; the simurgh soars through purple mist.\nA hundred deeds accumulate; a thousand merits are fulfilled.\nThe cinnabar-jade tower soars, touching the Nine Heavens;\nthe azure-jade altar rises steeply, the Eight Immortals descend.\nBeyond the great expanse lie the Isles of Peng; dragons plow the fields of magic mushrooms.\nEarth possesses the Way of Humility—eastward flow the myriad rivers.\nMan dwells in the Power of the Supreme—southward rule the host of worthies.\nThe Well of Great Life, the Spring of Eternal Longevity.\nExtending the sacred succession, for eighteen thousand years.\nThe crane is not stained by immersion; the crow is not dyed black.\nThus it is in spontaneity; thus it is in self-attainment.\nHow to dispel ignorance? Discern delusion within.\nHow to awaken enlightenment? Cultivate the pattern within.\nLike the chariot’s south-pointing needle; like the stars’ circling the North.\nManifestation and concealment are impermanent; transformation is unfathomable.\nThe Great Image is hard to encompass; the Two Modes grow ever more confined.\nGreat wisdom is hard to unfold; the Six Directions shrink narrow.\nThe handle of long life; the realm of eternal longevity.\nAt dawn, ingest the elixir-spoon; by dusk, sprout wings.\nThe temple offers the Three Tremblings; the winds purify ten thousand lands.\nThe numinous observatory is personally constructed; the host of immortals arrives in attendance.\nPalaces of jasper, jewel-studded terraces; jade texts and golden tablets.\nMonumental steles stand like mountains; giant tortoises press close.\nThe words are only of praise and beauty; the prose is not mere exaggeration.\nPhoenixes and cranes perch and crouch; dragons and serpents leap and prance.\nPurple qi swirls and billows; crimson light glows and reddens.\nThe Seven Sages grasp the charts; the Nine August Ones wield the kalpas.\nThe Buddhist monasteries grow more radiant; the Confucian halls shine forth.\nCrowned and robed, they ascend the Hall of Light; trailing banners, they govern the throne.\nTheir destiny equals that of the Three and Five; their blessings extend for ten thousand millions.\nThe opened and partitioned world—all look up to the Dao and its Power.\nEternal attainment of the Middle Revival—all derive from the emperor’s might.\n\nMinister, entrusted with the imperial command, composes the stele inscription for the Green Ram Palace. Reverently considering the Most High Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal, the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Dao, the ancestral founder of the Supreme Power, who emerged before heaven and earth and endures after them, who roams through the Five Kalpas and traverses a thousand myriad years: of old, at the Green Ram Market, the divine traces of the white deer appeared. Purple qi swirled and billowed; crimson light blazed and glowed. Numinous meals and jade talismans eternally marked the Middle Revival. Ninety thousand immortals all stood under his command; three hundred million warriors all dwelt within his service. Thus he could move heaven and earth, shift seas and mountains, transform fish and turtles into soldiers, slay the bronze-headed foe, change armies into groves, bury iron cavalry. Supporting the sacred destiny, aiding the royal armies in secret, he annihilated the ringleaders, swept clean the cosmos, hung the heads of the Three Villains, offered the might of the Nine Temples, perfected the imperial enterprise, and eternally pacified the nation’s course.\n\nYour minister, kneeling to receive the sagacious decree and reverently obeying the imperial benevolence, though his learning is shallow and his knowledge scant, has composed these crude words. The stele inscription is now completed; respectfully, he submits it herewith for consideration.\n\nMemorial submitted by Yue Penggui, Hanlin Academician and Acting Minister of War.\n\nThe Central Secretariat and Chancellery address the Military Commissioner of West Sichuan: By imperial decree: The Golden Portal bestows auspicious omens; purple qi bridges the Pass of Salvation. The jade altar conceals wondrous signs; crimson light surges forth from the earth’s script. Of old, a mysterious talisman remained in ancient seal-script. At midnight, dragons and serpents stirred; the Six Characters shone in splendor. A year later, the wolfish rebels were pacified; the Eight Cords knew no strife. The numinous efficacy was thus revealed; the Middle Revival was inaugurated. Examining the subtle words of the imperial ancestor, manifesting the divine merit in this glorious era—should it not be inscribed at a Daoist abbey, carved in Shu’s mountains, to flow through a thousand myriad years and record our eighteen generations?\n\nYue Penggui, whose office is that of Inner Academician and who ranks foremost among the close ministers, has wielded his golden brush with marvelous skill, engraving it upon another mountain’s stone. His exposition is flawless; even Cai Yong would have marveled at his foresight. His composition leaves nothing unaddressed; even Cao Zhi would have found no need for solitary insight. It is fitting to carve this grand affair to authenticate this text. You are hereby ordered to erect it at the abbey in question. Upon receipt of this decree, act accordingly.\n\nMemorial dated the eighth day of the ninth month, the fourth year of Zhonghe.\n\nThe stele inscription for the Green Ram Palace of West Sichuan is hereby concluded.",

      "translated_text": "**Inscription on the Stele of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Brick Inscription of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu*\n*Composed by:* Yue Penggui of the Tang Dynasty\n*One fascicle.*\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Records and Biographies* section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n**Inscription on the Stele of Qingyang Palace in Western Shu**\nComposed by Yue Penggui, Grand Academician of the Hanlin Academy, Senior Grand Master for Court Audiences, Acting Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, Pillar of State, and Recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag.\n\nOf old, the eighty-one heavens correspond to half the lifespan of the Most High; six million years mark the initial years of the Primordial Beginning. The Dao, vast and boundless, is difficult to fathom; its essence, subtle and formless, defies inquiry. It dwells beyond form and image, before the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity. When the kalpas of Dragon Han had twice renewed and the records of Phoenix Epochs were yet unestablished, it concealed its sprouts within the boundless void and hid its roots and trunk in the primal deluge.\n\nTwo deities, bearing the cosmos upon their backs, arrived together, carving open creation. The Three Qi intermingled and advanced, the undifferentiated chaos dispersing into primordial matter. Dark and yellow flowed yet uncoagulated; pure and turbid divided and suddenly congealed. Within the realm of sun, moon, and stars, numinous palaces took form; amid rivers, plains, mountains, and peaks, grotto-heavens emerged.\n\nThus, the Dao is the ancestor of the myriad qi, and virtue is the origin of the hundred things. It takes the Two Modes and the Two Luminaries as its descendants, the Five Phases and Four Images as its branches and leaves. When the great inception first commenced and the Purple Ultimate later took shape, gazing upward, its height knew no limit; examining its summit, no higher could be found. The Eight Lords with hoary heads witnessed the time before heaven and earth existed; the Nine Elders with white brows beheld the era when heaven and earth first arose.\n\nDelving into the principles of the utmost truth and attaining the origin of the Great Dao, the realms of the immortals extend endlessly, and the lifespans of superior scholars grow ever more distant. Six thousand springs are but two months—still they sigh at the fleeting nature of life; seventy thousand years are but two years—yet they lament the brevity of existence.\n\nThe wise perceive it as wisdom; the benevolent perceive it as benevolence. Harmonizing its light, all radiance is but transient; blunting its edge, all drills and awls shatter. The Mystic Pearl is not to be grasped from below; the true unhewn jade bears no flaw.\n\nThose who learn and thereby know it are middling; those who know it by birth are supreme. The Three Lords and Five Elders regard the multitudes as fermenting wine; the Seven Sages and Nine August Ones see the common folk as straw dogs. Warming a thousand ages, all is dissolved like ice; accomplishing myriad virtues, all flows like a spring.\n\nUtmost clarity appears obscure—yet when the obscure is questioned, all matters are illuminated. Utmost skill appears clumsy—yet within clumsiness, all things are accomplished. Acting through non-action, it is useful in its uselessness. Rejecting the palate’s delight in the five flavors, blocking the ear’s acuity to the eight sounds, forgetting images and words, one easily sheds the sandals of a single moment. Without bolts, the gate is closed; with difficulty, the gate to the myriad wonders is opened.\n\nNinety thousand spirit immortals gather within the pore of a single hair; three thousand Confucian guards lie desolate at the tip of a unicorn’s horn. Thus, the two gates of Dao and Confucianism share the same warp and weft. Establishing purity and stillness as governance, embodying emptiness and non-being as the teacher.\n\nAbove, heaven serves as the wheel of the great chariot; the constellations serve as its spokes. It is harnessed to the horses of Qian, drawn by the oxen of Kun. It transports the merit of non-action, bearing and sustaining the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nRadiant yet not dazzling, it nurtures correctness within obscurity. Simple yet incorruptible, it cultivates truth within narrow confines. It cannot be distanced—separated from it, it is not far; it cannot be drawn near—employed, it grows ever more distant.\n\nNeither retreating to yield nor advancing to seek, the man who wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within is beauty upon beauty. The scholar who seeks the formless pearl—where shall he find it?\n\nShifting worlds into a gourd, one swallows the room of a fangzhang; shrinking the earth’s form into a sleeve, one conceals the city of Rajagrha. The root of the Dao, cultivated, becomes the foundation of heaven; the uncarved block of namelessness marks the origin of transformation.\n\nThree thousand rules of deportment are reverently observed in the teachings of the literary wind; five hundred precepts and practices are solemnly purified within the gates of the Śākya clan. Stretching heaven as a bow, it is tuned with yin and yang, cold and heat. The straight Dao is like an arrow, propelled by spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\n\nA single man uses it without exhausting it; the myriad people use it without depletion. The caves of the sun and moon conceal the body, once dwelling in caverns; the southern and northern darknesses skirt the edges, briefly roaming the watery abodes.\n\nPeach Blossom Spring and Penglai Isle have existed from ancient times to the present; the Scholarly Market and the Dim Altar are seen flourishing at dawn and dusk. The secret charts of immortality have been transmitted thrice over five thousand years; the numinous Dao of the sages appears once in a hundred thousand years.\n\nThose who study it with ease are like twisting stone to make rope; those who seek it with arrogance are like drilling ice to await fire. Abandoning skill and forsaking profit, it reveals the subtle and elucidates the obscure. Within the palaces of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui, officials dwell as feathered guests; within the Dipper of east, west, south, and north, immortals reside as true transcendents.\n\nThe body rides the chariot of virtue, its wheels turning beyond the primordial chaos; the hand holds the handle of longevity, directing all before the unfolding of creation. Serene and without striving, tranquil and self-content, transforming what is not transformed, all transformations are accomplished; giving life to what is not born, all living things attain fulfillment.\n\nWith an empty heart, it awaits all things; with a broad mind, it receives the seasons. Hiding Mount Tai within a autumn hair’s tip—yet the hair remains vast; containing Kunlun within a millet grain—yet the grain remains spacious.\n\nThe great image is without form—thus the Five Peaks are empty and silent; the great trust requires no pact—thus the four seasons proceed in wordless motion. The teachings of the true lineage are all accomplished; the merit of non-governance grows ever more manifest.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Golden Gates, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Emperor—he is the exalted ancestor of our Great Tang. According to the *Discourses of the States*, from the seventh year of King Ping of Zhou to the Sacred, Civil, Divine, and Martial Emperor of the Kaiyuan era, he is the thirty-sixth sagely descendant.\n\nHis illustrious radiance, like the sun’s sprouts, casts shade beneath all heaven; his luminous virtue, like the leaves of the state, bestows fragrance upon the shores of the realm.",

      "translated_text": "When the hidden depths first unfolded, the nine qi steamed and stirred without cease; the mysterious transformation spread wide, the six voids flowed and turned without rest. Establishing the gate of the non-dual teaching, he examined the root of the True One. The vast wind blew across the sea, three revolutions reduced the world to flying dust; the kalpa-fire consumed the mountains, five cycles leveled them to flat earth. First he wandered in the Blue Eon—when the Blue Eon had run its course, later he emerged and vanished in the Red Radiance—when the Red Radiance too was complete.\n\nNinety-nine myriad billion years were stored in a pellet; five thousand five hundred layered heavens were concealed within an eggshell. At the time when High Ancestor Tang of Yin ascended the throne, when King Wen of Zhou first unfolded the *Yi*, divine radiance flowed into the jade womb, auspicious splendor knit into golden bones. Unsplit, unsevered, he gestated for more than eighty years; descending blessings and omens, he surpassed the span of twenty thousand days. His feet trod the principle of imperishability, his hands grasped the writ of long life. He embraced Qian and enfolded Kun, seized the sun and grasped the moon. His brow bore the stars of Shen and Wu, his crown upheld the round vault; his ears opened the Three Gates, his nose stood as twin pillars. His blood was white, his brain purple; his liver azure, his spleen green. His nape drew forth thirty-five rays, his teeth held forty-eight cowries. Seven-hued blue lotuses followed his steps, a thousand-year white deer presented their felicity.\n\nThough mulberry fields changed, the twin cypresses never withered; though rivers ran dry, the nine wells never failed. In the village of Lai in Ku County, numinous traces endure; on the banks of Wo Spring in Chen State, divine footprints do not fade. Seven hundred disciples pointed to Fusang as their old grove; the Nine-Five Lord opened the Sun Palace as his former abode.\n\nTracing his primordial beginning, examining that earliest origin, he looked down upon the darkness before the Dark Ford, gazed below into the chaos after the Primal Undifferentiated. Adapting his teaching to the moment, he became the model for the Nine Ancients; responding to change without fixed method, he set the pattern for a hundred kings.\n\nWhen the year began with Sheti, inaugurating the signs of qi, thirteen sages ascended the throne, fulfilling the chart of eighteen thousand years. Our Most High Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor answered the moment and descended in manifestation, serving as teacher to the Heavenly Sovereign. At the first opening of the Upper Purity and Lower Turbidity, the separation was not distant; at the sudden rending of the Six Directions and Eight Cords, the division was not far. He set right the forms of square and round, above and below; he determined the state of vast primeval simplicity. Rivers newly melted yet waters remained murky; mountains first congealed yet stones were not yet firm. He sowed the white elms of heaven, which first sprouted in rows; he planted the green osmanthus of the moon, which just then grew in clusters. He matched the Four Seas to the Four Spirits, entrusted the Five Phases to the Five Emperors.\n\nAt that time, the image of Qian still hung low, the form of Kun remained thin. Establishing the pole and fixing positions, he spread transformation and built merit. Our Most High Sage Ancestor condescended to descend, serving as teacher to the Earthly Sovereign. Allotting hard and soft, he instituted cold and heat; the earth grew broader and thicker, the sky higher and brighter. His sagely power was unfathomable, his divine work inscrutable. Ten thousand trees split their husks, ten thousand grasses hooked their sprouts. Feathered flocks and furred herds were distinguished in the positions of Dui and Li; shelled creatures and scaled kinds were divided in the palaces of Kan and Zhen. The waters of the Four Directions were all empty—fish and turtles not yet born; the forms of the Five Peaks were all still—clouds and mist not yet exhaled.\n\nHaving passed the years of the Clear Sea, he departed from the age of the Clear Sea. When the Two Sages had governed, the Four Quarters shone with light. Our Most High Sage Ancestor broadly bestowed and saved the multitude, serving as teacher to the Human Sovereign. The three hundred sixty rivers first divided their veins; the eleven thousand five hundred stalks just then matched odd and even. The gods of Three Ren and Three Yi departed the womb of water and wood; the generals of Six Bing and Six Xin emerged from the gestation of fire and wind. For one hundred fifty-six generations, forty-five thousand years, he was first called Master of the Mysterious Dao, then titled Lord Emperor of the Golden Gates. His three names were Master Pan Gu.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor, to broadly save with the Dao, descended in manifestation as his teacher. Gazing up at the patterns of the round canopy, looking down at the principles of the square earth, he taught him to draw the Eight Trigrams, instructed him in the division of the Three Powers. He aided him in creating written characters to replace knotted cords, in establishing governance to succeed the age of tying knots. The *Three Ritual Classics* and *Five Canons* issued from him, the classics and scriptures arose from him. In hunting and fishing, he took the image of the bright Li; in the first and second divinations, he employed the work of the issuing Zhen. Phoenixes presented auspices in the imperial court; the dragon-horse bore the chart on the Yellow and Luo Rivers. He reigned for eighteen thousand years.\n\nWhen Lianshan ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor, to save the age, humbled himself and descended as imperial teacher. He entrusted him with the Five Movements, divided for him the Four Seasons. He aided him in ordering the ten thousand affairs, enlightened him in distinguishing the hundred grains. He transformed the age of drinking blood and eating raw flesh, shifted the sound of earthen drums and clay chimes. He destroyed caves and burned nests, raised beams above and built eaves below. He smelted metal and molded clay, cooked millet and split piglets. He fashioned plows to aid the multitudes, made pottery to benefit the myriad things. Heaven rained grain to present auspices, earth sprouted crops to display abundance. People ate fine grains, mountains produced tools and chariots.\n\nWhen the Lord of Youxiong ruled all under heaven, our Most High Sage Ancestor concealed himself within Kongtong, released his mind beyond the distant dark. The emperor personally descended in his carriage, offering rites to honor the teacher-disciple bond. He hastened to the corner in tattered robes, then bent his knees to inquire of the Dao. At that time, the tyrant of Yu Gang oppressed, Chiyou rebelled. He transformed fish and turtles into soldiers to aid the royal army, changed clouds and mist into spirits to secretly assist the battle lines. He ended war at Zhuolu, stilled weapons at Banquan. He bound the roaming to the land of Qingqiu, reached north to the scene of Hongti. He received the cinnabar scriptures at Wangwu, ascended the azure void at Dinghu. The bending plant sprouted, the divine beans reappeared—if not for the Great Dao, who could achieve this?\n\nWhen the Lord of Jintian ruled all under heaven, inheriting the source of the Ji River and the records of Xiong Mountain, he announced to heaven and emulated the emperor, drilling into the thread to uphold the texts.",

      "translated_text": "Our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor descended in a chariot drawn by nine dragons, assuming the role of teacher and styled as Master of the Great Ultimate. He expounded the canons of solemn reverence, instructing in the rites of aligning with the seasons and welcoming the qi, luminously matching the numinous powers, honoring the Six Ancestral Spirits, and conducting sacrifices to the host of sacred sites. With ceaseless diligence and awe, he attained the proper measure of ritual. The feathered tribes displayed their auspiciousness, and he appointed them to govern as the Avian Officials, distributing the Nine Birds to oversee the hundred bureaus. Radiance conjoined with jade to manifest numinosity, and the phoenix bore the celestial chart in proclamation—all through the supreme Dao, which revealed this imperial design.\n\nWhen the High Lord of Yang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor taught him to resolve conflicts and unblock obstructions, to govern the state and pacify the people. He swept away the Nine Li tribes, illuminating the Eight Virtues. There were the savage brutes with wild purple beards, the chieftains with serpentine bodies and crimson hair—so mighty they uprooted Mount Buzhou, their heads shattering the peaks. Heaven tilted to the northwest, causing the sun and moon to course westward; earth sank in the southeast, making the rivers and seas flow eastward. He summoned the Six Jia spirits, commanded the hundred numina, instructing them in the subtle-worded scriptures and teaching them the Dao of Great Compliance. Mounting a swift chariot of dark rainbow, he journeyed to the hidden mounds; riding a pale-glass carriage, he roamed afar to the coiled trees. Beholding our immortal catalpa, which blooms but once in ten thousand years, and gazing upon our sacred gourd, which bears fruit but once in four kalpas.\n\nWhen the High Lord of Xin ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor spread the Dao and disseminated transformation, aiding the age as its teacher. He discoursed on the wondrous words of the *Huangting*, concealing the sun and eluding the moon; he proclaimed the auspicious titles of the celestial charts, shifting cities and relocating settlements. He established the names of the Nine Provinces, composed the *Six Elegances* music, enfeoffed Goumang to assist the Azure Emperor, and summoned Rushou to aid the White Realm. He sealed Mount Tai with golden mud, illuminating the entire realm as if unveiling a jade mirror. He drank from the Well of Great Vitality, wandered the Land of Unending Day, anointed himself with the grease of the green simurgh to sustain the ranks of lesser immortals, and carved the flesh of the yellow qilin to serve as delicacies for exalted guests.\n\nWhen the Lord of Tao and Tang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor briefly bestowed the perfect principles, descending to serve as teacher. He expounded the scriptures of mysterious virtue to rectify the profound transformation, responding to the auspicious name of Crimson Mound in hopes of joining the ranks of Crimson Mound. Gentle and harmonious, the clear breeze made no sound at Wutiao; radiant and joyful, the yellow-haired elders were heard playing the *jiqiang* game. Meat and jerky in the kitchens grew of their own accord, rendering seasonings superfluous; sweet springs welled forth in the valleys, rendering fermentation useless. He opened the Four Gates to extend the Fourfold Wisdom, established the Five Affairs, and disseminated the Five Teachings. Donning a deer-fur robe, he ate oysters to assuage hunger; seated upright upon the earthen steps, he composed his thoughts. Wearing a crane-feather cloak, he drank the flowing rosy clouds, meditating in the Jasper Gardens.\n\nWhen the Lord of Yu ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor discoursed on the principle of non-action and expounded the scriptures of separation and union. The Three Miao tribes were subdued, the Four Offenders all submitted. The hundred offices followed their seasons, and the Five Canons were observed with care. He bestowed the luminous divine pearl and granted the radiant *zhaohua* jade. His brows and hair were of equal length, signifying the auspicious omen of his reign; his lifespan matched that of heaven, manifesting the glorious blessing of extended years. He discerned the sixteen ministers and employed the twenty-five officials, bringing the hundred lords into harmony as fish in water, and inspiring the myriad people to submit like ants drawn to sweetness. He transformed the numinous qi into celestial script, sparing the labor of brushwork, and wove auspicious clouds into a jeweled palace, requiring no human craft.\n\nWhen the Lord of Xia ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor aided the royal Dao, becoming the emperor’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of virtue and admonition, setting the model for the state. He combed through wind and rain, hewed through mountains and forests, completing the nine-year task of regulating the waters and fulfilling the fourfold duty of serving the king. Though his palace was humble and his chambers mean, he devoted himself to the work of ditches and canals; though his garments were tattered and his robes threadbare, he adorned himself with the rites of cap and sash. He guided the Majie River to rush like bamboo arrows and chiseled Dragon Gate to hasten the peach-blossom currents. He saved the multitudes from becoming fish and ensured the dry land would never become a sea. His breast cradled the jade Dipper, bearing the celestial patterns upon his person; his hands unfurled the jasper chart, holding the mandate of the state within himself.\n\nThus it is known: the Great Dao is the crown of the Three Teachings, and supreme virtue is the origin of the hundred sages. When the Lord of Tang ruled all under heaven, our Most Supreme and Sacred Ancestor temporarily departed the leftmost pole, descending to serve as the king’s teacher. He expounded the scriptures of longevity and embodied the Dao of natural spontaneity, removing the three-sided nets and opening the one-eyed snares. Beasts fled far and were no longer ensnared; birds soared high and were not trapped. He summoned the myriad regions to blame himself, enumerating six faults to reproach his own conduct. He discoursed on the Eight Simplicities and Seven Perfections, expounded the Six Voids and Ten Secrets. The honey of the thousand-year peach blossoms surpassed crimson nectar in flavor; the greens of the ninefold blue leaves were drenched in rosy dew. Mounting the Three Luminaries, he turned swift as lightning; riding the Six Qi, he soared like mist. Gazing upon the sea, it seemed but a droplet; beholding Mount Song and Mount Heng, they appeared as silkworm cocoons and millet grains. Feasting on wind and drinking dew, he traversed the void and grasped the formless. He took the Ten Continents as his minor palaces and the Six Poles as his temporary lodgings. He drove the immortals of the middle realm and employed the lesser transcendents for trials. A single strand of white hair could lift a ten-thousand-*jin* stone; a few feet of green bamboo could transform into a hundred-*zhang* dragon. Those who attained it saw their seven ancestors ascend; those who lost it remained deluded in their single lifetime. It lies only in steadfast cultivation and careful practice, forsaking bitterness and forgetting toil—thus one may refine the Two Modes and moisten the Nine Lands.",

      "translated_text": "The Green Ram Market, according to the *Annals*, was the site of the Supreme Dark-Primal Great Emperor’s second descent into the world. When the Yin Dao was obstructed and the Zhou virtue declined, the land-sea seethed and the hundred rivers surged; mountains roared and valleys howled, rain shrieked and wind wailed. He traversed the ages as dust in the historian’s records, then abandoned the pillar-scribe’s post to conceal his traces. Binding his robes, he departed the Wei Gate and crossed west through the Han Pass, riding a carriage drawn by a green ox in graceful turns, driving a white phoenix in carefree flight. Xu Jia held the reins as he followed the Transcendent Emperor in arrival; Yin Xi divined the winds and knew the Dao Lord must come. Though briefly parted, three thousand *jiazi* cycles had once made him a crimson youth; though reunited, eight hundred years of age now clung to the Yellow and the Old. Secretly he transmitted the wondrous formulas, silently he entrusted the subtle words, renewing the thousand-day covenant and reconvening the one-hour assembly.\n\nFor a moment he paid homage to the Primal Beginning, then ascended to the Heaven within Heaven. Forever he served his ancestral master, returning once more to the form beyond forms. He opened the Cold Numinous Elixir Palace, ascended the Jeweled Terrace of All Treasures, sat in the Purple-Gold Grove, and reposed upon the Azure-Jade Throne. The Transcendent Earl of Grand Clarity bore the star-embroidered brocade banner; the Transcendent Duke of Great Ultimate wielded the moon-bright spirit-summoning staff. All bowed their heads and prostrated, contemplating mind with mind.\n\nThereupon he summoned the Azure Lad of the Azure Emperor, transformed into a ram in the land of Shu, rode the purple clouds to the Purple Palace, and descended auspicious omens upon the royal chambers. The sound of his unceasing voice reached the newborn’s cry; in an instant, the infant’s wailing ceased. From the body of a crimson child he reverted to a white-haired elder. In a moment his stature exceeded ten feet; in an instant his face radiated fivefold light. Upon his head he wore a crown of the Seven Luminaries wrought in openwork; from his shoulders draped a nine-hued mantle of gossamer silk. His guards numbered beyond a hundred million; his transcendent retinue formed throngs. The assembled Perfected of the Ten Directions filled the vast expanse; the auspicious vapors of the Eight Extremities suffused the void. Fragrance wafted from the ninefold subtle flames; flowers drifted like six-pointed snow.\n\nAbout to depart Shu, he sought to transform the barbarian winds, journeying far to the Flowing Sands to reform the savage customs. In the lands of India and Kabul, he taught King Fan-tuo and King A-zhu, curbing their stubborn and perverse hearts, dispelling their intent to boil, burn, chisel, and pierce. When vast cauldrons seethed with bubbling water, he entered as though stepping into frozen springs; when pyres of piled wood blazed to the heavens, he sat as though enveloped in mist. Those who brandished white cudgels saw them as withered reeds; those who wielded red blades found them dull as lead. The armies of the Four Heavens advanced with thunderous clamor; the deities of ten thousand *li* shielded him, their power shifting mountains and rivers. The eighty kinds of Qiang and Rong submitted to pure transformation; the two thousand lands of fierce savagery forever abandoned their benighted ways.\n\nOnce customs were transformed and the Dao accomplished, he divided his body to become a buddha, aiding the Tathāgata’s thousand *kalpas* of merit; he descended in traces to become a master, relieving the king’s myriad affairs of state. As for the bronze armillary measuring the heavens and the jade calendar reckoning auspiciousness: when heaven’s seven, five, one, three, and nine cycles reached completion, and earth’s eight, six, two, four, and ten cycles attained fulfillment; when the disasters of the Nine Yangs were exhausted and the reckonings of the Hundred Sixes thoroughly probed—even in the eras of Fu Xi, Shen Nong, and the Yellow Emperor, none could escape these, nor could the courts of Gao Xin, Tang, and Yu avoid them.\n\nIn the first year of Guangming, the year *shangzhang* in the cycle, the month of the great clam, a great villain rose to fame in the imperial capital, and a chief brigand disturbed the kingdom’s course. Weapons entwined the nine wilds; all ministers counseled the emperor to inspect the provinces. Serpents arose in the land winds; the four peaks welcomed the imperial progress. The long whale gaped, its roar drinking the waters of Li and spouting those of Hao; the boar with tusks like swords charged the ranks of blades and awls. Before the gadflies could strike, they devoured the fat of our people; before the ants could be eradicated, they burrowed into the foundations of our towers. Dust shrouded the imperial canopy; bandits blocked the celestial thoroughfares.\n\nNine dragons drew the cloud chariot as the jade wheel turned west; ten thousand chariots circled the earth’s axis as the golden gates opened to the south. Crossing waters, the wave spirits bore the boat; ascending land, the earth deities escorted the imperial cortege. Within the Great Mystery City, a traveling palace manifested; beside the Brocade-Washing River, the main hall was temporarily established. Those bearing jade and silk numbered myriad states; those arrayed in ranks of mandarin ducks filled a thousand offices. The flocks of Goose Forest came to court; the Turtle Mountain loosed its moorings. The cities of Crane Marsh presented tribute; the elephant-drawn carriages of foreign kings arrived.\n\nAt the time when the Rong and Yi submitted in compliance, when the tracks of carts merged and the world was united—when the Miao people had not yet been pacified, requiring the aid of sagely counsel; when the Hu clan prolonged its punishment, relying on the strength of the imperial teacher—generals versed in the *Bear Stratagems* and *Leopard Stratagems* bowed to military merit; the Dragon-Horn and Ram-Horn mountains could trace their sacred omens. Twenty-eight transformations still rode the white deer to arrive; the hundred-six disasters must be met astride the azure steed to save.\n\nHe propped up the ancestral altars and aided the imperial descendants in secret. Crimson light blazed upon the palace halls, heralding the advent of Great Peace; purple vapors glowed upon the plum and bamboo, presaging supreme felicity. Examining these transformations, he illuminated their responses; tracing his numinous traces, he indeed obtained the solid rice. Above was an ancient seal-script inscription: *The Supreme Brings Peace, the Center Harmonizes Disasters.* Thereupon he verified the six characters, manifesting a hundred auspicious signs. Struck, it resounded like the cry of a phoenix; beheld, it resembled a vast jade disc. Through the ages of Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei, the jade script remained fresh; through the dynasties of Jin, Song, Liang, and Sui, the silver hooks showed no decay. Stored in layered caskets, sealed with utmost secrecy, it glorified the imperial enterprise and emblazoned the green histories.\n\nAs the years and generations stretched distant and the boundaries of fields shifted, the old site became overgrown with moss, the ancient altar lay in ruins. The immortal homeland and former abode now half belonged to common households; the remnants of the true realm’s winds lingered only in broken tiles and scattered rubble. Beneath the withered pines in the night moon, one might still hear the cries of dark cranes; amid the autumn grasses and evening mist, one could but listen to the echoes of thrushes in the sedge. The cloud caves of that time now sheltered foxes and hares; the mushroom fields of old had all grown millet and grain.",

A single strand of white hair could lift a ten-thousand-*jin* stone; a few feet of green bamboo could transform into a hundred-*zhang* dragon. Those who attained it saw their seven ancestors ascend; those who lost it remained deluded in their single lifetime. It lies only in steadfast cultivation and careful practice, forsaking bitterness and forgetting toil—thus one may refine the Two Modes and moisten the Nine Lands.",

      "translated_text": "Pursuing afar the numinous traces, their wondrous proofs stood manifest. The Emperor specially issued a luminous edict to construct a sacred palace, bestowing upon both inner and outer courts two million strings of cash from the treasury to summon artisans and hasten the work. Thereupon the wood spirits delivered timber, and a nine-tiered towering structure arose; the earth deities offered soil, and a hundred walls simultaneously took form. The water lords advanced springs to fashion pools, while the mountain spirits hastened stones to lay foundations. Lofty cloud-piercing pavilions seemed to have sprung forth by transformation; the soaring Jade Mist Hall appeared as though newly risen from the earth. Eaves spread like wings, and beams pressed down like molted rainbows; plastered walls gleamed frost-white, and cinnabar pillars blazed like fire. Windows captured inverted reflections, and doors opened onto endless skies. Newly sculpted images took shape, their forms just descended, their expressions on the verge of speech, as if expounding the texts of the Five Thousand Words; their demeanor poised to depart, transforming scholars of the ten directions. Golden censers exuded fragrance, and jeweled parasols revolved. At first glimpse of the lamb emerging from its pen, one might still doubt its kneeling to nurse; at the initial sight of the horse white as silk, one could yet fear its neighing to the wind.\n\nThe courtyard, cleared of brambles, sprouted jade-like grasses anew; the garden, purged of weeds, burst forth with blossoms of jasper. Hills and mounds rose steeply, and towers and terraces stood grand and open. The halls of Qi’s round marshes and Wei’s square pools vied in splendor; the palace of the Transformed Man of the Western Limits stood in rivalry. Drawing in the numinous might of the Sword Pass, all converged at the imperial seat; gathering the radiant essence of Mount Emei, half entered the capital city. Smoke withered upon the azure altars, and wind carried the clear chimes of stone. Thus the Five Elders descended, and the Four Perfected all arrived. With a stroke upon the earth, rivers and lakes took form; with a pinch of soil, mountains and peaks arose. Seated, they summoned wind and rain, capable of overturning the Luo and upending the Yellow River; standing, they raised clouds and mist, able to reverse day into night. Transforming grasses and trees into armies, altering men and horses into groves, such a host could not be vanquished in a hundred battles; such a campaign against rebels could not be matched even by seven captures.\n\nThus when celestial calamities spread, they adhered to the principles of waxing and waning; when the cycles of fate ebbed and flowed, they accorded with the proper measures of fortune and misfortune. Zuo Ci summoned divine soldiers to lash and scatter bandits; Xu Xun commanded mighty warriors to sever and purge raging demons. Therefore, the hidden order of humanity was woven by ten thousand sages. At the cinnabar waters of Jiao Man, repeated offerings of sincere prayers bore fruit; at the Kunyang plains of Mu Ye, successive presentations of captured foes brought victory. Armor and weapons gleamed across the eight rivers, and encampments blocked the four suburbs. Battle formations stretched like clouds, and the din of war resounded like thunder. Blood spattered the sky and fell in crimson showers; sand swelled across the fields and drifted like yellow clouds. Cornered beasts snapped their fangs, and long serpents feared their tails. The people of Zheng and Cao fled in disarray; the tents of Chu stood utterly empty. Virtue balanced, righteous warriors gave their lives; qi unyielding, the royal army never aged. Day after day, the clamor of gongs and drums never ceased, yet no weariness was declared; year after year, iron armor was never doffed, yet no hardship was spoken.\n\nThereafter, the Phoenix City was restored to light, and the Dragon’s virtue shone resplendent. Crooked arrows upon the bowstring—what need for their piercing the moon? Long poles in hand—what purpose in their striking the heavens? Thus the thread of succession was repaired, and the raging rhinoceros was caged; the way of the martial waned, and the traitor’s head was severed by a loyal heart. Lu Shan’s fate was exhausted, and his belly was split by a gray-headed servant. Moreover, the rebellious nest had violated the celestial order, its perverse qi soaring to the skies. For seven or eight years, the chirping crickets gathered; for tens of thousands, the howling wolves assembled. The nine lands were ravaged, and the two capitals were violated. Yet by delaying punishment to spread the net of Heaven’s blessing and extending benevolent winds to temper execution, five years of stolen life were reclaimed, and all evil was eradicated in a single stroke. The tomb of Chi You was completed, his iron forehead buried deep; the throat of the Long Di was severed, and the carved halberds were forever stilled.\n\nSuch divine achievements truly relied upon the power of the Dao. Our Supreme Emperor of the Golden Watchtower, the Mysterious Origin, Heavenly Sovereign, and Great Thearch—father and mother of Heaven and Earth, master and teacher of emperors and kings—has instructed the Three Sovereigns for eighteen thousand years, presiding over the four qi and harmonizing the five movements. Uniting with the positions of state, he eternally bestowed them upon his descendants. The sacred lineage, equal to the sun and moon, has continued the eighteen thousand years.\n\nOur High Ancestor, the Divine Yao Emperor, responded to Heaven’s mandate, bearing the mandate of fate within himself. Gazing upon the homeland, he departed not far from the immortal realm; embodying supreme virtue without claiming it, he augmented the imperial virtue to ever greater heights. Casting aside the nine vermilion tally tablets, he sealed mountains and stamped the seas; pursuing the eight transcendent chariots, he rolled through mists and wound through clouds. Bearing the banner of peace, he faced the sun and spread transformation.\n\nOur Emperor Taizong of Civil and Martial Virtue grasped Qian and unfolded Kun, cultivating culture and pacifying arms. Great ritual knew no bounds, yet in a hundred rites he exhausted their root and origin; great sound was without tone, yet in a single note he shook past and present. Heaven bestowed courage and wisdom, enabling him to bind tigers and leopards like bundled straw; divine aid strengthened the imperial might, allowing him to measure dragons and serpents like knotted worms. Returning to truth and reverting to simplicity, he wandered in art and abided in benevolence. Taking non-binding as binding, he bound the six heroes and five hegemons; taking non-vessels as vessels, he encompassed the four insults and the nine provinces. Thereafter, contending in non-contention, warfare forever ceased; desiring in non-desire, cravings forever vanished.\n\nMasters of the Dao gathered in throngs, and perfected lords arrived. The jujubes of An Qi took strange forms, as large as gourds; the cocoons of Yuan Ke assumed unusual shapes, piled like basins. Clad in robes for one hundred and fifty generations, he reigned for eighteen thousand years.\n\nWe now reverently consider Your Majesty, the Sagely, Divine, Wise, Benevolent, Enlightened, and Filial Emperor, who has inherited the great enterprise and unified this grand endeavor. Your heart hangs upon the Mirror of Longevity, and your body dwells in the Garden of Blessings. The imperial Dao revives at the center, and the roots of the state stand deep and firm. May you eternally safeguard the divine regalia and forever uphold the imperial order.\n\nThe Tiger’s Fang General commands eight thousand valiant warriors; the Dragon-Head Marshal leads a million crack troops, forever stabilizing the realm and forever pacifying the world. The giant turtle perished, its body blocking the seas; the long whale was slain, its warning fins piercing the heavens. Some were roasted, some burned, consuming the trees of a thousand mountains; some were boiled, some cooked, exhausting the springs of the five lakes. Purple flames reeked of blood and fat; green duckweed floated upon gore. Ominous suns fell, and comet stars plummeted; the azure canopy opened wide, and black qi vanished. The three heads of the great rebel were presented, and the nine ancestral temples of the imperial court were informed. Martial might shone through the ages, and a tower of skulls was erected upon the divine land.",

Such divine merit in securing the sacred lineage arose from the sagely might of the Most High—his governance was but to sit upright in serene dignity, facing south in reverent stillness.\n\nThe Military Commissioner of Jiannan Xichuan, Grand Commandant and concurrently Chancellor, Prince of Yingchuan, Chen Jingyi—when the summer sun hung high, it blazed with awe-inspiring radiance; the star of virtue gathered eternally, its auspicious brilliance clearly marked. From afar, he breached the Turtle City to welcome the Dragon Chariot, offering a jade ladle to pour the great transformation as if turning the azure heavens, and relocating Penglai to serve as a traveling palace as though parting the blue sea. Guo Qi’s fans stirred the ranks, Qian Neng’s scratching shook the mountains and forests, Han Xiusheng amassed mosquitoes into thunder, and Yang Shigu piled fireflies to rival the sun.\n\nThose captured were bound like rats; those executed were slaughtered like sheep. A hundred beasts danced before the court, worthy of inscription on jade tablets; the Five Ding labored beneath his banner, capable of shattering iron mountains. Even the talents of Wen Qiao and Zhuge Liang, the strategies of Xiao He and Wang Jun, could not compare. Once, Wei Gao had governed Chengdu for over twenty years, and Guo Ziyi had served as chief minister for two decades—yet when measuring their merits and benevolent governance, a single year’s surplus of nine harvests would not have been deemed excessive. Chen’s governance in Jiannan eclipsed Pei Du’s triumph in Huai’xi, all recorded in the annals to eternally illuminate his achievements.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Presence, Left Divine Strategy Army Commander-in-Chief, and Ten Armies’ Military Supervisor, Tian Lingzi—like a jade pillar of Kunlun, he alone propped up the heavens; like a golden lotus of Mount Taihua, he held the sun in his heart. Born to aid the sagely and serve the state, his talents surpassed thousands and tens of thousands, his wisdom grasped ten from one. Warm and harmonious, he assisted the Blue Emperor in fostering life; lofty in spirit, he revered the teachings of the White King. Gazing upon the imperial tally, the Five Thieves all appeared; wielding the mirror of men, myriad phenomena could not escape. His hearing discerned the unspoken; his vision perceived the unformed. Assisting the times and establishing virtue, he founded a state and secured a household, dispensing rewards and punishments without bias. The feudal lords of the Nine Kingdoms cherished his grace; the generals and marshals of the Ten Armies pledged their loyalty. In self-restraint and sincerity, he devoted his heart to the Dao, so that ancient layered structures, when respected, differed not from cinnabar terraces; old rules and standards, when upheld, ascended like the white sun. He honored the supreme lord of rites and served the ceremonial Dharma King. Eight thousand divine beasts surged forth, while rhinoceroses and elephants seemed as ants; three hundred million heavenly soldiers turned seas and mountains like duckweed.\n\nHis achievements surpassed those of the Duke of Zhou, placing him first among men; his merits outshone those of the Marquis of Zheng, leaving none to rival him. Engraved upon tripods and bells, his virtues were extolled and his deeds recorded.\n\nThe Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs and concurrently Chancellor, Xiao Gou—his talents and learning were unparalleled, his spirit and brilliance spanned the ages. His literary sea subdued the waves of the Huai and lakes; his mountain of learning towered above the peaks of Heng and Huo. Heaven-endowed as the nation’s blessing, his literary grace nurtured his ministerial legacy. He rectified the imperial transformation with a single stroke and upheld the great balance with eightfold integrity. Within the bounds of his teaching, he deployed countless strategic marvels; within the steps of his jade tablet, he secured the multitudes of the realm. The yellow crane cried frequently, yet even the Duke of Shao could not restrain it; the blue ox never panted, its endurance as inscrutable as good fortune.\n\nThe Minister of Personnel and concurrently Chancellor, Wei Zhaodu—a vessel of the ancestral temple, a worthy minister of the altars of soil and grain. At his post, he shone like a star; at the court, he stood firm as a mountain. His virtue, like jade tablets, was uniquely eminent; his heart, like pine and bamboo, was steadfast and true. He grounded himself in the Six Classics, rectifying customs with elegance; he harmonized the flavors of salt and plum to enrich the Dao, strengthening state and household. Though he occupied the position of the Three Excellencies, he remained empty as the ninth rank; though he bore the name of the Eight Elders, he left it unclaimed.\n\nThe Minister of War and concurrently Chancellor, Pei Jie—a steed of blessing, a heavenly colt displaying its talents. His heroic integrity spanned the age; his pure wind cleansed the world. The Silver River spanned the sky in lofty clarity; the Jade Cord hung with celestial brilliance. His learning flowed like fourfold waves; his calligraphy resembled five pines in misty rain. His upright qi chilled the court and the wilds; his straight path threaded the sheep’s gut trail. Since assuming office in the imperial domain and rising in this illustrious age, he had twice grasped the oar of Fu Yue and twice wielded the scales of Gao Yao. All honed their wisdom’s blade to sever the waist of chaos, tempered their literary spear to pierce the belly of obstinacy.\n\nThe Inner Flying Dragon Commissioner, Yang Fugong—born of an armored lineage and a distinguished clan, his fame resounded through three teachings and his clarity flowed through the nine streams. In embodying things, he stood with Zhang and Que; in pure sentiment, he surpassed Bao and Xie. Among brothers, he was one of eight dragons stirring the clouds; in discourse on classics and history, he humbled the five deer. Holding the pivot of governance through successive generations, his illustrious name spanned a hundred schools. Endowed with the immortal bearing of Wu Jizha and the quick wisdom of Kong Wenzi, his green mountains cradled jade, radiating light from every peak; his green waters held pearls, casting crystalline brilliance across the river.\n\nThe Inner Privy Councilor and Grand Chancellor with Equal Rank to the Three Dukes, Tian Yunli—his four virtues matched his position; the five stars blazed with his spirit. His purity surpassed the jade pot; his righteousness outweighed golden promises. His wisdom, round as the moon, ever lent its light to the sun; his eloquence, flowing as a river, ever replenished the king’s sea. Upright in qi and steadfast in heart, warm and reverent, he possessed the grand talents of a king’s aide and the weighty vessel of an emperor’s minister. At the axis, his body aligned with the earth’s foundations; at the pivot, his hand corrected the heavens’ patterns. A longtime observer of the Daoist gate, he revered the true teachings with white silk and plain speech. Though his words were not embellished, he always spoke with forthright sincerity; though his Dharma language was venerable, it ever accorded with the principles of peace.",

      "translated_text": "The Internal Privy Councilor and Cavalry General-in-Chief Li Shunrong emerged as one of the three prodigies, his brilliance outshining a thousand mountains; his nobility rivaled the loftiness of Yuan Li’s Dragon Gate, and his blessings extended to his worthy descendants. In youth, his stature equaled the crane-borne carriage of Shao Jun, his fortune nurturing the sacred lineage. Entrusted with the secrets of ten thousand affairs, he succored the people of an entire realm. His clarity was such that the water-mirror held emptiness; his uprightness so pure that the crimson plumb-line yielded its beauty. His erudition rivaled the achievements of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors, while his integrity in adversity wove brocade into literary splendor. With a full belly, he guarded solemnity, casting a hundred cares from his breast; with an empty heart, he received all things, embracing the distant and wild within his square-inch mind.\n\nThe Military Inspector and General of the Biaoqi Division, concurrently Commissioner of the Three Rivers, Liu Jingxuan, bore auspicious signs from past lives, his clouds of fortune unfolding in radiant hues. His bearing was peerlessly noble, his talent and capacity vast and profound. Like the jade branch of the King of Southern Yue, his phoenix soared near; like the orchid companion of the Old Man of the River, his crane’s flight was not far. His diligence in aiding and protecting was unceasing, his meritorious deeds forever inscribed.\n\nThe Right Street Majestic Daoist Master Yin Siguan, a divine immortal of towering lineage, descended from flourishing branches. He was the true heir of the Supreme Lord of Mysterious Origin and the wise descendant of the Perfected Lord of Wen Shi. At seven, he awakened to the Dao; at thirteen, he met his master. His bones, near-perfected as purple jade, would one day wander the Boarded Garden; his mastery of the Yellow Writ complete, he ascended to the Vermilion Mound. The Daoist Li Wuwei, of national origin and celestial lineage, dwelt in the fragrant shade of heaven. He delved into a thousand layers of true secrets, mastering all; he perused ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, leaving none unread. Together in their master’s gate, they forged bonds as Daoist companions. In the second heaven’s phoenix cocoon, they refined spiritual qi into script; with dragon pellets of grain, they preserved youthful countenances to transcend kalpas. Adorned in starry crowns and moonlit robes, they paid homage to the Primal Emperor; mounted on rainbow reins and cloud chariots, they faced the Great Emperor. Five *hu* of golden silkworms secretly spun immortal threads; a pair of jade tablets distantly welcomed true hymns.\n\nSince ancient times, loyal ministers and enlightened sovereigns have governed the realm to ascend to heaven, responding to the rhythms of destiny to save their age, reviving the living and completing their works. Shao Hao and Zhuanxu both ascended to the Purple Tenuity Palace; Jun Shi and the Grand Duke together rode the azure mists. Their palaces and chambers, terraces and ponds, seemed formed from clouds and mist, as if painted in cinnabar and blue. The seventy-two blessed lands and thirty-six grotto-heavens, the interconnected abodes of immortals—with Mount Qingcheng as their doors and windows, the winds and mists of true scenes untainted—with Mount Pan as their altars, could ferry the four deluded and propagate the seven divisions. Immortal robes, though unstitched, were naturally complete, needing no needle and thread; immortal carriages, though unharnessed, moved of themselves, leaving no wheel tracks. In the ninefold heavens, white jade formed the capital; within the thousand-*zhi* walls, yellow gold built the halls. Clad in a single garment, they hung the sun and moon upon their bodies; crowned with ceremonial tassels, they sat amidst heaven and earth. The celestial net was rectified, the four qi harmonized; the nation’s steps were secure, the three primals ordered. In hand, they held the handle of longevity, shaping the white colt; in heart, they concealed the root of the essential Dao, riding the red carp.\n\nMoreover, as eras shifted and times changed across three thousand years, as states were founded and nations established for over forty thousand years, new gates and lanes arose, and the thriving populace flourished. Though the gates of that time were closed, the hairpins and topknots remained as if present; though the palace courts of today were newly built, their splendor surpassed the old. Flocks of seven-colored phoenixes frequently arrived in their carriages; nine-spotted dragon chariots reverently made their rounds. The Celestial Mansion of the Great Void kept its ever-open, sleepless gates; the Infinite Blessing Hall forever faced the scene of eternal spring. Their qi connected with the azure vault; their light outshone the Red City.\n\nThis minister, unworthy though he is of the imperial forest, has presumptuously enjoyed the role of a literary retainer. He has waded the Confucian sea but found his learning shallow; crossed the river of letters but found his depth lacking. The five-colored gnats of Dong Zhongshu rarely alight upon his brush; the threefold purity of Yang Xiong seldom graces his brush-tip. Ashamed of his lack of Huang Xiang’s talent, he struggles to record the purple mists of auspicious omens.\n\nAn ode says:",

Purple qi swirled and billowed; crimson light blazed and glowed. Numinous meals and jade talismans eternally marked the Middle Revival. Ninety thousand immortals all stood under his command; three hundred million warriors all dwelt within his service. Thus he could move heaven and earth, shift seas and mountains, transform fish and turtles into soldiers, slay the bronze-headed foe, change armies into groves, bury iron cavalry. Supporting the sacred destiny, aiding the royal armies in secret, he annihilated the ringleaders, swept clean the cosmos, hung the heads of the Three Villains, offered the might of the Nine Temples, perfected the imperial enterprise, and eternally pacified the nation’s course.\n\nYour minister, kneeling to receive the sagacious decree and reverently obeying the imperial benevolence, though his learning is shallow and his knowledge scant, has composed these crude words.

The jade altar conceals wondrous signs; crimson light surges forth from the earth’s script. Of old, a mysterious talisman remained in ancient seal-script.
