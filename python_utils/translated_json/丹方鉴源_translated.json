  "full_translation": "**Mirror of Alchemical Recipes**\n*Title:* *Mirror of Alchemical Recipes* (*Danfang Jianyuan*)\n*Author:* Du Gu Tao of the Tang Dynasty\n*Volume:* Three\n*Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Metaphysics*, *Category of Miscellaneous Arts*\n\n---\n\n### *Mirror of Alchemical Recipes, Volume I*\n\n#### **Chapter One: Gold and Silver**\n\n**Wheat-Bran Gold** – Found in the Han River, Jiang River, and Five Streams, sometimes shaped like scattered grains. Silla gold has a bluish hue and is brittle; counterfeits are often made by coating silver with a white layer resembling *shu* stone. When burned, it blackens, revealing its natural \"tooth\" (a crystalline structure), also called *huangya* (\"yellow sprout\").\n\n**Raw Silver** – Mined in Luoping, Lanlu, and Lushi County, with a halo-like sheen. When broken, its interior is white. It forms within lead veins, sometimes resembling *xiaozi* (a type of seed). This silver possesses transformative properties and is also called *ziran ya* (\"natural sprout\"), *shengqian* (\"raw lead\"), or *ziran qian* (\"natural lead\").\n\n**Mountain-Refined Gold** – Large and suitable for crafting vessels. This is a \"dead\" substance, its nature already hardened and unyielding.\n\n**Cinnabar-Refined Mercury** – If used for vessels, it may serve as a protective talisman but is unfit for consumption, as it absorbs the toxic *qi* of gold.\n\n**White Silver** – Can be fashioned into vessels, like the above. It is also used to coagulate *sha zi* (mercury sulfide) for practical applications.\n\n**Mercury Silver** – Can be used to gild gold and to seal the lids of *yongquan* (mercury distillation) vessels, relying on its \"dead\" (stabilized) mercury.\n\n**Cinnabar Silver** – If refined with its \"mother\" (base metal), it is unusable. When properly mothered, it can gild yellow gold.\n\n**Lead Silver** – Extracted from lead ores. When smelted, it appears slightly refined and can be made into vessels or used to nurture cinnabar.\n\n**Tin Silver and Iron Silver** – Lack transformative *qi*.\n\n**Red Silver** – Can gild gold and be transmuted into *du ti dan yang* (a pure, cinnabar-like elixir).\n\n**Mother-Child Silver** – Silver coagulated with mercury, which does not evaporate when heated with a torch. It can be divided and nurtured endlessly.\n\n**Wuchang Copper** – Mined in Ezhou, soft and white. It can be transmuted into *dan yang* silver and used to forge *shu* stone, *fan zhe* copper, and *shu chuan chi zha* copper into *dan yang*. When heated and hammered, it does not crack.\n\n**Natural Copper** – Can be ingested as a medicinal substance.\n\n**Copper Powder** – Refined copper powder aids in healing fractures and can be subdued alongside *zhou sha* (cinnabar).\n\n**Iron Magnetite** – The essence of iron, usable in alchemy.\n\n**Lead Silver** – Lead that does not yield silver; this is its true form.\n\n**Jiazhou Longtuo Lead** – Mined in Jiazhou, it is the purest essence of lead, possessing transformative properties.\n\n**White Lead** – Also called *zi zhen qian* (\"purple true lead\").\n\n**Hook-Foot Lead** – Found in various counties of Yazhou, resembling *zaozi* (jujube pits) or *kedouzi* (tadpoles), black in color. It emerges from mountain streams and sandy gullies, used to dry mercury silver. Also called *yu qian* (\"fish lead\").\n\n**Grass-Knot Lead** – Unrefined raw lead from Jiazhou. When broken, it is brittle and burns like sulfur.\n\n**Xinzhou Lead** – Completely unusable, as it is tainted with copper *qi*. Particularly unsuitable for crafting jade-like substances.\n\n**Lushi Lead** – Inferior to Jiazhou lead; it must be mixed with *pi ying sha* (a type of cinnabar) to be of use.\n\n**Yinping Lead** – Mined in the sword-producing regions, it is the precursor of hard iron and cannot be used in alchemy.\n\n**Lead Su** – When mercury is added and steamed with vinegar vapor, it forms a white frost resembling sulfur.\n\n**Lead Yellow Blossom** – When mercury is added and nurtured, it floats to the surface. This can be collected and roasted into *huang dan* (yellow elixir), which is also usable.\n\n**Tin That Can Become Silver** – When *que sha* (realgar) is added, it hardens; when lead is added, it silences sound.\n\n**Mercury** – Best extracted from cinnabar. When moved on silk, it leaves a \"rat-tail\" trail, indicating its affinity for lead. In large quantities, it fears acidic and astringent stones.\n*Secret Formula:* To \"kill\" mercury, nothing surpasses \"dead\" mercury.\n*The Scripture* states:\n*\"The fox and hare do not nurse the horse; the cuckoo does not hatch the phoenix.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"To grow millet, use millet seeds; to hatch a chick, use an egg.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Different kinds do not share the same lineage; how can they dwell as one body?\"*\n*Yuanyang* says: *\"Gold transforms into gold, silver into silver.\"*\nGold from the Jinxia Gorge and silver from the \"silver silkworm\" are both essential in the Great Refinement and the arts of *huang bai* (transmutation).\n\n---\n\n#### **Chapter Two: Various Yellow Substances**\n\n**Realgar** – *Secret Formula:* After a thousand years, realgar transforms into gold.\n*The Yellow Emperor* says: Realgar can transmute copper. The finest comes from Wudu, with Xifan (Tibetan) realgar being secondary. The iron-colored variety is superior, followed by the rooster-comb type. When placed in mercury, its base should be wiped with iron filings; if a yellow film forms immediately, it is of the highest grade.\n\n**Orpiment** – When mined in Zicheng, it is black; when dried, it becomes light like scorched tin. If it emits a foul odor, it is hard and lacks a film. The testing method: grind it on a fingernail; if it adheres, it is good. Alternatively, heat an iron and press orpiment against its base; if a red-yellow line appears, it is of quality. Without orpiment, transmuting gold is impossible.\n\n**Orpiment (Yin Side)** – The yin-side variety is true orpiment. It can soften the five metals and dry mercury. The best resembles congealed blood from foreign ships, with Xiangnan orpiment being secondary. The greenish type is especially fine. It can be used to convert sulfur and subdue *fen shuang* (arsenic frost).\n\n**Pi Yellow** – Mined in Xinzhou, it can be sublimated into white frost, transmute copper, be ingested, dry mercury, and serve as a vessel for cinnabar.\n\n**Snake Yellow** – Can be used as a vessel for cinnabar; when subdued by fire, it becomes a vessel for elixirs.\n\n**Stone Yellow** – Can dry mercury and yield a golden hue.\n\n**Sulfur** – Can restrain mercury.\n*Secret Formula:* Sulfur blackens the five metals but reddens when combined with mercury.\nAlso called *huang nan* (\"yellow male\") or *huang ya* (\"yellow sprout\"), it is the root of *chou huang* (stinking yellow), which can transmute copper.\n\n---\n\n#### **Chapter Three: Various Cinnabars**\n\n**Cinnabar** – *Record* states: *\"Cinnabar is the water essence; only when united with gold does it become whole.\"*\nFound in Chenxi and the Five Streams, varieties such as *furong* (lotus), *jianzu* (arrowhead), *jingmian* (mirror-surface), and *tiese guangming* (iron-colored and luminous) cinnabar are all suitable for ingestion and the transmutation of *huang bai* (gold and silver).\n\n**Shangzhou Cinnabar** – Unusable.\n\n**Qianzhong Cinnabar** – Also unusable. It contains the *qi* of great yin and mercury, aligning with the *qi* of gold, silver, copper, and lead. Through fire, it can be transformed into other substances.\n\n**Roasted Cinnabar** – [...]\n\nFrom Beiting, there is a yellow variety.\n*Formula* states: *\"It is called the 'gold-thief,' capable of regulating and harmonizing within the midst of various medicinal ingredients. It also possesses the power to restrain both yang and yin.\"*\n\n**Great Peng Cinnabar** – Can restrain mercury and mute the sound of copper.\n\n**Great Peng Cinnabar from Guozhou** – Can coagulate into cinnabar grains.\n\n**Needle Cinnabar** – Can restrain sulfur to form purple powder; can be used as iron mud for sealing.\n\n**Hu-Nü Cinnabar** – Also called \"silver-yellow,\" found in silver smelters. It can soften iron and subdue cinnabar.\n\n**Luan Cinnabar** – Found in Lantian, the size of a soybean, black in color; can be used to make alchemical vessels.\n\n**Sea White Cinnabar** – Can be used for outer vessels and facilitates the flow of fire *qi*.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter Four: Various Alums**\n\n**Yellow Alum** – That from overseas ships is best; from Guazhou, superior; from Wenhui, secondary. In Xichuan, yellow alum is selected from black alum—when it is about to emerge but has not yet fully formed, that which can draw forth golden threads is of the highest grade. It can transmute mercury into gold and also transform iron.\n\n**Purple Alum** – The Persian variety resembles purple stone; it can transmute silver into gold and desiccate mercury. That from Wenzhou resembles black tin lumps.\n\n**White Alum** – Used to desiccate mercury; can temper tin and restrain various yellow substances.\n\n**Persian White Alum** – Shaped like thorns; can desiccate mercury.\n\n**Green Alum** – Can nurture cinnabar and boil copper.\n\n**Verdigris Alum** – Can restrain mercury and produce a golden hue.\n\n**Black Alum** – Can restrain mercury and form frost powder.\n\n**Chicken-Dropping Alum** – Restrains mercury and yields a golden hue.\n\n**Kunlun Alum** – Restrains mercury and nurtures cinnabar.\n\n**Iron Alum** – Found in Wenshui County, Taiyuan; resembles red halloysite with golden stars—this is the genuine variety.

Some falsely claim its blackness can be consumed for longevity. If used as medicine, excessive intake will surely cause great harm.\n**Pao Sha** – This substance is highly toxic. Those with *Shen Ling* disease may consume it, but it harms the efficacy of other medicines; cease use immediately. Overconsumption leads to accumulation and severe blockages.\n**Dragon-Tiger Head** – When mercury encounters sulfur, it turns red. If it reddens within days of burning, it is deemed a fine medicine. Yet they fail to recognize that sulfur’s toxicity lingers on mercury. Though it may appear black and red, it remains unfit for consumption.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Refining the Five Yellows Pill**\n\nTake one *liang* each of realgar, orpiment, *pi* yellow, sulfur, and yellow alum. Melt them together and grind with rice vinegar until moist. Then heat to extract, and use the resulting dark residue.\n\nFirst, prepare one *jin* of refined salt into salt flowers. Place them in a *Yao Tai*, lining the bottom. Use a new small clay pot that fits snugly. Place the medicine on the salt, then cover with the pot, sealing the edges with salt clay. Heat from below to sublimate the medicine onto the pot’s bottom. Once fully sublimated, scrape it off. Grind again with rice vinegar, repeat the process until all medicine is sublimated. Then grind it separately, mix with *kui wei* as a base, and place the medicine on top. Burn one *jin* of fire. After grinding, form into pills the size of white beans. One pill refines one *liang* of mercury.\n\nUse a new crucible. First, create a pit with yellow earth and place one *liang* of mercury inside. Warm it, add one pill, and wait for the sizzling to cease—it will turn black. Do not repeat this process in mountain marshes; employ a separate crucible method.\n\n*End of Dan Fang Jian Yuan, Volume Three*",

      "translated_text": "**Mirror of Alchemical Recipes**\n*Title:* *Mirror of Alchemical Recipes* (*Danfang Jianyuan*)\n*Author:* Du Gu Tao of the Tang Dynasty\n*Volume:* Three\n*Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Metaphysics*, *Category of Miscellaneous Arts*\n\n---\n\n### *Mirror of Alchemical Recipes, Volume I*\n\n#### **Chapter One: Gold and Silver**\n\n**Wheat-Bran Gold** – Found in the Han River, Jiang River, and Five Streams, sometimes shaped like scattered grains. Silla gold has a bluish hue and is brittle; counterfeits are often made by coating silver with a white layer resembling *shu* stone. When burned, it blackens, revealing its natural \"tooth\" (a crystalline structure), also called *huangya* (\"yellow sprout\").\n\n**Raw Silver** – Mined in Luoping, Lanlu, and Lushi County, with a halo-like sheen. When broken, its interior is white. It forms within lead veins, sometimes resembling *xiaozi* (a type of seed). This silver possesses transformative properties and is also called *ziran ya* (\"natural sprout\"), *shengqian* (\"raw lead\"), or *ziran qian* (\"natural lead\").\n\n**Mountain-Refined Gold** – Large and suitable for crafting vessels. This is a \"dead\" substance, its nature already hardened and unyielding.\n\n**Cinnabar-Refined Mercury** – If used for vessels, it may serve as a protective talisman but is unfit for consumption, as it absorbs the toxic *qi* of gold.\n\n**White Silver** – Can be fashioned into vessels, like the above. It is also used to coagulate *sha zi* (mercury sulfide) for practical applications.\n\n**Mercury Silver** – Can be used to gild gold and to seal the lids of *yongquan* (mercury distillation) vessels, relying on its \"dead\" (stabilized) mercury.\n\n**Cinnabar Silver** – If refined with its \"mother\" (base metal), it is unusable. When properly mothered, it can gild yellow gold.\n\n**Lead Silver** – Extracted from lead ores. When smelted, it appears slightly refined and can be made into vessels or used to nurture cinnabar.\n\n**Tin Silver and Iron Silver** – Lack transformative *qi*.\n\n**Red Silver** – Can gild gold and be transmuted into *du ti dan yang* (a pure, cinnabar-like elixir).\n\n**Mother-Child Silver** – Silver coagulated with mercury, which does not evaporate when heated with a torch. It can be divided and nurtured endlessly.\n\n**Wuchang Copper** – Mined in Ezhou, soft and white. It can be transmuted into *dan yang* silver and used to forge *shu* stone, *fan zhe* copper, and *shu chuan chi zha* copper into *dan yang*. When heated and hammered, it does not crack.\n\n**Natural Copper** – Can be ingested as a medicinal substance.\n\n**Copper Powder** – Refined copper powder aids in healing fractures and can be subdued alongside *zhou sha* (cinnabar).\n\n**Iron Magnetite** – The essence of iron, usable in alchemy.\n\n**Lead Silver** – Lead that does not yield silver; this is its true form.\n\n**Jiazhou Longtuo Lead** – Mined in Jiazhou, it is the purest essence of lead, possessing transformative properties.\n\n**White Lead** – Also called *zi zhen qian* (\"purple true lead\").\n\n**Hook-Foot Lead** – Found in various counties of Yazhou, resembling *zaozi* (jujube pits) or *kedouzi* (tadpoles), black in color. It emerges from mountain streams and sandy gullies, used to dry mercury silver. Also called *yu qian* (\"fish lead\").\n\n**Grass-Knot Lead** – Unrefined raw lead from Jiazhou. When broken, it is brittle and burns like sulfur.\n\n**Xinzhou Lead** – Completely unusable, as it is tainted with copper *qi*. Particularly unsuitable for crafting jade-like substances.\n\n**Lushi Lead** – Inferior to Jiazhou lead; it must be mixed with *pi ying sha* (a type of cinnabar) to be of use.\n\n**Yinping Lead** – Mined in the sword-producing regions, it is the precursor of hard iron and cannot be used in alchemy.\n\n**Lead Su** – When mercury is added and steamed with vinegar vapor, it forms a white frost resembling sulfur.\n\n**Lead Yellow Blossom** – When mercury is added and nurtured, it floats to the surface. This can be collected and roasted into *huang dan* (yellow elixir), which is also usable.\n\n**Tin That Can Become Silver** – When *que sha* (realgar) is added, it hardens; when lead is added, it silences sound.\n\n**Mercury** – Best extracted from cinnabar. When moved on silk, it leaves a \"rat-tail\" trail, indicating its affinity for lead. In large quantities, it fears acidic and astringent stones.\n*Secret Formula:* To \"kill\" mercury, nothing surpasses \"dead\" mercury.\n*The Scripture* states:\n*\"The fox and hare do not nurse the horse; the cuckoo does not hatch the phoenix.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"To grow millet, use millet seeds; to hatch a chick, use an egg.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Different kinds do not share the same lineage; how can they dwell as one body?\"*\n*Yuanyang* says: *\"Gold transforms into gold, silver into silver.\"*\nGold from the Jinxia Gorge and silver from the \"silver silkworm\" are both essential in the Great Refinement and the arts of *huang bai* (transmutation).\n\n---\n\n#### **Chapter Two: Various Yellow Substances**\n\n**Realgar** – *Secret Formula:* After a thousand years, realgar transforms into gold.\n*The Yellow Emperor* says: Realgar can transmute copper. The finest comes from Wudu, with Xifan (Tibetan) realgar being secondary. The iron-colored variety is superior, followed by the rooster-comb type. When placed in mercury, its base should be wiped with iron filings; if a yellow film forms immediately, it is of the highest grade.\n\n**Orpiment** – When mined in Zicheng, it is black; when dried, it becomes light like scorched tin. If it emits a foul odor, it is hard and lacks a film. The testing method: grind it on a fingernail; if it adheres, it is good. Alternatively, heat an iron and press orpiment against its base; if a red-yellow line appears, it is of quality. Without orpiment, transmuting gold is impossible.\n\n**Orpiment (Yin Side)** – The yin-side variety is true orpiment. It can soften the five metals and dry mercury. The best resembles congealed blood from foreign ships, with Xiangnan orpiment being secondary. The greenish type is especially fine. It can be used to convert sulfur and subdue *fen shuang* (arsenic frost).\n\n**Pi Yellow** – Mined in Xinzhou, it can be sublimated into white frost, transmute copper, be ingested, dry mercury, and serve as a vessel for cinnabar.\n\n**Snake Yellow** – Can be used as a vessel for cinnabar; when subdued by fire, it becomes a vessel for elixirs.\n\n**Stone Yellow** – Can dry mercury and yield a golden hue.\n\n**Sulfur** – Can restrain mercury.\n*Secret Formula:* Sulfur blackens the five metals but reddens when combined with mercury.\nAlso called *huang nan* (\"yellow male\") or *huang ya* (\"yellow sprout\"), it is the root of *chou huang* (stinking yellow), which can transmute copper.\n\n---\n\n#### **Chapter Three: Various Cinnabars**\n\n**Cinnabar** – *Record* states: *\"Cinnabar is the water essence; only when united with gold does it become whole.\"*\nFound in Chenxi and the Five Streams, varieties such as *furong* (lotus), *jianzu* (arrowhead), *jingmian* (mirror-surface), and *tiese guangming* (iron-colored and luminous) cinnabar are all suitable for ingestion and the transmutation of *huang bai* (gold and silver).\n\n**Shangzhou Cinnabar** – Unusable.\n\n**Qianzhong Cinnabar** – Also unusable. It contains the *qi* of great yin and mercury, aligning with the *qi* of gold, silver, copper, and lead. Through fire, it can be transformed into other substances.\n\n**Roasted Cinnabar** – [...]",

Then grind it separately, mix with *kui wei* as a base, and place the medicine on top. Burn one *jin* of fire. After grinding, form into pills the size of white beans. One pill refines one *liang* of mercury.\n\nUse a new crucible. First, create a pit with yellow earth and place one *liang* of mercury inside.
