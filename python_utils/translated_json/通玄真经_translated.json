  "full_translation": "**The Comprehensive Classic of the Perfection of the Dao, *Wenzi* – Scroll One: The Origin of the Dao**\n\nLaozi said: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. It is formless yet possesses image, profound and obscure, silent and desolate, faint and indistinct. I cannot hear its sound, so I force a name upon it and call it the *Dao*.”\n\nNow, the *Dao* is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. It embraces Heaven and Earth, bestowing without form. Its source and flow surge ceaselessly, empty yet never full. When turbid, it slowly clarifies through stillness; its bounty is inexhaustible, unbound by time. Though it cannot be held in a single grasp, it contracts yet expands, conceals yet illuminates, softens yet hardens. It contains *yin* and exhales *yang*, revealing the three luminaries. Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it; beasts run by it, birds fly by it; the *lin* swims by it, the *feng* soars by it; the stars and constellations move by it. By loss it gains existence, by humility it attains honor, by retreat it takes the lead.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the *Dao* and stood at the center. Their spirits roamed with transformation, pacifying the four directions. Thus they could set Heaven in motion and Earth in stillness, turning the wheel without cease, flowing like water without end, beginning and ending with all things. Wind rises and clouds gather, thunder roars and rain falls—all respond without limit. Carved and polished, they return to simplicity.\n\nActing without action, they harmonized life and death; speaking without words, they penetrated virtue. Serene and unassuming, they attained harmony. Though myriad things differ, they all thrive by it. It harmonizes *yin* and *yang*, regulates the four seasons, balances the five phases, moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone. Beasts grow large, fur and feathers glisten; bird eggs do not spoil, animal fetuses do not miscarry. Fathers know no sorrow for lost sons, elder brothers no grief for dead younger brothers. Children are not orphaned, women are not widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not arise—all is the result of embodying virtue.\n\nThe great constant *Dao* gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. All things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it to die, yet none can resent it. It stores and accumulates without growing richer, distributes and bestows without becoming poorer. Vague and indistinct, it cannot be depicted. Elusive yet ever-present, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds and transforms without form. Flowing and penetrating, it moves not in vain. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, bows and rises with *yin* and *yang*.\n\nLaozi said: “The great man is tranquil and thoughtless, serene and carefree. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and *yin* and *yang* as his drivers. He travels where there are no roads, roams without weariness, departs through no gate. Taking Heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered; taking Earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. Taking the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded; taking *yin* and *yang* as his drivers, nothing is left unprepared. Thus he moves swiftly without swaying, travels far without fatigue. His four limbs do not stir, his hearing and vision do not diminish, yet he illuminates all under Heaven—grasping the essence of the *Dao*, he observes the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and guide them. The changes of the myriad things cannot be controlled; one must hold to their essence and return them to it. Thus the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. He sharpens his spirit and stills his knowledge and perceptions, so that in seeming inaction, nothing is left undone; in seeming non-governance, nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nWhat is called *non-action* is not acting before things do; *non-governance* is not altering the natural. *Nothing left ungoverned* means following the mutual arising of things.”\n\nLaozi said: “He who grasps the *Dao* to govern the people responds to events as they come and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their answer; the changes of a hundred affairs all find their match. Thus the *Dao* is emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these five are the forms and images of the *Dao*.\n\nEmptiness is the dwelling of the *Dao*; levelness is its essence; clarity and stillness are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function. Reversion is the constant of the *Dao*; softness is its hardness; weakness is its strength. Purity and simplicity are its trunk.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. When desires and cravings do not burden, emptiness reaches its utmost. When likes and dislikes are absent, levelness reaches its utmost. When unified and unchanging, stillness reaches its utmost. When unmingled with things, purity reaches its utmost. When neither sorrowful nor joyful, virtue reaches its utmost.\n\nThe governance of the perfected man discards cleverness and erases ornamentation. He relies on the *Dao* and abandons wisdom, emerging with the people from the public realm. He restricts what he holds, reduces what he seeks, removes enticements and longings, eliminates pride and desire, and casts aside thoughts and worries. Restricting what he holds brings clarity; reducing what he seeks brings attainment. Thus, by mastering the inner, he governs the outer, and nothing is left undone. Mastery of the inner allows him to shepherd the outer. When the inner is mastered, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are balanced, sinews and bones are strong, hearing and vision are keen.\n\nThe great *Dao* is smooth and broad, not far from the self. Those who seek it afar go forth only to return.”\n\nLaozi said: “The sage forgets about governing others and attends to self-cultivation. He values not power and position but self-attainment; when he attains the self, the world attains him. He delights not in wealth and honor but in harmony. Knowing the greatness of the self and the smallness of the world, he nears the *Dao*.\n\nThus it is said: ‘Utmost emptiness, steadfast stillness—while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.’ The *Dao* shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form. Silent and unmoving, it is vast and profoundly obscure, so broad and great that nothing lies beyond it, so minute that it cannot be divided within. Without walls or enclosure, it gives birth between being and non-being.”\n\nThe true person embodies emptiness and non-being, simplicity and ease, purity and stillness, softness and weakness, unadulterated plainness—unmixed with external things. Such is the virtue of Heaven and Earth’s *Dao*, and thus they are called true persons. The true person holds the self great and the world small, values the cultivation of the body and disdains the governance of others. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to disorder their emotions. They conceal their name and identity: when the *Dao* prevails, they remain hidden; when it does not, they appear. They practice non-doing, engage in non-affairs, know non-knowing. They embrace the Heavenly *Dao*, encompass the heart of Heaven, inhale and exhale yin and yang, exhale the old and inhale the new. With yin they close, with yang they open; with hardness and softness they coil and stretch; with yin and yang they bow and rise. Their heart aligns with Heaven, their body unites with the *Dao*. They feel no joy, no suffering, no delight, no anger. The myriad things are mystically one, without right or wrong.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, or dampness, the form decays and the spirit is cut off. When the spirit is injured by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, or worry, the spirit is exhausted while the form remains. Thus, the true person employs the heart, leans on nature, and relies on the spirit, supporting one another to attain completion. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.\n\nConfucius asked about the *Dao*. Laozi said: “Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your countenance, and the *Dao* will be your abode. Your pupils will be like a newborn calf, seeking nothing of the past. Your form will be like withered wood, your heart like dead ashes. Truly, you will know the real without clinging to partial reasons. Vast and unbounded, without a heart to scheme—‘lucid in all four directions, can you remain without knowledge?’”\n\nLaozi said: “Those who attend to life respond to change and act, for change arises with the times, following no constant course. Thus, ‘The *Dao* that can be spoken is not the eternal *Dao*; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’ Writing arises from words, and words emerge from knowledge. Yet the wise do not know—this is not the eternal *Dao*. The name that can be named is not that of the one who treasures the hidden. ‘To hear much is to reach exhaustion; better to guard the center.’ ‘Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow.’ ‘Abandon sagacity and discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.’\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this harms their nature. When things arrive and one responds, knowledge is set in motion. When knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. When likes and dislikes take form, knowledge is enticed outward and cannot return to the self, and Heavenly principle is extinguished. Therefore, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, externally transforming with things while inwardly remaining free of emotion. Thus, those who penetrate the *Dao* return to purity and stillness; those who empty themselves of things conclude in non-doing. With tranquility they nurture knowledge, with indifference they harmonize with the spirit, reaching the boundless. Following Heaven, they wander with the *Dao*; following man, they mingle with the vulgar. Therefore, the sage does not allow affairs to disturb Heaven, nor desires to disorder emotions. Without scheming, they are fitting; without speaking, they are trusted; without pondering, they obtain; without acting, they accomplish. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand before others, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the treacherous and perverse fear them. Because they do not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with them.”\n\nLaozi said: “When people follow desires, they lose their nature, and their movements are never correct. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to invite defilement. Those who have not heard the *Dao* cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain purity. Human nature is originally without depravity or filth. Long immersed in things, it changes; changing and forgetting its root, it merges with what seems like its nature. Water’s nature desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it. Human nature desires equilibrium, yet cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self.\n\nThus, the sage does not use knowledge to enslave things, nor desires to disturb harmony. Their joy is not exuberant, their sorrow not mournful. Therefore, they stand high without peril, rest secure without toppling. To hear good words and clever plans, even the foolish know to delight in them; to praise sagely virtue and lofty conduct, even the unworthy know to admire them. Those who speak of such things are many, but those who employ them are few; those who admire them are numerous, but those who practice them are scarce. The reason for this is being shackled by things and bound by custom.\n\nThus it is said: ‘I practice non-doing, and the people transform themselves. I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves. I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves. I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’ Purity and stillness are the utmost of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the *Dao*. The formless is vast, the formed is small; the formless is much, the formed is little; the formless is strong, the formed is weak; the formless is solid, the formed is hollow. The formed brings affairs to completion; the formless initiates beginnings. Completion produces vessels; beginnings preserve simplicity. The formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed arises from the formless—thus, the formless is the beginning of the formed.\n\nBroad and thick things have names—those with names are prized for wholeness. Meager and thin things have no names—those without names are base and light. Abundance and wealth have names—those with names are honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity have no names—those without names are lowly and weak. The male and potent have names—those with names are illustrious and bright. The female and yielding have no names—those without names are subtle and restrained. Surplus has names—those with names are exalted and wise. Deficiency has no names—those without names are assigned to lowly tasks. Merit produces names; lack of merit produces no names. Names arise from the nameless—the nameless is the mother of names. The *Dao* of Heaven generates being from non-being, completes the difficult through the easy. Therefore, the sage holds to the *Dao*, employing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and wonder to perfect virtue. Thus, with the *Dao* there is virtue; with virtue there is merit; with merit there is name; with name there is a return to the *Dao*. Merit and name endure long, and one remains free of blame throughout life. Kings and dukes have merit and name; the orphaned and widowed have no merit and name. Thus, the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to the root.”\n\nThe accomplished does not claim possession, thus merit becomes benefit, and namelessness becomes function.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their appearance did not depart from their nature, their words did not exceed their actions, their conduct required no adornment, and their speech was unembellished. Their clothing was plain, and those whose spiritual virtue was not fully embodied in themselves—how could distant forces corrupt them? Those who had forgotten the desire to harm within—even a starving tiger could be tailed by them, let alone other men.\n\nThose who embody the *Dao* find ease without exhaustion; those who rely on calculation labor without achievement. To govern by harsh laws and punishments is not the work of true kings and emperors. Frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to guide far-reaching governance. Excessive likes and dislikes invite misfortune to follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not created by them but inherited; their prohibitions and punishments were not enacted by them but upheld. Therefore, those who can inherit achieve greatness, while those who create achieve only the petty. Those who can uphold endure, while those who act invite failure.\n\nThose who rely on ears and eyes to listen and see exhaust the mind yet remain unclear. Those who govern by cunning and calculation strain the mind yet achieve nothing. Relying on the talents of one person is insufficient for perfect governance; the abilities of one person cannot cultivate even three acres.\n\nFollowing the principles of the *Dao* and aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth, even the Six Directions are not beyond equalization. Ears misled by praise and blame, eyes seduced by beauties—ritual and propriety are insufficient to restrain love, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Thus, nothing is more bitter than the will, yet the sword is but a lesser weapon; nothing is greater than yin and yang, yet drums and war horns are but trifles. The greatest bandits leave no trace of restraint in their slaughter; middle bandits hide in the mountains; petty bandits lurk among the people.\n\nThus it is said: When the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and robbers increase. Shifting from this to that, natural calamities do not arise.\n\nTherefore, governing a state with cunning is the state’s ruin; governing a state without cunning is the state’s virtue. Joy is the ancestor of the myriad things. When these three—cunning, calculation, and contrivance—are practiced, one sinks into formlessness.\n\nFormlessness is called *oneness*; oneness is the mind’s harmony with all under Heaven. Virtue is spread without overflow, employed without strain. It is seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. From formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five tones resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and fullness from emptiness.\n\nThe number of tones does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tones are beyond hearing. The number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting. The number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond seeing. When the *gong* tone is established, the five tones take shape; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; when whiteness is established, the five colors are complete; when the *Dao* is established, the myriad things are born.\n\nThus, the principle of *oneness* extends throughout the Four Seas; its blessing pervades Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is thick and uncarved like wood; in its dispersion, it is vast and turbid like muddy water. Turbid, it gradually clears; empty, it gradually fills. Vast and tranquil like the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly lost yet existing.\n\n*Laozi* said: The sum of the myriad things all passes through a single opening; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage follows a single standard, does not alter the ancient ways, and does not change the constant principles. They model themselves on the level and follow the plumb line, bending to accommodate the constant.\n\nJoy and anger are deviations from the *Dao*; sorrow and grief are losses of virtue; likes and dislikes are excesses of the mind; desires and cravings are burdens of life. Great anger harms *yin*; great joy harms *yang*. Weak *qi* causes muteness; terror induces madness. Sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness accumulates. If one can eliminate these five, they align with the divine luminaries.\n\nThe divine luminaries reside within; those who attain the within find their five viscera at peace, their thoughts calm, their ears and eyes keen, their sinews and bones strong. They are open and unobstructed without confusion, firm and unyielding without depletion. They neither exceed nor fall short.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the *Dao*. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable, its length infinite, its reach without limit. Its ebb and flow, its increase and decrease, surpass all calculation. Above, it becomes rain and dew; below, it moistens the earth. The myriad things cannot but live; the hundred affairs cannot but succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows blessings upon crawling creatures without seeking repayment. It enriches all under Heaven without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not harmed; severed, it is not cut; burned, it is not scorched. Soft and yielding, it flows without dissipation. It penetrates metal and stone, overcomes all under Heaven. Whether in excess or deficiency, it allows all to take or give. It receives the myriad things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, in vast equality with Heaven and Earth. This is called *supreme virtue*.\n\nWater achieves its supreme virtue through its simplicity, softness, and smoothness. Thus it is said: *\"The softest under Heaven rides the hardest under Heaven, entering where there is no gap.\"* Formlessness is the great ancestor of things; soundlessness is the great progenitor of categories. The *True Person* communicates with the numinous storehouse, becoming one with the Creator. Holding the *Mysterious Virtue* in the heart, their transformations are swift as spirit.\n\nThus, the *Dao* beyond *Dao* is vast and boundless. Before commands are issued, customs are already transformed—this is the power of the mind’s conduct. The myriad things have their origins, yet alone return to their root; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet alone guard their gate. Thus, they can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond to echoes without knowing.\n\n*Laozi* said: Those who attain the *Dao* have weak aspirations yet accomplish great deeds; their minds are empty yet their responses are fitting.\n\nThe one with weak aspirations is gentle, soft, tranquil, and serene, concealing themselves in non-acquisition, acting in incapacity. Serene and non-doing, their movements never miss their moment. Thus, \"the noble must take the humble as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation.\" Sheltering the small to embrace the great, residing within to govern without, acting with softness yet possessing hardness, their strength overcomes all enemies, none can surpass them. They respond to transformations and measure the times, so none can harm them. Those who desire hardness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what they accumulate, and you will know survival or demise. Hardness overcomes those weaker than oneself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes those stronger than oneself, its power immeasurable. Thus, \"when weapons are strong, they perish; when wood is strong, it breaks.\" Leather that is strong will split; teeth, though harder than the tongue, perish first. Therefore, \"the soft and weak are the stem of life, the hard and strong are the companions of death.\" The one who initiates is on the path to exhaustion; the one who follows attains the source of success.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, they control one another. How could they lose what controls others, and how could others control them? What is called \"following\" is adjusting to the measure and aligning with the time. When the time shifts, there is no gap for rest. To precede is to overreach; to follow is to fall short. The sun revolves, the moon cycles, time does not wait for man. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time, for time is hard to obtain yet easy to lose. Therefore, the sage acts in accordance with the time, establishes merit based on resources, upholds the pure Dao, adheres to the feminine principle, follows along to respond to change, always follows and never leads. Soft and weak in stillness, calm and composed in stability, even the greatest hardness cannot contend with them.\n\n*Laozi* said: When the heart harbors scheming, even purity is not unsullied. Their garments are warm yet without adornment; their weapons are blunt and without edges. They walk with hesitant steps, gaze with dim eyes, stand by the well to drink, till the fields to eat. They do not bestow, nor seek virtue. High and low do not vie; long and short do not compare. They follow the customs of the wind, adapt to the ease of affairs. Those who flaunt deceit to confuse the world, or act erratically to mislead the masses—the sage does not consider them part of the common way.\n\n**Chapter Two: Sincerity**\n\n*Laozi* said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun shines, the stars array themselves brightly; yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by rectifying their Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; rain and dew descend in season, yet do not nurture the grasses and trees. When spirit and clarity connect, yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, nests spirit in the heart, still and silent, joyful and harmonious in the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless. The government offices seem empty of affairs; the court appears devoid of people. There are no recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no resentful punishments. All under heaven look up to the ruler’s image and the sovereign’s intent. From distant lands and foreign customs, none fail to come through repeated translation—not because they visit every household and meet every person, but because the ruler extends their sincere heart to all under heaven.\n\nThus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is the proper command; what enables it to be carried out is sincerity. Though the command may be clear, it cannot act alone—it must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to cover the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity does not embrace them.\n\n*Laozi* said: Heaven sets the sun and moon, arrays the stars, extends the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. The day dries, the night rests, the wind desiccates, rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow; in destroying things, none see how they are lost, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this: in bestowing fortune, none see how it arises; in removing calamity, none see how it departs. Scrutiny finds nothing, investigation reveals no falsehood. Daily reckoning is insufficient, yearly reckoning is abundant. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is how the heart of heaven moves and transforms.\n\nWhen sincerity takes form within, qi stirs in heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. The rivers do not overflow, the seas do not surge. When one defies heaven and harms things, the sun and moon are eclipsed, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons conflict, day and night reverse their brightness, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, winter thunders, summer frosts.\n\nHeaven and man communicate with one another. Thus, when a state declines, celestial omens change; when the world is in chaos, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the affairs of spirit clarity cannot be achieved through cleverness or forced through strength.\n\nThus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, numinosity with ghosts and spirits, and trust with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, holding the qi of earth, grasping the central and containing harmony, they do not leave their hall yet traverse the four seas, transforming customs and habits. The people shift toward goodness as if born from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\n*Laozi* said: The Way of man is to preserve one’s nature and protect one’s authenticity, not harming one’s body. When encountering urgent difficulties, essence connects with heaven. If one has never departed from their origin, what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overpowered. How much more so for those who govern heaven and earth, embrace the myriad things, return to the Creator, and contain ultimate harmony—yet they have never truly died.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood externally in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When the sage is above, embracing the Dao without speaking, their virtue extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven. When spirit and qi respond, it is subtle indeed. This is called the eloquence of silence, the Dao beyond Dao.\n\nTo summon the distant, let there be non-action; to draw near, let speech be without affairs. Only those who walk in the night may attain this—turning back horses to manure fields, chariot tracks not reaching beyond distant lands. This is called \"sitting in stillness while racing afar, sinking into obscurity.\"\n\nThe Dao of Heaven approaches without partiality and departs without partiality. The capable have abundance; the deficient fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. Thus, governing by cleverness makes it difficult to sustain a state. Only those who align with the Great Harmony and uphold natural response can attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like a circle and its circumference—distance makes them near, proximity makes them obscure. Scrutinized, they cannot be grasped; examined, they are not empty. Therefore, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing, unaffected by things yet unharmed. What they gain is thus their loss; what they lose is thus their gain. Those who penetrate the Great Harmony are dim as if deeply drunk, sweetly reclining to wander within it—never having departed from their origin. This is called \"great penetration,\" where non-use is the very fulfillment of use.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed all under heaven by ordering the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, moderating the measures of the four seasons, correcting the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few, the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons yielded harvests without famine, officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors harmonized without blame, laws and decrees were clear and not obscure, assistants were just and not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets had no prearranged prices. In that era, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in due season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled all under heaven, he rested his head on a square pillow and slept on a straight mat, slaying autumn and restraining winter. Embracing the square earth and holding the round heaven, he dredged the obstructed passages where yin and yang stagnated, severed the perverse qi that harmed creatures and accumulated harm, and cut them off. His people were simple and ignorant, unaware of east or west, their vision dim, their steps unsteady, yet content in their innocence, knowing not whence they came. Floating and drifting, they knew not their origin, wandering aimlessly without direction. In that time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes—none failed to sheathe their claws and fangs, conceal their stings and poisons. Their merit equaled heaven and earth.\n\nYet when the Yellow Emperor retired to the ancestral temple, he did not display his achievements or proclaim his name, concealing the Way of the True Person to follow the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. How then did the Dao and virtue ascend, while cunning and artifice vanish?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the True Person does true wisdom arise. If what they uphold is not illuminated, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?\n\nAccumulating kindness and valuing wealth, making the myriad people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is *ren* (benevolence). Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, embodying ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior, clarifying close and distant, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the heirless—this is *yi* (righteousness). Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, abandoning cleverness and returning to unknowing, wandering hazily beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is *de* (virtue).\n\nThus, the Dao disperses into virtue; virtue overflows into *ren* and *yi*. When *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters, words become florid; when virtue dissipates, conduct turns false. When the utmost essence is dim within, yet words and actions are observed without—this is to be enslaved by things. Essence may be exhausted, but conduct has no end; what is guarded is unstable, and one is seduced by the winds of worldly custom. Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the Dao within and does not outwardly adorn *ren* and *yi*, knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs while roaming in the harmony of spirit. This is the sage’s wandering.\n\nLaozi said: As for the sage’s wandering—it moves in utmost emptiness, roams the mind in the Great Nothing, gallops beyond boundaries, walks through no gate, listens to no sound, sees no form, unbound by the world, unshackled by custom. Thus, what the sage uses to move all under heaven is not surpassed by the True Person; what the worthy use to rectify the age is not observed by the sage.\n\nThose bound by worldly custom must have their forms constrained and spirits drained, thus unable to avoid separation. If I can be constrained and bound, it is because my fate lies outside.\n\nLaozi said: The ruler’s thoughts—spirit does not gallop within the breast, wisdom does not extend beyond the four quarters. Embracing a heart of *ren* and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring births and summer grows, autumn harvests and winter stores. Monthly inspections and seasonal reviews, annual tributes presented, the people nurtured with impartiality, awe inspired with sincerity, laws simplified and not cumbersome, education as if by spirit, punishments lenient and prisons empty. All under heaven shares one custom, none harboring treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s thought.\n\nIf superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without yielding. The people grow poor and bitter, disputes arise; labor is toilsome yet fruitless. Cunning and deceit sprout; bandits and thieves multiply. Superiors and inferiors resent each other; decrees go unheeded. As muddy water makes fish gasp, harsh governance makes the people rebel. When superiors have many desires, inferiors grow deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors demand much, inferiors contend. Treating symptoms without addressing the root is no different from digging a ditch to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few yet governance is sought; little is done yet sufficiency abounds. Without acting, there is *ren*; without speaking, there is trust; without seeking, there is attainment; without striving, there is accomplishment. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost truth, holding the Dao and extending sincerity—all under heaven follows like an echo responding to sound, a shadow mimicking form. What they cultivate is the root.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and the mind’s deliberations churn within, one cannot govern the body. The farther the spirit is employed, the nearer what is abandoned. Thus, *\"Without stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven; without peering through the window, one knows the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"* This speaks of sincerity issuing from within and the spirit’s *qi* stirring heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The winter sun’s warmth, the summer sun’s coolness—all things turn to them yet none compel them. This is the utmost natural and perfect resonance: unsummoned, it comes; without departure, it goes. Subtle and obscure, its workings unknown, yet its achievements arise of themselves. If one must await sight to see or words to command, governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and the realm knew no cruel punishments—what need had he for speech? Shikuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and Jin knew no disordered governance—what need had he for sight? The command that requires no words, the vision that requires no eyes—this is how the sage becomes a teacher. The people’s transformation by their superiors follows not their words but their conduct. Thus, when a ruler favors valor, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many crises, and in time, there will surely be violent upheavals. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will grow chaotic, and over time, it will descend into debauchery and disorder. Therefore, the sage’s sincerity is distinguished within, and his likes and dislikes are clear without. His words match his feelings, and his decrees clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy. Only spiritual transformation is prized. Perfection in essence is spirit; where essence moves, it is like the spring’s growth or the autumn’s withering.\n\nThus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hairsbreadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nLaozi said: Though laws are hung and rewards set, customs cannot be changed if sincerity is not embraced. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their character; observing their music reveals their customs; seeing their customs reveals their transformation. Those who hold to truth and offer sincerity move heaven and earth, and their spirit transcends all bounds. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions heeded. Sincerity penetrates the Dao and conveys its intent—though not a word is spoken, the myriad people, beasts, and spirits of heaven and earth transform with it. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next best ensures none dare do wrong; the lowest rewards the worthy and punishes the violent.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action is non-possession. What does not possess does not abide; what does not abide dwells in formlessness. Formless, it does not move; motionless, it does not speak. Speechless, it is still and without sound or form—soundless and formless, it cannot be seen or heard. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit, *\"continuous yet ever-present,\"* *\"the root of heaven and earth.\"* The Dao is soundless, so the sage strives to give it form, using a single phrase to name the Dao of heaven and earth. The great takes the small as its root; the many take the few as their beginning. The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are vast, his power and name supreme. The beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth, so he must not fail to follow the Great Dao as the mother of all under heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent gives rise to fame and profit; removing harm brings success. In an age without disasters, even the sage has no virtue to display; when superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, and extends boundless wisdom. Though he rests in silence and does not speak, all under heaven esteem his wordlessness. Thus, *\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* What is inscribed on bamboo and silk or carved in metal and stone—what can be transmitted to others—is but its coarse aspect.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different paths yet shared the same heart; they took different routes yet reached the same destination. Scholars of later ages, not knowing the embodiment of the Dao or the essential unity of virtue, seize upon the traces of past achievements, kneeling and discoursing upon them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of. The sage, without leaving his seat, sets all under heaven right. His feeling is more urgent than a cry for help. Thus, when words are the same, trust precedes them; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond them. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit. When feeling precedes action, yet the above moves and the below does not respond, it is because feeling and command differ.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet a loving mother’s care for it grows ever deeper—this is feeling. Thus, the use of words brings change, but the change is small; the use of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trust is the noble person’s word; loyalty, their intent. Loyalty and trust take shape within and move others without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—these are not done to seek fame but because devotion resides within and does not shrink from peril. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned but arises from within. One must also examine their conduct. The sage is not ashamed of his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. To abandon the near and seek the far is to block the way.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, they long for his intent, never forgetting the desire to benefit others.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior cries out, the three armies part. If his cry’s sincerity is met with no response, if his intent is not carried, there must be discord within. One who sets all under heaven right without leaving his seat seeks it within himself. Thus, where persuasion does not reach, countenance does; where countenance does not reach, subtle influence does. When feeling stirs the heart and takes form, the utmost essence can be met in form, though it cannot be foreseen.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their root, affairs have their foundation. Lose their root and foundation, and though one’s skills be many, it is better to speak little. Harm the many by showing off Zhuī’s craft, severing his fingers to prove that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise artisan works not by ability but by timing, closing when he does not know how to close, and so must block before he opens.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths but reach the same end; survival and ruin, stability and collapse are as one to him, for his intent never forgets the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in transmission yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Song is the subtle manifestation of joy, weeping the outward sign of grief. What stirs within is expressed without, and so lies the power to move others. The sage’s heart day and night never forgets the desire to benefit others, and the reach of his virtue extends far indeed.\n\nLaozi said: When people govern through non-action, action only brings harm. To govern through non-action is to act as though not acting; those who act cannot achieve non-action, and those who cannot achieve non-action cannot act. When people speak not, their spirit is whole; when they speak, their spirit is harmed. Those who lack spirit in silence carry no silence, and so harm the spirit of those who possess it.\n\nWenzi said: A name may be forcibly established, merit forcibly achieved. Once, Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent in himself alone. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit became enlightened, his obstructions dissolved, and his diligence was such that for ten days he ate nothing, yet felt as though feasting on a grand sacrifice. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured through later generations, his wisdom spanned heaven and earth, and his discernment reached the finest detail. His praises resounded in elegant speech, ceaseless even today—this is what it means for a name to be forcibly established. Thus, if farmers do not strive, their granaries will not fill; if officials do not exert themselves, their sincerity will not be refined; if generals and ministers do not press forward, their achievements will not be realized; if kings and lords grow lax, they will drift through the age without renown.\n\nThe perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. He acts in accord with the times, achieves merit through available resources, advances and retreats without difficulty, and encounters no obstruction. The perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and his virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, he grieves as though in mourning.\n\nThus, “One who grieves for the people’s grief, the people will grieve for his grief; one who rejoices in the people’s joy, the people will rejoice in his joy. Therefore, to grieve with all under heaven and rejoice with all under heaven—yet not become king, such a thing has never been.”\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. It abides in an unshakable place, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and is borne in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue like the source of flowing water, placing the people in offices where no contention arises. He opens doors that must be entered, does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain long, and does not act where he cannot return.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings joy, and none do not follow his command. When command is followed, obedience ensues, and the small leads to the great. When command is resisted, good becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\nThe so-called great person is strong within and radiant without. Strong within like heaven and earth, radiant without like sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without exception; sun and moon illuminate all without fail. The great person shows goodness to others without altering his principles or changing his constancy. All under heaven heed his command as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance errs in spring, Jupiter’s movement waxes and wanes, not abiding in its regular path. When governance errs in summer, Mars retrogrades. When governance errs in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its comings and goings irregular. When governance errs in winter, Mercury does not manifest in its proper quarter. When governance fails in all four seasons, Saturn sways and trembles, sun and moon show omens, the five planets move in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish. When summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper. When winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being.\n\nScroll Three: Nine Safeguards\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was profound obscurity, a primordial unity, silent and limpid. The heavy and turbid congealed into earth; the pure and subtle ascended as heaven. Separating, they became the four seasons; dividing, they became yin and yang. Refined qi formed humans; coarse qi formed insects. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, undistracted by others. Heaven is father, earth is mother; yin and yang are the warp, the four seasons the weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. All things that oppose this perish; those that accord with it live. Thus stillness and emptiness are the abode of spirit and luminosity; void and nothingness are where the Dao resides.\n\nSpirit is what one receives from heaven; bones and flesh are what one is endowed with from earth. *\"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang; through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.\"*\n\nLaozi said: Humans are born through the transformations of heaven and earth. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera take shape. The liver governs the eyes; the kidneys, the ears; the spleen, the tongue; the lungs, the nose; the gallbladder, the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior, the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder is clouds; the lungs, qi; the spleen, wind; the kidneys, rain; the liver, thunder. Humans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs all.\n\nThe eyes and ears are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon deviate from their paths, they are eclipsed and lose their light. When wind and rain come unseasonably, they bring destruction and disaster. When the five planets stray from their courses, states and regions suffer calamity. The Dao of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and luminosity. How then can human ears and eyes endure prolonged stimulation without rest? How can spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external.\n\nBlood and qi are the glory of humans; the five viscera are their essence. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and vision are sharp—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart from it, qi and intention prevail, conduct is not perverse, spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus one hears all without fail, sees all without obstruction, and accomplishes all without hindrance. Misfortune and disaster have no way to enter; sorrowful qi cannot assail. Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who perceive the great know little.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Thus when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and spirit gallops without restraint. Though fortune and misfortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to perceive them. Thus the sage cherishes and does not transgress.\n\nIf the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, undistracted by temptations, and that intention and qi are not lost to tranquility and few desires, the five viscera will be at peace. When spirit guards the form internally and does not stray, one can observe beyond past ages and within future affairs, and the boundary between fortune and misfortune becomes as nothing. Thus the farther one ventures, the less one knows. This is to say that spirit must not be allowed to indulge externally.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores. Pursuits and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Thus desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes make spirit weary. If one does not swiftly eliminate them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish.\n\nThe reason humans cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is due to the excess of life-sustaining indulgences. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to can attain longevity. Heaven and earth move and interconnect; the myriad things are gathered into one. One who knows the One knows all; one who does not know the One knows nothing. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and all things are likewise things. How can things be distinguished from one another? Desire for life cannot be served; aversion to death cannot be refused. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling into tranquility, not daring to go to extremes—this is the utmost joy.\n\nTo guard emptiness: Laozi said: The so-called sage adapts to the times and finds peace in his position, engages with the world and delights in his work. Grief and joy are perversions of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the movement of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. In stillness, one harmonizes with yin and virtue; in movement, one aligns with yang and its currents. Thus the heart is the master of the form; spirit is the treasure of the heart. If the form labors without rest, it stumbles; if spirit is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore the sage follows this and does not dare transgress.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, one must thoroughly investigate principle; receiving the solid with the void, one must exhaust its limits. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, one fulfills one’s destiny. Without attachment, without partiality, embracing virtue and warming harmony, one accords with heaven. One’s boundary is the Dao; one’s neighbor is virtue. Not initiating fortune, not preceding misfortune, life and death bring no change to oneself—this is called utmost spirit.\n\nThe spirit seeks nothing it does not await, and thus nothing is left unaccomplished. In guarding the void, Laozi says: \"Lighten the world, and the spirit is unburdened; refine the myriad things, and the heart is undeluded. Equalize life and death, and the mind is unafraid; harmonize with transformation, and clarity is unswayed.\"\n\nThe utmost person leans upon an unyielding pillar, walks an unbounded path, draws from an inexhaustible store, and studies an undying teacher. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nothing they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace fate without confusion, turning and adapting. Misfortune and fortune, benefit and harm are insufficient to trouble their heart.\n\nThose who act with righteousness may be pressed with benevolence but cannot be coerced with arms; they may be guided with justice but cannot be lured with profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or honor; those who act with righteousness cannot be frightened by death or peril—how much more so for those who practice non-action!\n\nThe one who practices non-action is without burden. The unburdened person takes the world as their shadow and pillar. Gazing upward at the ranks of the utmost persons, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining below the conduct of the vulgar world, they find it sufficient to feel shame. Those who do not take the world as their concern treat learning like a drum beaten in vain.\n\nIn guarding equilibrium, Laozi says: \"Esteem and thick profit are what people covet, yet compared to the self, they are base. Thus the sage eats enough to fill the void and join qi, wears enough to cover the form and ward off cold, satisfies desires and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundantly. The eyes do not see, the ears do not hear, the mouth does not speak, the heart does not ponder. Abandoning cleverness and returning to simplicity, resting the spirit, discarding knowledge and habit, without likes or dislikes—this is called great penetration. To remove filth and cast off burdens, nothing compares to never having departed from one’s origin. What could not then be accomplished?\n\nOne who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured with profit; one who unites the inner and outer tally cannot be enticed with power. Beyond the external is the greatest; within the internal is the most noble. To know the greatest and most noble—where could one not succeed?\n\nIn guarding simplicity, Laozi says: \"The ancients who practiced the Dao regulated emotions and nature, cultivated the heart’s methods, nurtured with harmony, and maintained with moderation. They delighted in the Dao and forgot lowliness; their virtue was secure, and they forgot poverty. If nature has no desires, there is nothing desired that is not obtained; if the heart has no joys, there is no joy that is not pursued. What does not benefit nature is not used to burden virtue; what does not suit life is not used to disturb harmony.\n\nNot indulging the self or following whim but adhering to measure, one can serve as a model for the world. Measuring the belly to eat, shaping the form to clothe, fitting the body to dwell, and acting according to feeling, one leaves the world in surplus without possessing it and entrusts the myriad things without profiting from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness cause one to lose one’s nature and life? One who remains thus can be said to embody the Dao.\n\nIn guarding purity, Laozi says: \"Humans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes respond to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth to fragrances and odors, the skin to cold and warmth—these inclinations are one. Yet some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty. The difference lies in the restraints imposed.\n\nThe spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is balanced. No one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus, only when the spirit is clear and the mind balanced can one perceive the nature of things. Therefore, those who employ it must borrow from non-employment.\n\nA bright mirror is not sullied by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. When the heart reaches a point, the spirit is fully present; returning to emptiness, agitation subsides and stillness is stored—this is the wandering of the sage. Thus, those who govern the world must first thoroughly understand the nature of life and destiny.\n\nIn guarding authenticity, Laozi says: \"What is called the sage simply accords with feeling: measuring the belly to eat, gauging the form to clothe, restraining the self so that greedy and corrupt thoughts have no way to arise. Thus, one who can possess the world must not take the world as their own; one who can possess fame and reputation must not seek it through transgressive conduct. Truly understanding the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally follow.\n\nIf the spirit is unobscured and the heart unburdened, penetrating and unobstructed, serene and without affairs, then power and profit cannot lure, sounds and sights cannot seduce, eloquence cannot persuade, wisdom cannot move, and bravery cannot frighten—this is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThose who give life do not live; those who transform do not transform. One who does not grasp this Dao, though they comprehend heaven and earth, illuminate the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make words flow like metal and stone, still brings no benefit to the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what they guard.\n\nIn guarding stillness, Laozi says: \"Stillness, silence, tranquility, and indifference nurture life; harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one’s nature finds its proper place; still and unmoving, harmonious, virtue rests securely in its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to complete one’s years—this can be called embodying the Dao.\n\nOne who is thus has unobstructed blood and qi, no stagnant qi in the five viscera. Misfortune and fortune cannot disturb, praise and blame cannot sully. Without possessing the world, who could aid them? One with talent who does not meet their time cannot even free themselves—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nOne whose eyes discern the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; one whose ears attune to the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus, a small focus causes one to forget the great. Now, the myriad things assail, plucking at one’s life, seizing one’s essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive it, how is it possible?\n\nA basin of water, if clear for days, can reflect one’s eyebrows and lashes; if muddied by a single stir, it cannot show square or round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy—just like the basin of water.\"\n\nThe Dao of Upholding the Law\nLaozi said: The highest sages model themselves on Heaven; those next esteem worthies; those below employ ministers. To employ ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to esteem worthies is the source of delusion and confusion; to model oneself on Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness reign supreme: emptiness receives all, stillness sustains all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus, the sage takes stillness as order and movement as chaos. Therefore, it is said: Do not stir, do not disturb—all things will clarify themselves; do not alarm, do not frighten—all things will govern themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\nThe Dao of Guarding Weakness\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world or a state as their household and the myriad things as their livestock. Embracing the world’s vastness and possessing the multitude of things, their qi becomes full and their ambitions arrogant. The great use force to invade the small; the small are haughty and domineering toward those below. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long.\n\nThus, the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and practicing non-action without harming the primal qi. Perceiving the small, they guard softness; withdrawing, they possess nothing, modeling themselves on rivers and seas. Rivers and seas do not act, yet their merit and fame transform naturally. Not forcing, they thus complete their kingship. Being the female of the world, their spirit does not die. Loving themselves, they thus achieve their nobility. With the power of ten thousand chariots and the myriad things as their merit and fame, their authority and responsibility are of the utmost weight—they cannot slight themselves. To slight oneself is to fail in merit and fame.\n\nThe Dao is great yet completed through the small, numerous yet ruled by the few. Thus, the sage guides the world with the Dao. Softness, weakness, subtlety, and minuteness are the perception of the small; frugality, thrift, reduction, and deficiency are the perception of the few. Perceiving the small, they thus complete the great; perceiving the few, they thus complete the beautiful.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess to supply insufficiency. Rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to and serves them. The sage is humble, modest, pure, still, and yielding—this is the perception of lowness. Emptying the heart and having nothing is the perception of insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, they thus attain their height; perceiving insufficiency, they thus complete their worthiness. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure; the aggressive perish; the overflowing are ruined. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last a day; small valleys cannot remain full for a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains carry the qi of aggression, thus they cannot last and perish. Small valleys occupy the terrain of aggression, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore, the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons extravagance and arrogance, and dares not act with aggressive qi. Holding to the female and the yielding, they thus establish their maleness and virility. Not daring to be extravagant and arrogant, they thus endure long.\n\nThus, Laozi said: The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—this is seen in the sun and moon. The sage daily diminishes, and the primal qi does not dare to fill itself; daily advancing with the female, their merit and virtue do not decline. This is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHuman emotions and natures all favor the high and dislike the low, favor gain and dislike loss, favor profit and dislike harm, favor honor and dislike humility, favor nobility and dislike baseness. The multitude act accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; clinging to these, they cannot attain.\n\nThus, the sage models themselves on Heaven, accomplishing without acting and attaining without grasping. Sharing the same emotions as others yet following a different Dao, they thus endure long.\n\nTherefore, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called the \"admonishing goblet.\" When empty, it stands upright; when full, it overturns.\n\nAll things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its fullness wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Thus, the keen of hearing and sharp of sight guard themselves with foolishness; the learned and eloquent guard themselves with frugality; the martial and brave guard themselves with awe; the rich and powerful guard themselves with narrowness; those whose virtue extends to the world guard themselves with yielding. These five are how the former kings guarded the world.\n\n\"Those who practice this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one remain whole without renewal.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage is at ease with yin and open with yang, able to reach the state of no joy—thus there is nothing not joyful. Being nothing not joyful is the ultimate joy. Therefore, inner joy is externalized, not the reverse. Thus, one has self-joy and self-worth, esteeming the world. The reason is that they grasp the world’s essentials.\n\nIt does not lie in others but in oneself; not in people but in one’s own body. When the body attains it, the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, those who master the discourse on the arts of the heart have desires and aversions externalized. Therefore, they have no joy, no anger, no pleasure, no suffering. The myriad things are profoundly united, without right or wrong.\n\nThus, the scholar has unchanging principles; the woman has unalterable conduct. They do not rely on power to be honored, nor on wealth to be rich, nor on force to be strong. They do not value goods and wealth, do not covet worldly fame, do not find security in nobility, nor danger in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nForm is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life. If one loses their proper place, all three are harmed. Thus, those who take spirit as their master have form following and benefiting; those who take form as their controller have spirit following and harming.\n\nThose who live with greed, rapacity, and many desires are most suited to power and profit, enticed and admiring of fame and position. Almost surpassing others in wisdom, their position elevated above the world, their spirit daily dissipates and drifts far away. Long indulging without returning, their form is idle and their center blocked—there is no way in. Thus, they often suffer from blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, will, and qi: when still, they daily fill and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Thus, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and weakens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, and floats and sinks with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things have nothing that does not correspond, and the changes of a hundred affairs have nothing that does not respond.\n\nThe Dao of Guarding Simplicity\nLaozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature harmonizes with the Dao.\n\nThus, to possess yet seem as though without, to be full yet seem as though empty—cultivate the inner and not the outer. Comprehend the Great Simplicity, act without contrivance and return to uncarved simplicity. Embrace the root and hold fast to spirit, roaming the root of Heaven and Earth. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. Schemes, wit, and cunning are not carried in the heart. Discerning the unborrowed, one does not shift with things. Perceiving the transformations of affairs, one guards their origin. The heart’s intent is focused within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Dwelling without knowing what one does, moving without knowing where one goes. Knowing without learning, seeing without looking, accomplishing without acting, distinguishing without governing. Responding to stimuli, moving under compulsion, proceeding only when unavoidable—like light shining, like a shadow following. Following the Dao as one’s guide, depending on conditions to be so. Vast and empty, clear and still, without anything. Taking a thousand births as one transformation, taking ten thousand differences as one origin.\n\nThere is essence yet it is not employed; there is spirit yet it is not used. Guarding the great undifferentiated simplicity, standing at the center of utmost purity. In sleep, no dreams; in thought, no sprouting. In movement, no form; in stillness, no body. Existing yet seeming to vanish, living yet seeming to die. Entering and exiting without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits. What spirit and essence can ascend and borrow from the thousand Dao.\n\nLet spirit flow freely without losing its origin. Day and night without interruption, harmonizing with things as spring. This is to unite and give birth to time within the heart.\n\nThus, the form may decay, yet the spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation without transforming, endlessly turning through a thousand changes without beginning or end. What transforms returns to formlessness; what does not transform is born together with Heaven and Earth. Those born together with Heaven and Earth never transform what they transform—this is the True Person’s roaming in the pure and unadorned Dao.\n\n**Chapter Four: Accordant Sayings**\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It envelops Heaven and Earth without inside or outside, pervades and covers without obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao is neither angered nor delighted. Seated, without anxiety; asleep, without dreams. Seeing things, they name them; affairs arrive, they respond.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame as their corpse must generate affairs. Affairs arise, and they abandon the public for the private, forsake the Dao to rely on themselves. Seeing praise, they perform good deeds; establishing themselves, they become worthy. Thus, governance does not follow principle, and affairs do not accord with the times. Governance that does not follow principle brings much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Acting recklessly to hit the mark, success is insufficient to absolve blame, while failure is enough to destroy the self.\n\nLaozi said: Do not be the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of cunning.\n\nConceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move only when unavoidable. Desire fortune, first avoid misfortune; desire benefit, first distance harm.\n\nThus, one who attains tranquility through non-action—losing that tranquility, they face peril. One who governs through non-action—losing that governance, they face chaos. Therefore, “Do not desire to be bustling like jade, nor aloof like stone.”\n\nFine patterns invite flaying; beautiful horns invite slaughter. Sweet springs must dry up; straight trees must be felled. Florid words later become transgressions. Stones bearing jade harm their mountains; the people’s calamities are rooted in speech.\n\nLaozi said: Act in accord with the times, yet those who do not know the Dao turn fortune into misfortune.\n\nHeaven as the canopy, Earth as the crossbar—those who skillfully use the Dao never come to an end. Earth as the crossbar, Heaven as the canopy—those who skillfully use the Dao never suffer harm.\n\nDisplaying the five phases, there must be conquest. What Heaven covers is without exception fitting. Thus, “To know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.”\n\nLaozi said: Mountains bear metal, stones bear jade—they mutually erode. Trees bear insects, which return to consume them. People create affairs, which return to harm them.\n\nThose who love affairs are never without fault; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Skilled swimmers drown; skilled riders fall. Each suffers calamity through their own loves.\n\nAttainment lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth dwells below without contending for height—thus it is secure and not imperiled. Water flows downward without contending for speed—thus it departs and is not delayed.\n\n“Thus, the sage has no attachments and so no losses, acts without contrivance and so no defeats.”\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the world’s foundation. Three words make a feudal lord mighty; four words make the world a pair.\n\nIntegrity and trustworthiness cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the world’s foundation. Exalting worthy virtue makes a feudal lord mighty; detesting the few and loving the many makes the world a pair.\n\nLaozi said: People suffer three deaths not by fate: immoderate eating and drinking, belittling the body—disease kills them together. Unrestrained pleasure and endless desire—punishment kills them together. Attacking the many with the few, bullying the strong with the weak—weapons kill them together.\n\nLaozi said: Generous giving yields beautiful recompense; great resentment yields deep misfortune. Giving little yet expecting much, harboring resentment yet hoping for no calamity—such has never been.\n\nExamine what has gone, and you will know what is to come.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the Mandate of Heaven, cultivate the heart’s methods, order likes and dislikes, adapt to temperament—then the Dao of governance is unobstructed.\n\nTracing the Mandate of Heaven, one is not deluded by fortune and misfortune. Cultivating the heart’s methods, one does not recklessly rejoice or anger. Ordering likes and dislikes, one does not covet the useless. Adapting to temperament, desires do not exceed measure.\n\nNot deluded by fortune and misfortune, movement and stillness follow; not recklessly rejoicing or angering, rewards and punishments are not biased. Not coveting the useless, one does not harm their nature with desires. Desires not exceeding measure, one nurtures life and knows contentment. In all these four, one does not seek from without nor borrow from others—turning inward, they attain it.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue actions that can be criticized; do not resent others’ criticisms of oneself. Cultivate virtues that suffice for praise; do not seek others’ praise of oneself.\n\nNot able to prevent misfortune from arriving, one trusts in one’s own lack of wisdom; not able to ensure fortune’s certain coming, one trusts in one’s own lack of presumption. Misfortune’s arrival is not of one’s own making, thus one is impoverished yet not anxious; fortune’s coming is not of one’s own achievement, thus one is prosperous yet not arrogant. Therefore, dwelling in leisure, the heart is joyful; acting without contrivance, order prevails.\n\nLaozi said: The Daoist guards what they already possess and does not seek what they do not yet have. Seeking what one has not yet obtained, what one already possesses is lost; cultivating what one already has, what one desires arrives.\n\nGoverning is not secured by preventing disorder, yet those who act to govern inevitably court peril. Conduct is not exempt from wrongdoing, yet those who hastily seek fame inevitably suffer harm. Thus, no fortune surpasses the absence of misfortune, no benefit surpasses the absence of loss. Hence, “Things may be augmented yet diminished, diminished yet augmented.”\n\nThe Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue profit, yet it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Thus, one may taste the absence of misfortune but not the presence of fortune; one may taste the absence of guilt but not the presence of merit. The Dao is said to be vast and obscure, following Heaven’s majesty. In harmony with Heaven’s qi, it is without thought or planning, without preparation or storage. What comes is not welcomed; what goes is not pursued. Though people move east, west, south, or north, one stands alone at the center.\n\nThus, amidst crooked multitudes, one does not lose their straightness. Flowing with the world, one does not depart from their domain. Neither pursuing goodness nor avoiding ugliness, one follows Heaven’s Dao. Not initiating, not monopolizing the self, one follows Heaven’s principles. Without premeditation, without forsaking the times, one takes Heaven as their measure. Not seeking gain, not refusing fortune, one follows Heaven’s norms. Within, no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise, and how could there be harm from others?\n\nTherefore, the highest virtue speaks as if offering bribes, acts as if bestowing favors. Above and below share one heart, without divergent paths or peripheral distractions. Rejecting the devious, opening the way to goodness, the people turn toward uprightness.\n\nLaozi said: To do good is to encourage; to do evil is to observe. Encouragement breeds responsibility; observation breeds trouble. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame but can be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor praise through knowledge and perception. Governance follows nature; the self has no part in it. Those who act may not succeed; those who seek may not obtain. People may be obstructed, yet the Dao is never blocked. Those with wisdom yet acting without contrivance achieve the same merit as the unwise; those with ability yet acting without effort attain the same virtue as the incapable. Having wisdom yet appearing unwise, having ability yet appearing incapable—when the Dao’s principles are realized, human talent fades.\n\nPeople and the Dao cannot both be illustrious. When people love fame, they do not employ the Dao; when the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao ceases and human fame flourishes, peril and ruin follow.\n\nLaozi said: If trustworthy men were to distribute wealth, it would be better to determine shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intent are less just than those without. If incorruptible men were to guard wealth, it would be better to seal it behind closed doors. Why? Those with desire are less incorruptible than those without.\n\nPeople resent those who point out their flaws and delight in seeing their own ugliness reflected. One who engages with things without entangling the self is free from burdens.\n\nLaozi said: In all dealings with others, if not with treasures or goods, then with humble words. Yet meager gifts cannot satisfy desire, and submissive speech cannot forge lasting bonds. Oaths and pledges, once made, are broken before the day is done. Thus, the noble person does not adorn themselves with external benevolence and righteousness but inwardly cultivates the Dao and its arts. They attend to affairs within their domain, exhaust its resources, encourage the people to hold fast to death, and fortify their walls. Above and below united in heart, they defend the altars of state. Thus, those who feign virtue do not attack the innocent; those who seek profit do not assault the unobtainable. This is the way of certain preservation, the principle of assured benefit.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome their heart; the multitude does not overcome their desires. The noble person embodies upright qi; the petty person embodies perverse qi. What inwardly accords with one’s nature and outwardly aligns with righteousness, moving in accordance with principle and not bound to things—this is upright qi. Indulging in rich flavors, excessive in sounds and sights, acting on joy and anger without regard for future harm—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright injure one another; desire and nature harm one another. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Thus, the sage abandons desire and follows nature.\n\nThe eye delights in beauty, the ear in sound, the nose in fragrance, the mouth in flavor. Combined, these pleasures cannot be separated from benefit and harm—these are desires. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; the heart governs them all, each attaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desires cannot be overcome.\n\nLaozi said: Those who cultivate the self and nurture their nature regulate their rest and activity, moderate their food and drink, harmonize their joy and anger, and adapt their movement and stillness. What lies within the self is attained, and perverse qi has no way to enter. Adorning the external harms the internal; indulging the emotions harms the spirit. What appears refined obscures the true. Those who never forget their pursuit of worthiness inevitably exhaust their nature; those who forget their appearance even for a hundred paces inevitably burden their form. Thus, beautiful plumage harms the bones; lush branches and leaves harm the roots. One who can perfect both is nowhere to be found in the world.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven has its brightness and does not worry over the people’s darkness; Earth has its wealth and does not worry over the people’s poverty. Those who embody the highest virtue and Dao are like mountains, towering and unmoving. Travelers take them as their guide. Upright in themselves, they suffice for others. They do not bestow gifts upon people, nor do those who use them receive their virtue. Thus, they are at peace and endure long.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not interfere, thus they do not seize; they do not claim virtue, thus they do not incur resentment. Those who are quick to anger inevitably accumulate grievances; those who are quick to give inevitably invite seizure. Only by following Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity can one master principle.\n\nThus, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil accompanies it. Profit is the beginning of harm; fortune is the precursor of misfortune. Not seeking profit, one avoids harm; not seeking fortune, one avoids misfortune. The body’s constancy lies in wholeness; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nLaozi said: The sage wears no extravagant garments, nor performs eccentric deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious. He is unassuming yet not coarse, steadfast yet not intimidated, honored yet not ostentatious, reclusive yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In their common use, no name suffices—this is called the Great Permeation.\n\nLaozi said: The Daoist aligns himself and awaits destiny. When the time arrives, one cannot hasten it by rushing forward; when it departs, one cannot grasp it by clinging. Thus, the sage neither advances in pursuit nor retreats in deference. For three years, he follows the time; when the time departs, he withdraws. For three years after it leaves, the time remains behind him. Neither approaching nor receding, he stands at the center of his place.\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it aligns only with virtue. When fortune arrives, it is not sought, so one does not boast of merit; when misfortune comes, it is not self-inflicted, so one does not regret conduct. The heart remains serene, unburdened by virtue. Dogs may bark, but he is not startled; he trusts his nature, his sincerity free from impropriety. Thus, those who master the Dao are not deluded, and those who understand destiny are not anxious.\n\nWhen emperors and kings pass, their remains are interred in the wilds, yet their sacrifices are conducted in the Bright Hall. The spirit is prized above the form. Thus, when the spirit governs the form, it obeys; when the form overpowers the spirit, it falters. Though hearing and sight are employed, they must return to the spirit—this is called the Great Permeation.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness, so their names did not sway their resolve. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty, so profit did not disturb their hearts. Thus, they were humble yet joyful, tranquil yet content.\n\nTo fret over the world’s chaos while calculating one’s lifespan is like weeping to replenish a drying river—it only adds to the sorrow. Therefore, those who do not worry over the world’s disorder but delight in their own governance may be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: People harbor three resentments—those with high rank are envied, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with ample emoluments are resented. Thus, as rank rises, humility must deepen; as office grows, the heart must shrink; as emoluments increase, generosity must broaden. Cultivating these three prevents resentment. Therefore, nobility takes lowliness as its root, and height takes lowness as its foundation.\n\nLaozi said: Speech serves to convey oneself to others; hearing serves to convey others to their ends. If one is deaf to what is heard, the human way is obstructed. Those afflicted with deafness know not how to conduct affairs—yet this is not merely a malady of the body. The heart, too, may be blocked, unaware of its own obstruction. This is akin to deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao, as the origin, gives life to all that has form. Its intimacy is profound. Those who feast on grains and consume qi attain longevity—its lordship is benevolent. All the wise study it—its teaching is luminous. Yet people often harm what is useful by deeming it useless. Thus, knowledge is not broadened, and days are insufficient. To spend one’s days in games and gambling while inquiring of the Dao—though one’s learning may deepen, whether one asks or not, it is like comparing the deaf and blind to others.\n\nLaozi said: Human nature submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue lies in giving, not in receiving. Thus, the sage who wishes to be esteemed by others first esteems them; who wishes to be exalted by others first exalts them; who wishes to surpass others first surpasses himself; who wishes to humble others first humbles himself. Therefore, nobility and baseness, exaltation and humility are governed by the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings spoke humbly to others and placed themselves behind them. Thus, the world joyfully upheld them without tiring, bearing them without burden. Their virtue was abundant, their qi harmonious. Thus, to know that giving is receiving and that placing oneself after is advancement is to draw near the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Those with little virtue yet much favor invite ridicule; those with mediocre talent yet high position court danger; those with no great merit yet ample emoluments invite peril. Thus, some things are increased yet diminished, or diminished yet increased. The multitude knows only to seek profit and avoid harm, but the sage knows that harm can be profit, and profit can be harm. Therefore, a tree that bears fruit twice will damage its roots; a family that excavates its treasures will bring calamity upon its descendants. Great profit may turn to harm—such is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The petty person acts for mere gain; the noble person acts for mere righteousness. Those who do good do not seek fame, yet fame follows. Fame does not arrange to bring profit, yet profit accrues. Their aims may be the same, but their ends differ. Thus, every action that brings benefit is followed by harm.\n\nThose whose words lack constancy and whose deeds lack propriety are petty persons. Those discerning in one matter and skilled in one ability are mediocre. Those who encompass all and possess manifold talents, employing them as needed, are sages.\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, in an orderly age, one defends oneself with righteousness; in a chaotic age, one defends righteousness with oneself. The day of death is the end of conduct. Therefore, the noble person is cautious in its singular application.\n\nLife is bestowed by Heaven; destiny is encountered in time. To possess talent yet not meet one’s era is fate. Seek it by proper means, but attain it by destiny. The noble person can do good yet cannot ensure fortune; he may refrain from wrongdoing yet cannot avoid misfortune. Thus, when the noble person encounters the times, he advances, obtaining it through righteousness—what luck is there in that? When the times do not favor him, he retreats, yielding with propriety—what misfortune is there in that? Therefore, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he does not regret, for he has attained what he values.\n\nLaozi said: People possess the qi of compliance and defiance, born of the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi flows smoothly; when the heart is disordered, qi rebels. The order or disorder of the heart lies in morality. Attain the Dao, and the heart is ordered; lose the Dao, and the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, interactions are yielding; when disordered, they are contentious. Yielding cultivates virtue; contention breeds harm. Virtue smooths the qi; harm disrupts it. Smooth qi diminishes the self to serve others; disrupted qi diminishes others to serve the self. These two qi can be guided and controlled.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to sound—virtue accumulates and fortune arises; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises. Offices fail when offices flourish; filial piety wanes with wife and children. Calamity arises from the dissolution of care; illness worsens when near recovery. Thus, *\"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and nothing will be ruined.\"*\n\nLaozi said: When the crooked and the straight are promoted together, how can one not err? When the straight are promoted alongside the crooked, do not proceed with them—this is what is meant by *\"sharing the same filth yet differing in mud.\"*\n\nLaozi said: The sage regards death and life as one; the foolish also regard death and life as one, yet they do not harmonize with where benefit and harm lie.\n\nThe Dao hangs in the heavens; the ten thousand things spread upon the earth; harmony resides in man. If the ruler of men is not in harmony, the qi of Heaven does not descend, the qi of Earth does not ascend, yin and yang are not regulated, wind and rain do not come in season, and the people suffer illness and hunger.\n\nLaozi said: To command the troops of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing a single fitting word. To obtain the Pearl of Marquis Sui is not as good as grasping the origin of affairs. To obtain the Jade Disc of He is not as good as attaining the proper course of affairs. Though the world is vast, those who delight in using arms perish; though a state is secure, those who delight in war are imperiled. Thus, *\"Let there be a small state with few people, where tools of war exist but are not employed.\"*\n\nLaozi said: One who can become a hegemon or king must be a victor; one who can defeat the enemy must be strong; one who can be strong must employ the strength of others; one who can employ the strength of others must win the hearts of the people; one who can win the hearts of the people must first be self-possessed; one who is self-possessed must be yielding and weak.\n\nTo defeat those not equal to oneself is to meet one’s match in those who are; yielding overcomes those who are equal to oneself—its workings cannot be measured. Thus, one who can unite the many who are not victorious achieves great victory.\n\n*Scroll Five: Virtue and the Dao*\n\nWenzi asked about the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: When learning is not refined, the hearing of the Dao is not profound. All who listen do so to attain wisdom, to perfect conduct, and to achieve merit and renown. Without refinement, there is no clarity; without depth, there is no penetration. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with the spirit; in middling learning, with the heart; in inferior learning, with the ears. Those who listen with the ears learn only to the skin; those who listen with the heart learn to the flesh; those who listen with the spirit learn to the marrow. If one’s hearing is not profound, one’s knowledge will not be clear; if one’s knowledge is not clear, one cannot fully grasp its essence; if one cannot fully grasp its essence, one’s conduct will not be perfected.\n\nThe principle of listening lies in emptiness of heart and tranquility, in diminishing qi without excess, in being free from thought and worry, in the eyes not gazing recklessly, in the ears not listening carelessly. Accumulate essence and store it steadily; once attained, guard it firmly and preserve it for long. The Dao is the origin and beginning of all things. It begins in softness and weakness, and is completed in hardness and strength; it begins in brevity and scarcity, and is completed in abundance and length. A tree of ten spans begins with a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below—this is the Way of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below, yielding is how one places oneself behind, frugality is how one begins small, and diminishing is how one begins with little. Thus, humility leads to honor, yielding leads to precedence, frugality leads to expansiveness, and diminishing leads to greatness—this is what the Way of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the source of virtue, the root of greatness, the gate of fortune. All things depend upon it to live, to be completed, and to find peace. The Dao is formless and without action; inwardly, it cultivates the self; outwardly, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and its affairs established, it stands beside Heaven. It is without action, yet nothing is left undone. None know its nature, none know its truth, yet within it there is reliability.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, the world submits, and his altars of soil and grain endure. When feudal lords possess the Dao, the people live in harmony, and their states are not lost. When scholars and commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their lives and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without fighting; when the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contending. When affairs are undertaken with the Dao, merit is achieved and fortune attained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness; when father and son possess the Dao, there is compassion and filial piety; when scholars and commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao, there is wisdom; without the Dao, there is pettiness. From this, it is clear that the Dao is fitting for all people in all things.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune. When practiced to its fullest, the world submits, and submission leads to cherishing. Thus, the emperor is the destination of the world, the king is the one to whom the world turns. If the world neither turns toward nor finds its destination in him, he cannot be called emperor or king. Therefore, an emperor or king who does not win the people cannot succeed; even if he wins the people but loses the Dao, he cannot preserve his rule.\n\nThose who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and haughty. They display their excesses, flaunt their brilliance, cling to dominance and rigidity, provoke difficulties, and sow enmity. They become instigators of war and leaders of chaos. When petty men practice this, they bring great calamity upon themselves; when great men practice it, their states perish. The harm may touch only themselves, or it may run deep, reaching their descendants. No crime is greater than being without the Dao, no resentment deeper than being without virtue—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: When Heaven acts through the Dao, even the brave cannot pierce, even the skillful cannot strike. Though they cannot pierce or strike, they may still bring humiliation—how much better to make it so that even the brave cannot pierce, even the skillful cannot strike. Those who dare not act are not without the intention; how much better to be without the intention at all. Those without the intention have no mind to receive harm or benefit—how much better to make it so that all men and women under Heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. If this is so, one may be a ruler without land, an official without office, and the world will wish nothing more than to bring peace and benefit to him. Thus, courage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life.\n\nWenzi asked about virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To nurture and cultivate, to bring to fruition and cause to grow, to benefit all without partiality, and to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue.\n\nWhat is benevolence? To act as a superior without boasting of one’s merit, to act as a subordinate without shame for one’s faults, to be great without arrogance, to be small without meanness, to love all without selfishness, and to remain steadfast without decline—this is called benevolence.\n\nWhat is righteousness? To act as a superior by aiding the weak, to act as a subordinate by maintaining integrity, to be successful without indulgence, to be impoverished without altering one’s principles, to follow the standard and accord with reason, and to avoid private bias and crookedness—this is called righteousness.\n\nWhat is propriety? To act as a superior with reverence and dignity, to act as a subordinate with humility and respect, to yield and remain gentle, to be the female of the world, to stand in non-daring, and to act from inability—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue leads subordinates to follow commands; cultivating benevolence leads them to cease contention; cultivating righteousness leads them to fairness and uprightness; cultivating propriety leads them to reverence. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure.\n\nThat which gives life is the Dao; that which causes growth is virtue; that which loves is benevolence; that which rectifies is righteousness; that which respects is propriety. Without nurturing and cultivation, there can be no fruition and growth; without kindness and love, there can be no completion; without rectification and correction, there can be no enduring; without respect and esteem, there can be no honor and weight. Thus, virtue is what the people value, benevolence is what they cherish, righteousness is what they fear, and propriety is what they revere. These four are the proper order of culture and the means by which the sage governs all things.\n\nWhen the noble man lacks virtue, his subordinates resent him; when he lacks benevolence, they contend with him; when he lacks righteousness, they become violent; when he lacks propriety, they fall into chaos. If these four principles are not established, it is called being without the Dao. There has never been one without the Dao who did not perish.\n\nLaozi said: In the age of utmost virtue, merchants thrive in their markets, farmers delight in their fields, ministers rest secure in their offices, recluses cultivate their Way, and the people rejoice in their labors. Thus, wind and rain do not destroy or break, grasses and trees do not wither prematurely, the Yellow River yields its Diagram, and the Luo River brings forth its Writ.\n\nYet when the age declines, taxes and levies know no limit, killing and slaughter know no end. Those who remonstrate are punished, and worthy scholars are executed. Thus, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, creeping things never rest, and the wilds yield no hundred herbs.\n\nTherefore, when the world is well-governed, even fools cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage harmonizes with joy and tranquility—this is life. The Way of utmost virtue prevails—this is fate. Thus, only when life encounters fate can it act; only when fate meets its time can it become manifest. There must first be the age, and only then can there be the man.\n\nWenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom.\nLaozi said: To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. The sage has heard of the origins of fortune and misfortune and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise one has seen fortune and misfortune take shape and chooses conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious of the heavenly Dao, thus understanding the origins of fortune and misfortune. The wise one foresees their formation, thus knowing the gateway of fortune and misfortune. To know before it arises is sagacity; to foresee its formation is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\n\nLaozi said: When a ruler favors righteousness, he trusts the times and relies on himself, wielding wisdom to employ kindness. Yet when things are vast and wisdom shallow, to sustain the vast with the shallow has never been possible. Relying solely on one’s wisdom, losses must be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhaustion; favoring courage is the way to peril and ruin. Favoring giving leads to no fixed allotment. If the superior’s allotment is not fixed, the subordinates’ expectations will never cease. If one levies heavily, one makes enemies of the people; if one takes little but gives much, there is no end to the reckoning. Thus, favoring giving is the way that invites resentment. From this, we see that wealth is not sufficient to rely upon, and the principles of the Dao become clear.\n\nWenzi asked: How did the kings of old govern the world with the Dao?\nLaozi said: They held to the One and practiced non-action, following the transformations of Heaven and Earth. \"The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped or made. Those who make it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\" Holding to the One is to perceive the small; because it is small, it can accomplish the great. Non-action is to maintain stillness; by maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in greatness, one is full yet does not overflow; dwelling in highness, one is noble yet not arrogant. Abiding in greatness without overflowing, one is full yet does not wane; dwelling above without arrogance, one is high yet not imperiled. Full yet not waning, one long preserves wealth; high yet not imperiled, one long preserves nobility. Wealth and nobility never leave one’s person, and emoluments extend to one’s descendants. The kingly Way of old was like this.\n\nLaozi said: The people have a Way they all follow and laws they all uphold. Yet righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler holds to the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Way is not for the purpose of action but for the purpose of non-action. The wise do not make virtue their affair; the brave do not use strength for violence; the benevolent do not use position for favor—this may be called holding to the One. The One is the Dao without preference, the root of the myriad things.\n\nWhen a ruler frequently changes the laws, and a state frequently changes its ruler, people use their positions to pursue their likes and dislikes. The tasks of subordinates become so numerous with fear that they cannot be managed. Thus, when a ruler loses the One, the resulting chaos is worse than having no ruler at all. Only when the ruler holds to the One can he unite the people.\n\nWenzi asked: How many are the kingly Ways?\nLaozi said: Only one.\nWenzi said: In ancient times, some kings ruled by the Dao, and some ruled by force. How can there be only one?\nLaozi said: To rule by the Dao is virtue; to rule by force is also virtue. There are five kinds of military force: righteous force, responsive force, force of anger, force of greed, and force of arrogance. To punish the violent and save the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use force, it is called responsive; to fight over trivial matters without restraining one’s heart is called anger; to covet others’ lands and desire their wealth is called greed; to rely on the size of one’s state, boast of the multitude of one’s people, and seek to be deemed worthy by enemy states is called arrogance. Righteous force brings kingship; responsive force brings victory; force of anger brings defeat; force of greed brings death; force of arrogance brings annihilation—this is the heavenly Dao.\n\nLaozi said: To abandon the Dao and rely on wisdom is perilous; to discard calculation and employ talent is to court trouble. Thus, to keep to one’s allotment and follow principle, one does not grieve over loss nor rejoice over gain. What is accomplished is not what one has done; what is obtained is not what one has sought. In receiving, there is acceptance but no taking; in giving, there is bestowal but no conferring. One follows spring to give life and autumn to bring death. Those who are given life do not feel gratitude; those who are put to death do not bear resentment—this is close to the Dao.\n\nWenzi asked: How can a ruler win the delight of the people?\nLaozi said: It is like the Yangtze and the sea: \"Bland and without flavor, yet inexhaustible in use,\" putting the small first and the great last. \"Those who wish to rise above others must humble their words; those who wish to precede others must put themselves behind.\" The world will surely emulate their delight and love, advancing their benevolence and righteousness without harshness. \"Dwelling above, the people do not find them burdensome; standing ahead, the multitude does not find them harmful. The world delights in exalting them without tiring.\" Even in distant lands and among different customs, from the smallest flying insects to the tiniest creeping things, none are not intimate. There is nowhere they do not reach, no place they do not succeed. \"Thus, they are honored by all under Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: To cling to the laws and records of one age and reject the customs of successive generations is like gluing the pegs of a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexibility, applying what is fitting according to the situation. When the age differs, affairs change; when the times shift, customs transform. One discusses the age to establish laws and acts according to the times.\n\nThe kings of high antiquity had differing systems of laws and measures, not because they sought to oppose the past, but because the demands of their times varied. Thus, they did not model themselves on established laws but on the principles by which laws are made, moving in accord with transformation. The laws of the sage may be observed, but the origins of those laws cannot be traced; his words may be heeded, but the sources of those words cannot be discerned.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, regarded the myriad things as insignificant, equated life and death, and harmonized with change. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the true nature of all things, befriending the Dao above and aligning with transformation below. If one today seeks to learn their Way yet fails to attain clarity and luminosity, even if a profound sage clings to their legal codes and enforces their decrees, governance will not succeed.\n\nWenzi asked about governance.\nLaozi said: Guide them with the Dao, nurture them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not impose force. Diminish and hold to the One. Let no profit be apparent, no desire be visible. Be square without cutting, be sharp without wounding. Be neither boastful nor self-aggrandizing. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will draw near; nurture them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not impose force, and the people will remain unspoiled.\n\nNot displaying worthiness is frugality; not imposing force is restraint. Lowering oneself to gather the people, using rewards to win them, practicing frugality to preserve oneself, and exercising restraint to avoid complacency. Without lowering oneself, the people scatter; without nurturing them, they turn away. Displaying worthiness incites competition; imposing force breeds resentment. Scattering weakens the state’s power; rebellion against the ruler erodes his authority. Competition leads to disregard for wrongdoing; resentment toward superiors endangers their position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Way is nearly achieved.\n\nLaozi said: The words of superiors are put into practice by inferiors; the words of inferiors are employed by superiors. The words of superiors are consistently applied; the words of inferiors are contingently used. Only the sage can comprehend the art of contingency. To speak and invariably keep one’s word, to set expectations and invariably meet them—these are the loftiest conduct under Heaven. Yet to testify against one’s father out of rectitude, or to die for a woman out of fidelity—who would esteem such acts? Thus, the sage evaluates the right and wrong of affairs, adapting with flexibility, without fixed standards. When circumstances favor it, he is hailed as a worthy ruler; when they do not, he is seized like a father in peril. Such is the force of circumstance.\n\nContingency is how the sage alone perceives. To first oppose and later align is called contingency; to first align and later oppose is to lack contingency. Those who lack contingency turn good into evil.\n\nWenzi asked: Master, your teachings hold that without the Dao and virtue, the world cannot be governed. Yet among the kings of former ages who inherited and continued their predecessors’ legacies, some were without the Dao, yet each passed their era without calamity or ruin. By what principle was this so?\n\nLaozi said: From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own lives, yet the quality of that sustenance varies in depth. The world at times sees states perish and families collapse—this arises from the absence of the Dao and virtue. Those who rise early and retire late, ever vigilant and trembling with caution, constantly fearing peril and ruin, may yet avoid disaster. But those who indulge their desires and grow indolent will perish without warning.\n\nHad Jie and Zhou followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even if Tang and Wu were worthy, they would have had no achievements to establish. The Dao and virtue are what sustain and nourish, what foster and nurture, what engender affection and love, what inspire reverence and esteem. Even the deaf and mute, though foolish, do not harm those they love. If all the people under Heaven harbored hearts of benevolence and love, how could misfortune and disaster arise?\n\nThose who lack the Dao yet avoid harm do so because benevolence has not been extinguished and righteousness has not been obliterated. Though benevolence is not extinguished and righteousness not obliterated, if the feudal lords grow disdainful of their superiors, the court will lack reverence. If they indulge their commands and act without deference, and if benevolence is extinguished and righteousness obliterated, the feudal lords will rebel. When the multitude seizes power, the strong oppress the weak, the great encroach upon the small, and the people take attack as their profession—then disasters arise, calamities erupt, and ruin is imminent. How could they expect to avoid misfortune?\n\nLaozi said: When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people resort to deceit. When superiors are meddlesome, inferiors adopt many guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To create affairs from affairs, and then to use affairs to halt affairs, is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate trouble with cleverness, and then to guard against it with cleverness, is like stirring water and hoping for clarity.\n\nLaozi said: If a ruler favors benevolence, the undeserving are rewarded and the guilty are pardoned. If he favors punishment, the meritorious are discarded and the innocent are harmed. But one who is free from likes and dislikes metes out punishment without resentment and bestows rewards without self-congratulation. Aligning with standards and following the plumb line, he remains uninvolved in affairs, like Heaven and Earth—what does he not cover and sustain? To harmonize and unite is the role of the ruler; to distinguish and punish is the role of the law. When the people accept punishment without resentment or bitterness, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said: Right and wrong under Heaven have no fixed standard. Each age approves what it deems good and condemns what it deems bad. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but what aligns with themselves; they do not reject what is perverse but what opposes their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and abide by it, and reject what is wrong and cast it aside, I would not know what the world calls right and wrong. Thus, \"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish\"—do not stir it.\n\nThose who rush to agreement find their words well-received and their bonds strengthened, yet if their persons are distant while their plans are sound, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await the world’s response, how would I know by what standards others measure me? To run alongside the俗 is like fleeing the rain—there is no place one does not get drenched. If one’s desire lies in emptiness, one cannot attain emptiness. But to not strive for emptiness and yet become empty—this is what one desires and nothing fails to arrive.\n\nThus, one who is attuned to the Dao is like the axle of a cart: it does not move itself yet, with the wheel, travels a thousand miles, turning endlessly. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao and returns to the ultimate, not transforming to await transformation, acting without contrivance.\n\nLaozi said: Those who frequently wage war and repeatedly triumph will see their state perish. Frequent warfare exhausts the people; repeated victories make the ruler arrogant. To employ an arrogant ruler to command an exhausted people—few states do not perish.\n\nThe ruler’s arrogance leads to indulgence; indulgence leads to the exhaustion of things. The people’s exhaustion breeds resentment; resentment breeds extreme anxiety. When both above and below reach extremes, yet the state does not perish—this has never been.\n\nThus, “To achieve success and then withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.” King Ping asked Wenzi: “I have heard that you attained the Dao from Lao Dan. Now, though a worthy may possess the Dao, if he encounters an age of licentious disorder, relying on the power of one man to transform a long-corrupted people—how could this be possible?” Wenzi replied: “The virtue and power of the Dao rectify decline to restore order, rouse chaos to bring governance, and transform excess and decay to return to simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world finds peace—all hinges on one man.\n\nThe ruler is the people’s teacher; the superior is the model for those below. What the superior esteems, those below emulate; when the superior embodies the Dao, those below cultivate benevolence and righteousness. With benevolence and righteousness below, there can be no age of licentious disorder.\n\nAccumulated virtue makes a king; accumulated resentment makes ruin. Piled stones form a mountain; gathered waters form a sea. Without accumulation, nothing comes to fruition—this has never been. One who accumulates virtue and power is granted the Mandate of Heaven, assisted by Earth, aided by spirits and gods. The phoenix alights in his courtyard; the qilin roams his outskirts; dragons dwell in his ponds.\n\nThus, to govern the world with the Dao is the world’s virtue; to rule the world without the Dao is the world’s bane. To set oneself against the world as an enemy—though one may wish for longevity, it cannot be attained. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle; Jie and Zhou perished by it.”\n\nKing Ping said: “I have received your instruction.” Volume Six.\n\nThe Power of Supreme Virtue\n\nLaozi said: The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is at peace, the hundred joints are all at rest; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred joints are all in chaos. Thus, when the body is well-governed, the limbs forget one another; when the state is well-governed, ruler and minister forget one another.\n\nLaozi studied under Chang Cong. Seeing his teacher’s tongue, he learned to embrace softness. Gazing up at the rafters and beams, he withdrew and observed the rivers, watching reflections to understand the value of holding back. Thus the sage says: “Do not cling to routine; always remain behind, never ahead.” It is like piling firewood—what is placed last ends up on top.\n\nLaozi said: The ringing bell destroys itself with its own sound; the tallow candle consumes itself with its own light. The tiger and leopard are hunted for their patterns; the swift gibbon and ape are trapped for their agility. Thus, the valiant and martial die by their strength; the eloquent and clever are ensnared by their wit.\n\nOne may use wisdom to know, but cannot use wisdom to be ignorant. Like one bold in a single skill or discerning in a single phrase—such a person may engage in subtle arguments, but cannot respond broadly. Laozi said: The Dao takes non-action as its form. Look for it and its shape cannot be seen; listen for it and its sound cannot be heard. This is called the “dark and obscure.”\n\nThe dark and obscure is how we discuss the Dao, but it is not the Dao itself. The Dao is found by looking inward and reflecting on oneself. Thus, one who does not indulge in petty learning does not fall into great delusion; one who does not settle for small cleverness does not become utterly foolish.\n\nDo not take flowing puddles as a mirror, but still water—preserving it so that it remains still and does not ripple outward. When the moon is full, the sun steals its light; yin cannot bear yang. When the sun rises, the stars are visible, yet they cannot contend with its brilliance. The branch cannot be stronger than the trunk; the twig cannot be larger than the bough. When the top is heavy and the bottom light, overturning is inevitable.\n\nA single abyss does not harbor two jiao dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. One brings stability; two bring strife. Jade lies in the mountains, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the shores do not wither. The earthworm has no strong sinews or sharp claws, yet it eats the soil above and drinks the yellow springs below—all because its mind is single.\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water can reveal the pupil of the eye. Turbidity brings harm: the waters of a river cannot reveal Mount Tai. The orchid and iris do not lose their fragrance because no one wears them; the boat does not sink in the Yangtze or the sea because no one rides it. The noble person practices the Dao not because no one knows of it and grows resentful—such is the nature of things.\n\nTo enter the turbid from the clear brings only distress and humiliation; to enter the clear from the turbid brings only ruin and collapse. When heaven’s two qi converge, a rainbow forms; when earth’s two qi converge, the hidden is released. When a person’s two qi converge, illness arises. Yin and yang cannot remain constant: the sun may be winter yet feel like summer; the moon may not know day; the sun may not know night.\n\nWhere rivers are wide, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall. Where the land is vast, virtue is profound. Thus, fish cannot be hooked without bait; beasts cannot be summoned with empty vessels. Where mountains harbor fierce beasts, the forest trees are not felled; where gardens harbor stinging insects, the mallows and beans are not plucked. Where a state has worthy ministers, they repel enemies a thousand li away.\n\nOne who is attuned to the Dao is like a wheel turning at its hub—not by one’s own effort, yet able to travel a thousand li, returning to the beginning, revolving endlessly at the source. Thus, to promote the crooked alongside the straight—how is this better than having none at all? To promote the straight alongside the crooked—do not proceed with such a course.\n\nWhen a bird is about to come, one sets out the net to await it. The bird is caught by a single mesh of the net. But if one makes a net of only a single mesh, there will never be a time to catch the bird. Thus, some affairs cannot be planned in advance; some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage nurtures the Dao and awaits the moment.\n\nIf one wishes to attract fish, first clear the valleys; if one wishes to draw birds, first plant trees. Water accumulates and fish gather; trees flourish and birds alight. To obtain fish, one does not carry them into the deep; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees—simply let them follow what benefits them.\n\nWhat the feet tread upon is shallow, yet one must rely on what they do not tread upon to walk. What the mind knows is limited, yet one must rely on what it does not know to attain clarity. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when river waters run deep, their source lies in the mountains.\n\nStill water is clear; clear water is level; level water is smooth; smooth water reveals the forms of things. Forms cannot overlap, and thus can serve as a standard. The falling of leaves is caused by the wind’s shaking; the muddying of water is caused by things stirring it. The carving of jade vessels is the work of the grindstone; the sharpness of the Moye blade is the power of the whetstone.\n\nTo harness a steed to travel a thousand li without flying, to have no provisions yet not hunger—when the cunning hare is caught, the hunting dog is cooked; when the high-flying bird is gone, the fine bow is put away. One who achieves fame and success retires—such is the Way of Heaven.\n\nAnger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. To look upon nothingness is to obtain true sight; to listen to silence is to obtain true hearing. Birds fly back to their native land; hares run to their burrows; foxes die with their heads toward the hills; cicadas cling to their native trees—each returns to where it was born.\n\nWater and fire are enemies, yet when a cauldron stands between them, the five flavors harmonize. Bones and flesh love one another, yet when slanderers intervene, father and son endanger each other. Dogs and pigs eat from any vessel and grow fat, hastening their death. The phoenix soars a thousand fathoms high—none can reach it.\n\nThe pestle can pound within a mortar yet cannot pound itself; the eye can see a hundred paces away yet cannot see its own lashes. Building a mountain upon high ground brings stability and no danger; digging a pond in low ground makes it deep, and fish and turtles gather there. Ditches overflow when flooded and dry up in drought, but the sources of rivers and seas are deep and never exhausted.\n\nThe turtle has no ears, yet its eyes cannot be obscured—so keen is its vision. The blind have no eyes, yet their ears cannot be deceived—so sharp is their hearing. Can muddy, swirling waters cleanse my feet? Can cool, clear waters wash my cap strings?\n\nSilk may become fine white silk—some is made into caps, some into shoes. The cap is worn on the head, while the shoe is trodden underfoot. Metal’s power overcomes wood, yet a single blade cannot fell a whole forest; earth’s power overcomes water, yet a handful cannot dam rivers and seas; water’s power overcomes fire, yet a single ladle cannot quench a cartload of kindling.\n\nIn winter there is thunder, in summer there is hail; cold and heat do not alter their seasons. Frost and snow glisten, yet at sunrise they melt and flow. What is tilted is easily overturned, what leans is easily toppled; a stool is easily moved, what is damp is easily rained upon. Orchids and angelica are fragrant, yet they cannot endure frost. When the toad smears its venom on weapons, their potency lasts until the full moon of the fifth month. Those who dissipate their essence are easily broken; blossoms that bloom out of season cannot be eaten.\n\nBetween the tongue and the teeth, which wears out first? Between the carpenter’s line and the arrow, which is straighter? What makes a shadow crooked is the form; what makes an echo muddy is the sound. One afflicted with the same illness as the dead is no good physician; one who follows the same path as a ruined state cannot offer loyal counsel.\n\nLet a musician blow the *yu*, let a craftsman cover the finger-holes—though the notes be in tune, they cannot be used to make decisions, for the ruler’s form is absent. The deaf do not sing, for they cannot delight themselves; the blind do not gaze, for they cannot engage with things.\n\nOne who walks through a forest cannot take the straight path; one who travels through peril cannot tread a tightrope. What the land produces determines its greatness. The sun does not rise twice, the fox does not have two males, the divine dragon does not pair, fierce beasts do not herd, birds of prey do not mate—just as a roof beam cannot block the sun, nor a wheel’s hub match the speed of its spokes, yet neither beam nor hub is sufficient on its own.\n\nA bow may shoot, but without the string it cannot loose; the loosing of the arrow is but one-tenth of the shot. A hungry horse in the stable lies silent, but when fodder is cast beside it, the urge to compete arises.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot be filled, even by all under heaven; but with a ten-*dan* vessel that has a stopper, a hundred bamboo stalks suffice. Cutting along a line does not exceed the mark; weighing with a balance does not err. Following ancient models by category may sometimes succeed, but if one wields the staff and cangue at will, or acts by whim, it is called chaos.\n\nThe farmer toils while the gentleman is nourished; the fool speaks while the wise choose. What is seen clearly is handled like jade and stone; what is seen dimly must be pondered. The brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows thrown open do not match the light of one door.\n\nThe viper cannot be given feet, nor the tiger wings. Now, a six-foot span: lying down, even the mediocre can cross it; standing upright, even the talented find it difficult—such is the difference in circumstances.\n\nThose who assist at sacrifices may taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights may be wounded. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites a thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon wish to shine, but murky clouds cover them; the river wishes to run clear, but sand and soil defile it; the lush orchid wishes to flourish, but autumn winds ruin it; human nature wishes to be balanced, but desires harm it. Covered in dust, one cannot avoid getting grit in the eye—purity is unattainable.\n\nA golden tortoise-knob sash is worn by the worthy as an ornament; soil spread upon the earth makes the capable rich. Thus, giving gold and jade to the weak is not as good as giving them a foot of plain silk.\n\nA wheel’s hub is hollow, standing at the center of thirty spokes—each does its part. If one spoke alone were forced in, the rest would all be abandoned; how then could near and far be reached?\n\nOranges and pomelos have their regions, reeds and rushes have their thickets. Beasts with the same feet flock together; birds with the same wings soar together.\n\nTo survey the lands of the Nine Provinces without traveling a thousand *li*, or to rule over the myriad people without the foundation of governance and teaching—this is difficult indeed!\n\nThe fierce are hunted, the haughty are shot. Thus, great whiteness appears tarnished, and abundant virtue seems insufficient.\n\nWhen the gentleman has wine, the petty man beats the jar—though it cannot be called fine, it need not be called shameful. Human nature finds silk and hemp comfortable; yet when arrows fly, one dons armor—what is inconvenient is done for the sake of convenience.\n\nThirty spokes share a single hub, each aligned with its own mortise, none able to intrude upon another—just as ministers each guard their own duties.\n\nOne who uses others well is like the feet of a tripod: many yet not in conflict, or like the tongue and teeth: hard and soft grinding without harming each other.\n\nStone is born hard, angelica is born fragrant; what is possessed in youth grows ever clearer with age.\n\nSupporting and lifting, declining and yielding, gaining and losing, assenting and refusing—these differ by a thousand *li*. What is reborn does not bear fruit; blossoms that bloom too early wither without waiting for frost.\n\nIf one dirties one’s level, powders one’s forehead, places a rotting rat on the threshold, and burns it in the hall—entering water only to get wet, or seeking fragrance while carrying stench—even the skilled cannot be called craftsmen.\n\nWinter ice can be broken, summer wood can be knotted; time is hard to gain and easy to lose.\n\nWhen a tree is in full leaf, plucking it all day only makes it grow back; but when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night.\n\nA target is set up, and arrows gather; a forest grows thick, and axes enter—not because they are summoned, but because the circumstances compel it.\n\nA nursing pup may bite a tiger; a brooding hen may strike a fox—where affection is applied, strength is not measured.\n\nThose who wait for profit before rescuing the drowning will themselves be drowned; a boat can float or sink, but the fool does not know when to stop.\n\nA fine steed may not advance when driven, nor stop when pulled—yet a ruler does not measure the Way by *li*.\n\nThough water is level, it must have waves; though a balance is true, it must have discrepancies; though a ruler is straight, it must have flaws. Without compass and square, circles and squares cannot be set; without level and line, curves and straightness cannot be corrected. Yet even those who use compass and square must have the mind of compass and square.\n\nThe height of Mount Tai, doubled, cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair can be examined. Bamboo and wood contain fire, but without drilling, no smoke arises; earth contains water, but without digging, none emerges.\n\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*; yet half-steps unceasingly taken carry the lame turtle a thousand *li*. Piling earth without cease forms hills and mountains.\n\nStanding by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning home to weave a net.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength; a horse must first be docile before seeking excellence; a person must first be trustworthy before seeking ability.\n\nA skilled smelter cannot melt wood; a master craftsman cannot carve ice—there are things that cannot be done, so why does the noble person not take heed?\n\nOne may prevent people from crossing the river, but one cannot prevent the river from having waves.\n\nWithout the moon’s fault, the steamer will never fall into the well.\n\nThose who criticize my conduct seek my friendship; those who disparage my goods seek my trade. Playing a single move in chess is not enough to reveal understanding; plucking a single string is not enough to express sorrow.\n\nNow if a single burning coal is picked up, it chars the hand; when placed near others, ten thousand bushels are all scorched. Yet at ten paces away, it brings death—same qi, different accumulation.\n\nWhere there is glory, there must be sorrow; where there is fine silk above, there must be coarse hemp below. The larger the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base.\n\nLaozi said: A drum does not store sound, yet it can produce sound; a mirror does not conceal form, yet it can reflect form. Metal and stone have voices, but without movement, they do not ring; pipes and flutes have tones, but without blowing, there is no sound.\n\nThus the sage conceals within and does not initiate for things. When affairs come, they are managed; when things arrive, they are responded to.\n\nThe heavens move without cease, ending and then beginning again—thus they endure long. A wheel returns to where it turns—thus it travels far. The heavens’ movement never errs—thus there is no fault.\n\nHeaven’s qi descends; earth’s qi ascends. Yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are as one. When the noble person acts, the petty person vanishes—this is the Way of heaven and earth.\n\nIf heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang do not communicate, and the myriad things do not flourish. When petty persons gain power and noble persons vanish, the five grains are not planted, and virtue and power are concealed within.\n\nThe Way of heaven reduces the full and augments the deficient; the Way of earth reduces the high and augments the low. The Way of ghosts and spirits humbles the arrogant and aids the lowly; the Way of humans does not aid the many. The Way of the sage is lowly, and none can surpass it.\n\nWhen the heavens are bright and clear, they can then illuminate the four directions. When the ruler is enlightened and the ministers are enlightened, the realm is at peace. With these four enlightened, one can endure long. To enlighten what is already enlightened is to enlighten its transformation.\n\nThe Way of heaven is measure; the Way of earth is principle. Harmony is made of unity, and time is its agent—thus the myriad things are completed. This is called the Way.\n\nThe great Way is level and broad, not far from the self. Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in things, and its virtue does not cease.\n\nHeaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nourish them. It gives but does not take—thus spirit returns to it. To give without taking is the highest virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.\n\nNothing is higher than heaven; nothing is lower than the marsh. Heaven is high and the marsh is low—thus the sage models them. With hierarchy and order, the world is settled.\n\nEarth bears the myriad things and makes them grow. It gives and takes—thus bones and skeletons return to it. To give and take is lesser virtue. “Lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it has no virtue.”\n\nEarth supports heaven, thus it is stable and peaceful. When earth is stable and peaceful, the myriad things take form. Earth is vast and thick—thus the myriad things gather. Stable and peaceful, it bears all; vast and thick, it contains all. Earth’s terrain is deep and thick—thus water springs gather within. Earth’s Way is square and broad—thus it endures long. The sage models this, and virtue contains all.\n\nWhen yin yields to yang, the myriad things flourish; when yang submits to yin, the myriad things are still. When things flourish, none are lacking; when things are still, none are unhappy. When things are happy, none are ungoverned.\n\nYin harms things; yang humbles itself. When yin advances and yang retreats, petty persons gain power, and noble persons avoid harm—this is the Way of heaven.\n\nWhen yang qi moves, the myriad things relax and find their place. Thus the sage follows the yang Way. One who follows things is followed by things; one who opposes things is opposed by things—thus one does not lose the nature of things.\n\nWhen wetlands are full, the myriad things mature in season; when wetlands dry up, the myriad things lack nurture. Thus when rain and moisture do not flow, the world becomes barren.\n\nYang rises and then returns below—thus it is the master of the myriad things. It does not long possess, thus it can end and begin again. Ending and beginning again, it can endure long. Able to endure long, it is the mother of the world.\n\nYang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who could transform without accumulation—thus the sage is cautious about what is accumulated.\n\nWhen yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow fat; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Thus when kings and lords esteem the yang Way, the myriad things flourish; when they esteem the yin Way, the world perishes.\n\nIf yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not form; if the ruler does not descend to the ministers, virtue and transformation do not spread. Thus when the ruler descends to the ministers, there is clarity; when the ruler does not descend, there is darkness and deafness.\n\nWhen the sun emerges from the earth, the myriad things multiply; when kings and lords stand above the people, they illuminate virtue and power. When the sun enters the earth, the myriad things rest; when petty persons stand above the people, the myriad things flee and hide.\n\nWhen thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The actions of great persons resemble this. The movement of yin and yang has constant rhythm; the actions of great persons do not exhaust things.\n\nWhen thunder shakes the earth, the myriad things relax; when wind sways the trees, grasses and trees wither. When great persons remove evil and pursue good, the people do not wander far. Thus the people have departures and arrivals—departures are not extreme, and arrivals are ever more numerous.\n\nWhen wind does not move, fire does not arise; when great persons do not speak, petty persons have nothing to recount. Fire’s arising must await kindling; the words of great persons must have trust. With trust and truth, what cannot be accomplished?\n\nWhen river waters are deep, soil is in the mountains; when hills and mounds are high, they descend into the abyss. When yang qi is abundant, it transforms into yin; when yin qi is abundant, it transforms into yang. Thus desire cannot be full; joy cannot be extreme.\n\n「Resentment without evil speech, anger without displaying color—this is called *calculating* well.\n\nFire rises upward in flames, water flows downward in currents; the **Dao** of the **Sage** is to seek like with like.\n\nWhen the **Sage** leans toward yang, the world unifies in harmony; when toward yin, the world drowns in chaos.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Accumulate thinness to form thickness, accumulate lowliness to form height. The noble person strives diligently to achieve brilliance, while the petty person hastens recklessly to invite disgrace. Though their waxing and waning may not be visible, thus they see goodness as if it were not yet attained, and past evils as if they were ill-omened.*\n\nIf one turns toward good, even if they err, there will be no blame. If one does not turn toward good, though they come with loyalty, they will bring evil. Hence, blaming others is not as good as blaming oneself. Exerting oneself for others is not as effective as exerting oneself for oneself.\n\nSound is summoned by oneself, kindred is sought by oneself, name is given by oneself, fate is shaped by oneself. Those without self-blame wield sharp words to pierce, and sharp blades to strike—why blame others? Thus, the noble person is cautious of trifles.\n\nAll things bear yin while embracing yang, and their clashing qi produces harmony. Harmony resides at the center—this is why grain grows in the heart, grass in the scrotum, and the fetus in the womb. Without yin, there is no gestation; without yang, there is no conception. Things must take time to grow.\n\nWhen the earth is level, water does not flow; when weights are balanced, the scale does not tip. The generation and transformation of things require stimulus to manifest.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Mountains reach their height, and clouds and rains arise from them; waters reach their depth, and dragons and serpents are born within them. The noble person fulfills their **Dao**, and virtue/power flows as beneficence.\"*\n\nThose who possess hidden virtue/power will surely receive open reward; those who act in concealment will surely gain manifest fame. Planting millet will not yield barley, and planting resentment will not yield gratitude. Thus, the seventh chapter: *Trifles and Clarity*.」\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Dao can be weak yet strong,\ngently yielding yet firm,\nyin yet yang,\nobscure yet luminous,\nenfolding heaven and earth,\nresponding without fixed measure.\nShallow knowledge knows not its depth,\nexternal knowledge knows not its inner essence,\ncoarse knowledge knows not its subtlety—\nto know is to not-know,\nto not-know is to know.\nWho can fathom the knowing of not-knowing,\nthe not-knowing of knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—heard, it is not.\nThe Dao cannot be seen—seen, it is not.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken—spoken, it is not.\nWho can grasp the formless form?\n\nThus:\n*\"When all under heaven know goodness as goodness,\nevil arises.\"*\n\nThe wise do not speak;\nthose who speak are not wise.*\n\nWenzi asked: *\"Can one act through subtle words?\"*\nLaozi replied: *\"Why not?*\n*You mean the speaking of knowing?*\n*He who speaks of knowing does not speak with words.*\n\n*Those who chase fish grow wet,\nthose who pursue beasts grow weary—\nnot because they take pleasure in it.\nThus, the ultimate speech transcends speech,\nthe ultimate action transcends action.\nThe shallow-minded contend over trifles.\n‘Words have their master,\ndeeds have their lord,\nto act without knowing—\nthus, they do not know me.’\"*\n\nWenzi asked: *\"Does governing a state also have its law?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Now, those who pull the cart—when the leader calls ‘hey!’ at the front, those behind respond in kind. This is the song of the cart-pullers, urging them to exert their strength. Even the music of Zheng and Wei, or the Hu and Chu, cannot match its purpose.*\n\n*To govern a state lies in ritual, not in eloquence. ‘When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits multiply.’*\n\n*The Dao has no fixed form yet can be made the standard; like mountains and forests, it can be made into timber. Timber cannot encompass mountains and forests, mountains and forests cannot encompass clouds and rain, clouds and rain cannot encompass yin and yang, yin and yang cannot encompass harmony, and harmony cannot encompass the Dao. The Dao is ‘that which has no form yet is the form of all things, no image yet is the image of all things.’ Without comprehending its intent, all between heaven and earth can be shaped and transformed.*\n\n*The Sage establishes teachings and governs, ever mindful of their beginning and end, seeing how blessings are bestowed. Thus, when people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know mechanisms, substance declines. A zither need not be struck for its twenty-five strings to each sound in response; a wheel need not be turned by itself for its thirty spokes to each exert their force in rotation. Strings must have tension and slackness to form melody; wheels must have labor and rest to travel far. What makes sound is itself without sound; what makes turning is itself without turning.*\n\n*When superiors and inferiors follow different Ways, ease in governance leads to chaos. Those in high station with great Way follow fortune; those in great affairs with small Way meet ruin. Minor virtue harms righteousness, minor goodness harms the Way, minor eloquence harms governance, and harshness injures virtue. The most upright is not rigid, so the people are easily guided. In perfect governance, ease prevails, so the lower ranks do not rebel. In supreme loyalty, simplicity returns, so the people harbor no deceit or concealment.*\n\n*The Master said: When laws of mutual punishment are established, the people resent them; when decrees to reduce titles are issued, loyal ministers rebel. Thus, those who scrutinize legal records do not know the roots of order and chaos, and those skilled in military formations do not grasp the strategies of temple warfare. The Sage first secures blessings within the pass, and considers calamities beyond the unseen. The foolish are dazzled by small gains and forget great harm, so there are actions beneficial in the short term but ruinous in the long, gains here but losses there. Thus, no love is greater than loving others, no wisdom greater than knowing others. Loving others means no resentment of punishment; knowing others means no chaos in governance.*\n\n*The Master said: Though the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers are vast, their floods subside within three days. Violent winds and torrential rains cease within moments. He who accumulates no virtue yet fears no want is doomed to meet it. Worry is the path to flourishing; delight is the path to ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, transform misfortune into blessing. The Dao is empty yet never full.*\n\n*The Master said: Serenity and tranquility are human nature; propriety and measure are the rules of conduct. Knowing human nature, one nurtures oneself without contradiction; knowing the rules of conduct, one acts without disorder. A single command disperses without rivalry; a unified principle governs all—this is called *heart*. To see the root and know the branches, to grasp one and respond to ten thousand—this is called *technique*. To act knowing one’s purpose, to move knowing one’s destination, to undertake knowing one’s means, to stop knowing one’s limit—this is called the *Way*.*\n\n*To make others exalt and praise you is the power of the heart; to make others belittle and slander you is the fault of the heart. Words once spoken cannot be recalled by others; deeds once begun cannot be restrained from afar. Affairs are difficult to complete but easy to ruin; reputation is difficult to establish but easy to lose. All people neglect minor harms and trifling matters until they become calamities. Calamity arises from within; blessing is self-made. Calamity and blessing share a gate; profit and harm are neighbors. Without the utmost discernment, none can distinguish them. Thus, wise deliberation is the threshold of calamity and blessing; action and stillness are the pivot of profit and harm—one must not fail to examine them carefully.*\n\n*The Master said: All know the mechanisms of order and chaos, yet none know how to preserve life entirely. Thus, the Sage assesses the times and acts accordingly, weighs circumstances and plans accordingly. The Sage can be yin or yang, soft or hard, weak or strong, adapting to the times in motion and stillness, leveraging resources to achieve deeds. Seeing things as they go, one knows their return; observing one thing, one perceives its variations. When transformed, it takes form; when in motion, it responds. Thus, throughout life, one acts without constraint.*\n\n*There are things that can be spoken but not done, things that can be done but not spoken, things easy to begin but hard to complete, things hard to complete but easy to ruin. What can be done but not spoken is *taking and discarding*; what can be spoken but not done is *deceit and falsehood*; what is easy to begin but hard to complete is *affairs*; what is hard to complete but easy to ruin is *reputation*. These four are what the Sage attends to, what the enlightened alone perceive.*\n\n*The Master said: The Way is to revere the subtle, act without transgression, and guard against a hundred dangers with repeated warnings. Then calamity will not fester. In calculating blessings, do not overreach; in considering calamity, exceed it. Like the sun and moon in the sky, those obscured are not harmed. The foolish, with preparation, match the wise in achievement.*\n\n*Accumulated love brings blessing; accumulated hatred brings calamity. All know how to avert disaster, yet none know how to prevent it from arising. Preventing disaster from arising is easy; remedying it is difficult. Now people do not strive to prevent disaster but only to remedy it—even the divine cannot devise such strategies. The origins of calamity are countless and boundless. The Sage retreats in seclusion to avoid disaster, remains silent and waits for the time. The petty, unaware of the gates of calamity and blessing, act and fall into punishment. Though they contrive every precaution, it is insufficient to shield their bodies.*\n\n*Thus, the superior person first avoids calamity and then seeks gain, first shuns disgrace and then pursues reputation. The Sage always attends to what is formless, not lingering on what is already manifest. Therefore, calamity and blame have no path to reach him; praise cannot soil him.\"*\n\nLaozi said: **\"The Way of the common person**—let the heart be small, the will great, the wisdom comprehensive, the conduct upright, the capabilities many, and the undertakings few.\n\nWhat is meant by *‘let the heart be small’*? To anticipate misfortune before it arises, to guard against calamity in its subtlest forms, and to never dare indulge desire.\n\n*‘Let the will be great’*—to encompass all under heaven, to harmonize disparate customs, to gather all judgments toward a central truth.\n\n*‘Wisdom comprehensive’*—to have no beginning or end, to flow in all directions like the four seas, to be a boundless spring that never runs dry.\n\n*‘Conduct upright’*—to stand firm and unyielding, to remain pure and unstained, to remain steadfast in adversity and not to boast in prosperity.\n\n*‘Capabilities many’*—to possess both literary and martial arts, to move and rest in perfect measure, to act and rest in accordance with what is fitting.\n\n*‘Undertakings few’*—to grasp the essential and pair it with the multitude, to hold fast to simplicity and govern the broad, to remain still and steady the restless.\n\nThus, the one whose heart is small **restrains at the outset**; the one whose will is great **embraces all**; the one whose wisdom is comprehensive **knows all**; the one whose conduct is upright **has nothing to do**; the one whose capabilities are many **governs all**; the one whose undertakings are few **holds fast to the essential**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, when it comes to virtue, does nothing small that he does not practice; when it comes to fault, he does not overlook even the slightest. His actions do not rely on shamans or sorcerers, yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before him—this is true nobility. Yet he trembles and fears daily, ever cautious, and thus achieves unity through non-action.\n\nThe fool’s wisdom is already scant, yet the deeds he undertakes are many—thus, every move he makes leads to exhaustion. Therefore, to govern with proper teaching is easy and certain to succeed; to govern with perverse teaching is difficult and certain to fail. To abandon what is easy and certain to succeed, and instead engage in what is difficult and certain to fail—this is the folly of delusion.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Blessing arises softly and steadily, while calamity bursts forth in chaos. The patterns of blessing and calamity are subtle and unseen, yet the Sage perceives their beginning and end—thus, they must be observed.**\n\nThe wise ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself, but for the state. What benefits himself but not the state shall not be rewarded; what harms himself but benefits the state shall not be punished.\n\nThus, to uphold what is fitting is called a *junzi*; to abandon what is fitting is called a petty person.\n\nTo grasp intelligence without labor is best; next is to labor without illness; worst is to be ill without labor. The ancients savored without abandoning; the present age abandons without savoring.\n\nZhou’s *xiàngliè* (ritual wine vessel) caused Ji Zi to sigh, and the Ru’s burial of a dummy figure made Confucius lament—seeing their beginnings, one knows their ends.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Ren is what people admire, and *yì* is what people revere. To be admired and revered, yet sometimes meet with death and the ruin of one’s state—this is failing to align with the times. Thus, one who knows *yì* but not the power of the age does not grasp the Dao.\n\nThe Five Emperors valued *de*, the Three Kings relied on *yì*, the Five Hegemons depended on force. To take the Dao of the emperors and apply it in the age of the hegemons is not the proper way.\n\nThus, good and evil, praise and blame, popularity and unpopularity, all follow the same paths of right and wrong, left and right.\n\nTo know the workings of Heaven and the actions of humanity is to have the means to govern the world.\n\nTo know Heaven but not humanity is to lack the means to interact with the world; to know humanity but not Heaven is to lack the means to align with the Dao.\n\nTo follow one’s will and gratify one’s desires is to be enslaved by the strong; to make one’s body serve others is to be consumed by yin and yang.\n\nThe one who attains the Dao transforms outwardly but not inwardly. Outward transformation is how one knows humanity; inward non-transformation is how one preserves oneself. Thus, inwardly, one maintains a fixed principle, while outwardly, one bends and extends, moving with things. In all actions, one does not fall—what is precious in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation.\n\nTo uphold one principle and extend one action, even if fully realized, is still not easy. To cling to minor virtues while blocking the Great Dao—\n\nThe Dao is silent and empty, non-doing toward things, non-attachment to oneself. Thus, to act in accordance with the Dao is not the doing of one who does not know the Dao, but the Dao’s own unfolding.\n\nWhat Heaven and Earth cover and load, what the sun and moon illuminate, what yin and yang nourish, what rain and dew moisten, what *de* sustains—all are in harmony as one word.\n\nThus, the one who wears the great roundness walks the great square, the one who mirrors great clarity sees great brightness, the one who stands in great peace dwells in the great hall. The one who wanders in the murky depths shines with the sun and moon, manifesting the formless within the formed. Therefore, the True Person rests his hopes on the *língtái* (spiritual platform) and returns to the origin of things, gazing into the murky depths, listening to the soundless—within the murky depths, there is alone clarity; within the silent void, there is alone illumination.\n\nIts use is in non-use; only in non-use can one truly use it. Its knowing is in non-knowing; only in non-knowing can one truly know it.\n\nThe Dao is the path of all things; *de* is the support of life; *rén* is the proof of accumulated kindness; *yì* is what aligns with the heart and suits the multitude.\n\nWhen the Dao fades, *de* flourishes; in the middle age, *de* is upheld but not cherished; in the later age, *rén* is stringently enforced, as if fearing its loss.\n\nThus, the *junzi* has no means to live without *yì*; to lose *yì* is to lose the means to live. The petty person has no means to live without profit; to lose profit is to lose the means to live. Thus, the *junzi* fears losing *yì*, the petty person fears losing profit—observe what they fear, and their blessings and calamities differ.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Sometimes, to seek profit harms; harming is what truly profits. To feed a feverish patient with rich food, to give cold water to a thirsty one—this is how the common crowd nurtures illness, while the skilled physician does the opposite.\n\nWhat pleases the eyes, what pleases the heart—this is what the foolish Dao profits from, yet what the one who knows the Dao avoids.\"**\n\nThe Sage first diverges and then harmonizes; the common crowd first harmonizes and then diverges. Therefore, the gates of calamity and blessing, the reversal of benefit and harm, cannot be overlooked.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Those with merit who abandon virtue and righteousness will be met with suspicion; those with guilt who uphold virtue and righteousness will be trusted. Thus, virtue and righteousness are the constant path of proper conduct, the esteemed rank of the world. Though plans and strategies may be sound, if actions stray from virtue and righteousness, their merit will not be fulfilled. Though words may lack precision in policy, if their intent is loyal and their counsel benefits the state, yet their heart is devoted to the ruler and aligned with virtue and righteousness, their life will be preserved. Therefore, it is said: 'Even if one’s words and plans are always wrong, it is better to abandon them and carefully uphold virtue and righteousness.'\n\nLaozi said: 'Teaching originates from the *junzi*; the petty person benefits from its influence. Profit originates from the petty person; the *junzi* enjoys its merit. If the *junzi* and petty person each find their proper place, then governance becomes effortless and the Dao is realized. People who desire much will harm virtue; those who worry much will impair wisdom. Therefore, in governing a state—what brings joy ensures survival, what brings sorrow leads to ruin.\n\nWater flows downward, vast and expansive; the ruler submits to ministers, wise and discerning. If the ruler does not contend with ministers, the Way of governance flows smoothly. Thus, the ruler is the root and foundation, the ministers are branches and leaves. If the root is not flourishing yet the branches are lush, such a thing has never existed.\n\nLaozi said: 'The loving kindness of a benevolent father toward his child is not sought for its return; it cannot be resolved within the heart. The nurturing of a wise sovereign toward the people is not for the sake of scholars; it is the nature of things, inevitable. But if one relies on their strength and exploits their merits, they will inevitably reach ruin, and those who depend on them will find their favor does not extend.\n\nThus, if one employs what the common people love, they will gain the common people’s strength; if one raises what the common people delight in, they will win the common people’s hearts. Therefore, observe their beginning, and you will know their end.\n\nLaozi said: 'People are bound by virtue; factions are strengthened by cliques. Thus, if the scope of what is granted is broad, the influence of what is enforced will be far-reaching. If virtue is applied thinly, the force of what is restrained will be small.\n\nLaozi said: 'If one gains through unrighteousness and does not distribute it, misfortune will befall them. They cannot benefit others, nor themselves—this can be called a foolish person, no different from the owl that loves its young. Therefore, it is said: *\"Clutching and hoarding cannot compare to letting go; probing and scheming cannot endure long.\"* Virtue and the Dao are intertwined; the Dao and virtue are inseparable. Their transformations are boundless. Within the bright is the dark; within the dark is the bright. All things follow this pattern, beyond measure.\n\nBlessings come with auspicious signs; calamities precede with omens. If one sees auspicious signs yet does not act virtuously, blessings will not arrive. If one sees inauspicious signs yet acts virtuously, calamities will not befall. Benefit and harm share the same threshold; calamity and blessing are neighbors. Only the divine and the Sage can distinguish them. Therefore, it is said: *\"Calamity, oh calamity, is the foundation of blessing; blessing, oh blessing, is the seed of calamity—who can know their limits?\"*\n\nWhen people are about to fall ill, they first crave the taste of fish and meat. When a state is about to fall, it first despises the words of loyal ministers. Thus, the dying cannot be healed by a skilled physician, nor can a doomed state be saved by loyal counsel.\n\nCultivate oneself first, then one can govern the people. Manage one’s household properly, then one can be entrusted with official duties. Therefore, it is said: *\"Cultivate oneself, and one’s virtue becomes genuine; cultivate one’s household, and one’s virtue has surplus; cultivate one’s state, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.\"*\n\nThe people’s means of survival are clothing and food. If matters concerning clothing and food are well attended, there will be merit; if neglected, there will be none. Matters without merit cannot endure long.\n\nThus, if one follows the times yet does not succeed, do not alter the laws. If one conforms to the times yet does not succeed, do not change the principles. When the times shift again, this is called the rhythm of the Dao.\n\nThe Emperor enriches his people; the King enriches his land. A ruler in peril enriches his officials; a well-governed state seems lacking in wealth. A ruined state has empty granaries. Therefore, it is said: *\"When the ruler has no affairs, the people naturally prosper; when the ruler does nothing, the people naturally transform.\"*\n\nRaising an army of ten thousand men, daily expenditures of a thousand gold—*\"After the campaign’s return, there will surely be a year of misfortune.\"* Thus, it is said: *\"Warfare is an inauspicious instrument; it is not the treasure of the *junzi*.\"* *\"Conciliating great grudges will surely leave lingering grudges,\"*—how can this be considered good?\n\nIn ancient times, those who were close were not treated differently by speech; those who were distant were not treated differently by speech. The near were made to delight, the distant were made to come.\n\nIf one shares the people’s desires, harmony will follow; if one shares the people’s safeguards, stability will follow; if one shares the people’s thoughts, wisdom will follow. Those who gain the people’s strength will be rich; those who gain the people’s praise will be honored. Actions invite enemies; words bring calamity. Do not speak before others; speak after others have spoken.\n\nWhispered words may spread a thousand miles. The speaker invites calamity; the tongue is a mechanism. If words are spoken inappropriately, not even four horses can outrun their consequences.\n\nOnce, Zhonghuangzi said: *\"Heaven has five directions, Earth has five phases, sound has five tones, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and people have five stations. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, there are twenty-five kinds of people.\n\nThe highest five are the divine person, the true person, the Dao person, the perfect person, and the Sage. The next five are the virtuous person, the worthy person, the wise person, the good person, and the eloquent person. The middle five are the upright person, the loyal person, the trustworthy person, the righteous person, and the ceremonious person. The next five are the scholar, the artisan, the hunter, the farmer, and the merchant. The lowest five are the common person, the slave, the foolish person, the brute, and the petty person. The highest five and the lowest five differ as much as people differ from cattle and horses.\n\nThe Sage observes with the eyes, listens with the ears, speaks with the mouth, and acts with the feet.\n\nThe True person does not observe yet is clear, does not listen yet is discerning, does not act yet is followed, does not speak yet is upright.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage moves the world through his virtue, yet the True Person has never surpassed him. The worthy person corrects the common customs, yet the Sage has never observed them.\n\nThe so-called **Dao/Way** is without before or after, without left or right. All things merge in mysterious unity, neither affirming nor denying.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Naturalness**\nLaozi says: **\"Qīngxū** [purity and emptiness] is the clarity of Heaven, **wúwéi** [non-action] is the constant of governance. To abandon favor and wisdom, discard the virtues of the worthy and the cunning of the Sage, forsake skillful talents, reject benevolence and righteousness, extinguish old customs, abandon artful persuasion, and suppress deceit—then the worthy and the unworthy alike will align with the Dao.\n\n**Stillness brings unity; emptiness brings harmony.** The ultimate **virtue/power** is **non-action**, yet all things find their place. The Dao of **emptiness and stillness** endures as vast as Heaven and enduring as Earth, its subtlety infinite and overflowing, yet it does not dominate any thing.\n\nThe twelve months move in cycles, returning without end. **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth**—their forces oppose yet their **Dao/Way** complements each other. So extreme cold harms things, yet without cold, it would be impossible. Extreme heat harms things, yet without heat, it would be impossible. Thus, what is possible and what is impossible both arise from possibility, hence the great **Dao/Way** has no absolute impossibility. It lies in its **lǐ** [principle/reason], seeing what is possible yet not rushing toward it, seeing what is impossible yet not avoiding it. What is possible and what is impossible are like the left and right, the exterior and interior of each other.\n\nThe essence of all things must begin with **one**; time serves as its measure. From ancient times to the present, it has never altered or changed—this is called **Heavenly lǐ**. Above, it holds the great clarity; below, it utilizes its radiance. The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things, its **lǐ** rests in **Yīnyáng** [yin-yang], its transformation becomes the four seasons, its division the five phases. Each finds its place, moving with the times, yet its laws remain constant. Even the lowliest of beings conforms, while the **Dao/Way** itself remains uninclined. When all ministers are of one mind, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth is **non-action** yet complete, **non-seeking** yet fulfilled. *\"Hence one knows its benefit lies in non-action.\"*\n\nLaozi says: **\"Pǔ** [uncarved simplicity], the greatest of all, has no form; the **Dao/Way**, the greatest of all, has no measure. Thus, Heaven’s compass is not bound by the circle, Earth’s square is not confined by the rule. The past and present are called **zhòu** [duration], the four directions and above and below are called **yǔ** [space]. The **Dao/Way** dwells in the midst yet is unknown in its location. Thus, those who see not far cannot be spoken to of the great, those who know not broadly cannot be instructed on the ultimate.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** that communicates with all things cannot be contradicted. Hence the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, though their laws and systems varied by region, all won the hearts of the people in the same way.\n\nIf one speaks of **rulers and measures, hooks and cords**—these are tools of craft, yet not the essence of craft. Thus, even with a master, a stringless instrument cannot produce its melody, and a lone string cannot weep alone. The string is but the tool for weeping, not the weeping itself.\n\nWhen **shén** [spirit] and **hé** [harmony] are achieved, they play between the heart and hands. To let the mind wander freely and express the **spirit** through the strings, to discuss love yet reveal it in the music—this is a **Dao/Way** that cannot be taught. A father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the **Dao/Way** that does not transmit.\n\nThus, **sù** [solemnity] is the sovereign of form, while **jìmiào** [silence and solitude] is the master of sound.\n\nLaozi says: The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth is rooted in **virtue/power**, the **Dao/Way** itself is its command, and all things regulate themselves.\n\nThe most subtle and profound does not serve the noble, hence it does not await merit to establish itself, nor does it rely on rank for its honor, nor does it seek reputation for its brilliance, nor does it need ceremony for its dignity, nor does it employ force for its strength. Thus, the **Dao/Way** stands yet does not instruct, its clarity shines yet does not scrutinize. The **Dao/Way** stands yet does not instruct, for it does not usurp others’ abilities; its clarity shines yet does not scrutinize, for it does not harm their undertakings.\n\nTo teach the **Dao/Way** is to go against **virtue/power**, to harm all things. Hence **Yīnyáng** and the four seasons, **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth**—though they share the same **Dao/Way**, their **lǐ** differs. All things share the same **qíng** [emotion], yet their forms vary.\n\nThe wise do not instruct each other, the skilled do not take from each other. Thus the Sage establishes laws to guide the hearts of the people, letting each follow their nature. Hence the living have no grievance, the dead no resentment.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as **chúdài** [sacrificial cattle]. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as **chúdài**. Benevolence, love, and righteousness are narrow **Dao/Way**s. The narrow cannot enter the great without confusion, the near cannot travel far without doubt. The **Dao/Way** of the Sage enters the great without confusion, travels far without doubt. He constantly guards himself in **emptiness**, and thus can attain the utmost—this is called **Heavenly virtue/power**.\n\nLaozi says: The Sage is covered by Heaven, borne by Earth, illuminated by the sun and moon. **Yīnyáng** harmonizes, the four seasons transform, yet he embraces all things without distinction. He neither clings to the old nor pursues the new, neither shuns the distant nor favors the near. Thus, those who can follow Heaven’s **Dao/Way** know that Heaven does not adhere to a single time, Earth does not limit itself to one material, and people do not pursue one path. Hence their undertakings are manifold, their actions diverse.\n\nThus, those who use arms may be **light or heavy**, **greedy or restrained**—these four are contrary, and cannot be unified. The **light** may be ordered to advance, yet they cannot be commanded to hold firm; the **heavy** may be ordered to defend, yet they cannot be commanded to assail. The **greedy** may be ordered to take, yet they cannot be commanded to distribute wealth; the **restrained** may be ordered to keep their share, yet they cannot be commanded to advance. The **trustworthy** may be ordered to keep their oaths, yet they cannot be commanded to adapt to change. These five, the Sage employs them all yet measures their use.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not cherish any single thing, **Yīnyáng** does not favor any single type. Thus the sea does not refuse the smallest streams to become great, the mountains and forests do not reject the crooked and bent to become lofty. The Sage does not reject the humble words of a woodcutter to broaden his name.\n\nTo guard one corner while abandoning the world, to take one thing while discarding the rest—then what is gained is few, and what is governed is shallow.\n\nLaozi says: What Heaven covers and Earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate—though their forms differ and their natures vary, each finds its own repose. Joy is the means of joy, yet it is also the means of sorrow. Safety is the means of safety, yet it is also the means of danger.\n\nThe Sage governs the people by allowing each to follow its nature, to dwell in comfort, to engage in what they are capable of, to fulfill their proper roles, and to act according to what is fitting. Thus all things harmonize, and none overstep their bounds.\n\nAll things under Heaven have neither nobility nor lowliness—what is valued is valued because of its worth, and all things are thus worthy; what is demeaned is demeaned because of its lack, and all things are thus unworthy. Therefore, the Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor does he cast fish upon trees or drown birds in the deep.\n\nIn ancient times, when Emperor Yao ruled the world, Shun was Minister of Instruction, Xiè was Minister of War, Yǔ was Minister of Works, Hòuxī was Overseer of Agriculture, Xī Zhòng was Master of Crafts. In guiding the people, those dwelling by water fished, those dwelling in forests gathered, those dwelling in valleys herded, and those dwelling on hills tilled. The land dictated their labor, their tools suited their tasks, and their tools were crafted from fitting materials. Marshes and wetlands were woven into nets, hillsides were plowed into fields. Thus, the people exchanged what they lacked for what they possessed, and what they were unskilled in for what they excelled at.\n\nHence, few deserted their homes, and many obeyed. Like wind passing through reeds, it stirred them effortlessly, and each responded according to purity or turbidity. All things naturally sought what benefited them and avoided what harmed them.\n\nThus neighboring states, though close enough to hear the sounds of roosters and dogs, never set foot upon one another’s borders, nor did their cart tracks meet beyond a thousand *lǐ*. All simply dwelled in peace.\n\nTherefore, chaotic states appear full, yet are empty; well-ordered states appear sparse, yet are abundant. States on the verge of ruin seem lacking, yet are preserved; thriving states seem excessive, yet endure. The \"empty\" is not without people—each fulfills their role. The \"full\" is not from excess—all are merely awaiting their turn. The \"abundant\" is not from wealth—it is from moderating desires and reducing expenditures. The \"lacking\" is not from scarcity—it is from few people and many costs.\n\nThus the laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation, but what they followed. Their punishments were not their own invention, but what they upheld. This is the Dao of supreme virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world with the Way is not to alter human nature, but to follow what already exists and let it flow freely. Thus, to follow is to become great; to force is to become small.\n\nAncient waterway builders followed the flow of water, farmers followed the suitability of the land, and warriors followed the desires of the people. To follow naturally is to be invincible under Heaven.\n\nAll things have their natural order, and human affairs have their proper governance. Therefore, the ancient kings established laws by aligning with human nature and setting appropriate boundaries. Without their inherent nature, people cannot be made to conform to teachings. Without their resources, they cannot be made to follow the Way.\n\nHuman nature contains the potential for virtue and righteousness, yet without the Sage’s laws and measures, they cannot be directed aright. By guiding them away from what they dislike, punishments are rendered unnecessary, and authority becomes as potent as the divine. To align with their nature is to have the world obey; to defy it is to see laws enacted yet ignored.\n\nVirtue and the Way are the foundation of merit and renown, what the people cherish. When cherished, merit and renown are established.\n\nThe ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after the rivers and seas: the rivers and seas achieve greatness through non-action, broaden themselves through humility, and thus endure. They become the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they receive all rivers; through not seeking, they obtain all; through not striving, they arrive. Thus they take the world without conflict.\n\nBy not self-aggrandizing, they grow rich; by not self-displaying, they grow clear; by not self-exalting, they endure. Dwelling in unremarkable places, they become kings of the world. By not contending, none can contend with them. By never striving to be great, they achieve greatness. The rivers and seas are close to the Way, and thus endure, preserving themselves alongside Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen public rectitude and the Way are cultivated, merit is achieved without possession. Without possession, strength is unshaken. Unshaken yet not tyrannical over others, deep in the Way, deep in virtue, merit and renown are thus fulfilled. This is called profound virtue! Profound! It transcends all things and returns to their origin.\n\nThe world has a beginning, yet none know its principle, save the sage who alone understands its source.\nNeither male nor female, neither yin nor yang,\nLife yet never dies—\nHeaven and Earth are formed by it,\nYin and Yang take shape through it,\nAll things arise from it.\n\nThus yin and yang,\nHave roundness and angularity,\nShortness and length,\nPreservation and destruction—\nThe Dao names them all.\nDeep and hidden yet luminous in its workings,\nIn the heart, it is subtle,\nIn the Way, it is fitting.\nLife and death share the same principle,\nAll things change and merge into One Dao.\n\nTo disregard life, to forget death—\nWhere would one not grow old?\nTo abandon action and speech—\nBe cautious of inaction.\n\nTo uphold the Dao with thoroughness,\nOne does not slaughter things.\nIn its utmost subtlety, it is formless—\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth.\nAll things conform to the Dao yet differ in form—\nIn its utmost subtlety, it is without substance,\nAnd thus can encompass all with care.\nIn its utmost greatness, it has no bounds—\nIt shelters all things beneath.\nIn its utmost refinement, it is without interior—\nIt is the treasure of all things.\n\nThe Dao sustains life,\nVirtue shapes existence—\nThe measure of the utmost Dao:\nAbandoning preference and aversion,\nWithout knowing yet without fault,\nAdjusting intentions to harmonize the heart,\nNever opposing the Way.\n\nNow Heaven and Earth,\nConcentrated, become One,\nDivided, become Two,\nInteracting, they unite—\nAbove and below, they never fail.\nConcentrated, they become One,\nDivided, they become Five,\nYet when they return, they must align with the square and the compass.\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be slighted,\nMost near yet cannot be distanced—\nSeeking it in the near, one goes and returns.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Emperor* has a name, yet none know his nature;\n*The Emperor* values virtue,\nThe king prizes righteousness,\nThe hegemon is constrained by principle.\n\nThe sage’s Way is without partiality—\nThe Way is first, then wisdom is employed,\nVirtue is thin, then form is applied,\nInsight is shallow, then discernment is used.\nThose who rely on wisdom have troubled hearts,\nThose who rely on punishment have resentment above and below,\nThose who rely on discernment seek favor from the superior to serve their own ends—\nThus they bring ruin.\n\nTherefore the sage follows the transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd his virtue is like Heaven’s canopy and Earth’s foundation.\nThe Way is practiced in due measure,\nAnd his nourishment is profound.\nProfound nourishment brings order—\nEven gods and saints cannot easily surpass it.\n\nAbandoning the heart’s schemes,\nPunishments are reduced—\nReturning to purity and stillness,\nThings will naturally align.\n\nThe Dao as ruler is like a corpse—\nSolemn and silent,\nYet the world receives its blessings.\nOne person benefits from it without partiality,\nTen thousand benefit without favoritism.\n\nThus heavy kindness is as harmful as heavy cruelty—\nBoth deviate from the Way.\nHeavy kindness spreads gifts,\nBestowing rewards without merit,\nGranting honors without labor—\nThen those who hold office slack in their duties,\nWhile idlers rush forward in ambition.\n\nHeavy cruelty is arbitrary execution,\nDeath without fault,\nPunishment of the righteous—\nThen those who cultivate their conduct do not encourage goodness,\nWhile the wicked dare to defy their superiors.\n\nThus heavy kindness breeds deceit,\nHeavy cruelty breeds chaos—\nDeceit and chaos are the winds of fallen states.\n\nTherefore when punishments are meted out, the ruler feels no anger,\nWhen rewards are given, the sovereign does not share—\nThe punished do not blame the ruler,\nFor the punishment is just.\nThe rewarded do not credit the sovereign,\nFor the reward is earned.\nThe people know that punishments and rewards arise from their own deeds,\nThus they strive in their duties and cultivate their arts—\nNo gifts are received from others.\nHence the court is uncluttered yet without neglect,\nThe fields are open yet without filth—\nThus the *Taishang* knows yet does not possess.\n\nThe kingly Way is to dwell in the affairs of non-action,\nTo practice the teaching of non-speech,\nTo be pure and still, unmoved—\nTo measure once and never sway.\nTo follow naturally, to let things unfold,\nTo complete without labor,\nTo plan without losing strategy,\nTo act without error,\nTo speak without ornaments,\nTo move without display,\nTo advance and retreat in accord with the times,\nTo act and rest in harmony with principle—\nNeither loving nor hating beauty and ugliness,\nNeither rejoicing nor angering in rewards and punishments.\n\nNames are self-bestowed,\nKinds are self-classified,\nAffairs arise from nature—\nNone originate from oneself.\nIf one attempts to constrain them,\nOne only drives them further away.\nIf one attempts to embellish them,\nOne only robs them of their truth.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* is the spirit,\nEarth’s *qi* is the ether—\nReversed, they are profound and mysterious,\nEach dwelling in its proper place,\nGuarding them without loss,\nAscending to the *Taiyi* (Supreme Unity),\nThe essence of the *Taiyi* merging with Heaven.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is silent and silent again—\nWithout measure, without rule,\nGreat beyond extremity,\nDeep beyond measure,\nEver transforming with humanity,\nWisdom cannot grasp it—\nIts revolutions are endless,\nIts transformations divine,\nIts emptiness follows without leading.\nWhen it governs and orders,\nIt is a heart of voidness, a spirit of weakness—\nYet clear and undimmed.\nThus all ministers gather like spokes to the hub,\nNone, whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nFail to give their utmost—\nThe sovereign gains the means to govern his ministers,\nThe ministers gain the means to serve their sovereign,\nAnd thus the Way of governing the state is made clear.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those who know and love to ask are sages,\nThose who are courageous and love to ask are conquerors.*\n*He who rides upon the wisdom of the multitude can accomplish anything,\nHe who uses the strength of the multitude can overcome anything.*\n*He who uses the strength of the multitude need not rely on Wu Ge,\nHe who rides upon the power of the multitude need not rely on the world’s might.*\n*Without authority, one cannot wield power,\nYet failing to follow the natural order of things,\nEven sages cannot achieve renown.\"*\n\nTherefore the sage, when acting,\nNever fails to use their resources as they should—\nOne with a form occupies a place,\nOne with ability serves a task.\nIf their strength exceeds their role,\nThe burden of the one who raises them is not heavy.\nIf their ability exceeds their task,\nThe one who employs them finds no difficulty.\n\nThe sage combines and utilizes all—\nThus no person is cast aside, no talent neglected.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"So-called non-action is not to say that things are not drawn near when invited,\nNor pushed away when repelled,\nNor that they do not respond when pressed,\nNor that they are unmoved when stirred—\nNor that they are rigid and stagnant, yet do not flow,\nNor that they are coiled and grasped, yet do not disperse.*\n*It means that private desires do not intrude upon public Dao,\nThat cravings do not cling to proper methods—*\n*To act in accordance with principle,\nTo establish merit through one’s resources,\nTo follow the natural momentum of things,*\n*Yet if one forces them, they cannot be contained—*\n*To achieve success yet never claim it for oneself,*\n*To set up merit yet never possess its name.*\n*As water carries boats,\nAs ice aids the skater,\nAs mud supports the plow,\nAs mountains anchor the cart—*\n*Summer’s floods, winter’s shallows,*\n*High becomes mountain, low becomes pool,*\n*None of this is my doing.\"*\n\nThe Sage does not shame himself for lowly station,\nBut hates the Dao’s failure to prevail.\nHe does not grieve his life’s short span,\nBut mourns the people’s dire want.\nThus ever empty, ever non-acting,\nHe embraces simplicity, reveals the unadorned,\nAnd does not mingle with the myriad things.\n\nLaozi says: The ancient founders of imperial rule\nDid not establish it to indulge their desires.\nThe Sage who ascends the throne\nDoes not seek ease and pleasure for himself.\nFor the people of the world—\nThe strong oppress the weak,\nThe many tyrannize the few,\nThe cunning deceive the simple,\nThe bold assault the timid,\nAnd those who hoard wisdom and guile\nDo not share it with others,\nNor distribute their wealth.\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established\nTo unify and harmonize them.\n\nOne man’s wisdom cannot illuminate the land,\nSo the Three Ministers and Nine Officials are appointed\nTo assist and support him.\nFor distant lands and alien customs,\nUnreached by his grace,\nThe feudal lords are set in place\nTo teach and guide them.\nThus, the heavens and four seasons respond in kind,\nNo official matter remains concealed,\nNo national benefit is overlooked—\nAll are employed to clothe the cold, feed the hungry,\nSustain the aged and infirm,\nAnd rest the weary.\n\nShennong’s form was wasted,\nYao grew emaciated,\nShun’s skin darkened,\nYu’s hands were calloused.\nYi Yin carried a cauldron to serve Tang,\nZhuge Liang wielded a butcher’s knife before entering Zhou,\nBai Li Xi was sold into servitude,\nGuan Zhong was bound in chains,\nConfucius lacked a black ox for sacrifice,\nMozi had no warm seat—\nNot for greed of office or love of rank,\nBut to awaken the world’s benefit,\nTo remove the harm from all people.\n\nFrom the Son of Heaven to the commoner,\nNo one’s limbs grow idle,\nNo one’s thoughts remain unburdened,\nYet all find their needs met—\nSuch has never been heard of.\n\nLaozi says: The Son of Heaven\nStands upon the Heavenly Dao to govern the world.\nThe Dao of governing the world\nHolds to One as its safeguard,\nReturns to the Root with non-action,\nIs empty and tranquil, without possession,\nFleeting yet boundless,\nFar-reaching yet without end,\nVisible yet without form,\nAudible yet without sound—\nThis is called the essence of the Great Dao.\n\nLaozi says: The Dao\nEmbraces the round yet follows the square,\nBacks the shady, cradles the sunny,\nLeft is soft, right is firm,\nTreads the obscure while wearing the bright,\nTransforms without constancy,\nDraws from the One its origin,\nTo respond to the boundless—\nThis is called divine illumination.\n\nHeaven is round yet has no end,\nThus it cannot be observed;\nEarth is square yet has no boundary,\nThus no one can spy its gate.\nHeaven’s transformations flow without form,\nEarth’s growth extends without measure.\n\nThings have their masters,\nBut the Dao has none—\nFor it has no fixed shape or force.\nLike a wheel turning without form,\nIt mirrors the sun and moon’s revolutions,\nLike the seasons’ succession,\nDay and night’s cycle—\nEnding to begin anew,\nBrightness fading into darkness.\nIt shapes without form,\nThus its work is accomplished.\nIt nurtures all things without being possessed,\nThus it conquers without being overcome.\n\nThe warrior who fights in temples becomes an emperor,\nThe sage who transforms through spirit becomes a king.\nThe warrior who fights in temples follows the Heavenly Dao,\nThe sage who transforms through spirit aligns with the four seasons,\nCorrecting within his borders,\nWhile distant lands embrace his virtue.\nHe conquers before battle is joined,\nAnd the feudal lords come as guests in submission.\n\nThe ancients who attained the Dao\nWere still yet modeled the heavens and earth,\nWere active yet followed the sun and moon,\nTheir joy and anger harmonized with the four seasons.\nTheir commands resounded like thunder,\nTheir breath and qi did not clash with the eight winds,\nTheir bending and stretching did not violate the five phases.\nThey followed the people’s desires,\nRode the people’s strength,\nRemoved their残害 for them.\nThose who share the same benefit will die for each other,\nThose who share the same sentiment will succeed together,\nThose who walk the same path will aid each other.\nMove in accordance with their nature,\nAnd the world becomes a single family.\n\nThus, the skilled warrior\nUses their own strength,\nThe unskilled warrior\nUses others’ strength for himself.\nIf he uses their own strength,\nNo one in the world cannot be used.\nIf he uses others’ strength for himself,\nNot a single person can be employed.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Lower Virtue**\n\nLaozi says: To govern oneself, the highest priority is to nourish the spirit (*shén*), the next to nourish the form (*xíng*). When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, all hundred joints are at ease—this is the foundation of life-nourishment. Plump flesh and full belly, indulging in appetites—these are the superficial aspects of life-nourishment.\n\nTo govern a state, the highest priority is to nourish the natural order (*huà*), the next to uphold the laws. When people vie in yielding and humility, compete in receiving little of wealth and profit, and vie in embracing laborious tasks, day by day the natural order ascends and virtue improves—this, without knowing how, is the foundation of governance. When rewards and benefits encourage virtue, and fear of punishment prevents wrongdoing, laws and commands are established above while the people submit below—this is the superficial aspect of governance. In the ancient age, the foundation was cultivated, while in the later age, the superficial was attended to.\n\nLaozi says: A ruler capable of governance does not appear in every age, nor does a minister capable of governance appear in every thousand. Seeking the latter with the former, this is why even the most refined governance is not found once in a thousand years.\n\nThe achievements of hegemons (*bàwáng*) are not established in every age. If one aligns with the people’s benevolent intentions and guards against their deceitful hearts, sharing the same Dao with them, then the people can be virtuous and customs refined.\n\nWhat is precious about the Sage is not their imposition of punishments for crimes, but their understanding of where disorder arises. If one sharpens their malicious inclinations and lets them run wild in licentiousness and depravity, then abandons them to the law and follows them with punishment, even if one slaughters and plunders the world, they cannot suppress its deceit.\n\nLaozi says: If one’s body rests above the rivers and seas, yet their heart lies beneath the palace gates, then they hold life dear, and cherishing life means they will not covet profit. If they cannot conquer themselves yet force others to submit, this is called harming oneself. Those who harm themselves will have no longevity.\n\nHence it is said: Knowing harmony is knowing constancy, knowing constancy is knowing wisdom, increasing life is auspiciousness, and directing the mind to move *qi* is strength—this is called the Mysterious Unity. Use its light, and return to its wisdom.\n\nLaozi says: Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing is harder than not doing good. What is called doing good is to remain still and take no action, to follow one’s nature and abandon excess, to avoid all temptations and inducements, to follow one’s nature and preserve truth, to have no change within oneself. Hence, it is said that doing good is easy.\n\nWhat is called not doing good is hard: usurpation and regicide, deceit and hypocrisy, impetuosity and excessive desires—these are not in accord with human nature. Hence, it is said that not doing good is hard.\n\nNow, what is considered the greatest calamity arises from the absence of constancy, satiety, and moderation. Therefore, in matters of profit and harm, and at the juncture of misfortune and fortune, one must be vigilant.\n\nThe Sage has no desires, no evasions. If one pursues something, they may lose it; if one avoids something, they may gain it. If one’s resolve has something it desires, they will forget their purpose. This is why the Sage carefully discerns the changes between action and stillness, and adjusts their reception and giving accordingly. They harmonize the emotions of love and hate, and balance the rhythms of joy and anger.\n\nIf action and stillness are well-managed, calamity will not invade. If reception and giving are appropriate, guilt will not accumulate. If love and hate are properly balanced, sorrow will not approach. If joy and anger are harmonized, resentment will not arise.\n\nThose who embody the Dao do not seek gains lightly nor shirk misfortune. If they do not abandon, it is not because they cannot restrain themselves, but because they are always full yet never overflowing, always empty yet easily replenished.\n\nHence, if one governs themselves with Daoist principles and moderation, then food will suffice to fill their emptiness, clothing to ward off cold, and this will be enough to ensure warmth and sustenance for their seven-foot form. Without Daoist principles and moderation, even if they demand the trappings of honor and nobility, the power of ten thousand chariots will not bring them satisfaction, nor will the wealth of the world bring them joy. Thus, the Sage remains tranquil in heart and easy in resolve, guarding their spirit within, and external things cannot disturb them.\n\nLaozi says: Those who overcome others have strength, those who overcome themselves are strong. To be strong, one must necessarily employ others’ strength, and to employ others’ strength, one must necessarily win others’ hearts. To win others’ hearts, one must necessarily attain self-mastery. There has never been one who attained themselves yet lost others, nor one who lost themselves yet gained others.\n\nHence, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people, the foundation of calming the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency, the foundation of sufficiency lies in not encroaching upon their natural rhythms, the foundation of not encroaching lies in reducing their burdens, the foundation of reducing burdens lies in moderating their desires, the foundation of moderation lies in removing arrogance, and the foundation of removing arrogance lies in emptiness and non-being. Thus, those who know the nature of life do not labor for what they cannot attain, and those who know the nature of fate do not worry over what they cannot control.\n\nThe eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds—when the seven orifices vie in contention, they harm the singular nature (*yīxìng*). Day by day, they draw out licentious desires and exhaust their natural harmony (*tiān hé*). Even their own bodies cannot be governed, let alone the world. Those who claim to have gained the world are not those who occupy power and titles, assume noble names, or speak of ruling the world’s heart and strength. With the name of kingship yet no one’s praise, this is to have lost the world.\n\nHence, Jie and Zhou were not true kings, nor were Tang and Wu mere bandits. When the world gains the Dao, it rests in guarding the four frontier regions (*sìyí*), when the world loses the Dao, it rests in the hands of the feudal lords. When feudal lords gain the Dao, they rest in guarding their borders, when they lose the Dao, they rest in their own retainers. Hence it is said: Do not rely on others taking from you, but rely on your inability to be taken from. Practicing the Dao that can be seized, yet not engaging in usurpation and regicide, is of no benefit in maintaining the world.\n\nLaozi says: The skilled ruler of a state does not alter their established ways nor change their constants. Anger is contrary to virtue, arms are instruments of violence, and contention is the source of disorder. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue, delighting in violence is the use of instruments of violence, and managing disorder is the height of contradiction.\n\nIt is not possible to create calamity without harming others. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their chaos, soften their brilliance, and equalize their dust. All people’s emotions and inclinations wish to be virtuous themselves yet resent others not reaching them. Wishing to be virtuous themselves gives rise to contentious hearts, resenting others not reaching them gives rise to grievances and contention. When grievances and contention arise, the heart is disordered and *qi* is rebellious. Hence, the ancient Sages retreated from contention and grievance. When contention and grievance do not arise, the heart is governed and *qi* is harmonious. Hence it is said: Do not exalt the virtuous, so that the people do not contend.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Those who govern things do not rely on things to achieve harmony; those who govern harmony do not rely on harmony to govern people; those who govern people do not rely on people to govern the ruler; those who govern the ruler do not rely on the ruler to govern desires; those who govern desires do not rely on desires to govern nature; those who govern nature do not rely on nature to govern virtue; those who govern virtue do not rely on virtue to govern the Dao/Way.\n\nTo govern with the Dao/Way as the foundation of people’s nature, there is no perversion or impurity. If one lingers long among things, they forget their foundation, and thus align with the nature of things.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs are not the nature of people; they are imposed from without. Thus, when people’s nature is balanced, excessive desires harm them. Only those who follow the Dao/Way can abandon things and return to their true selves.\n\nIf one can self-reflect, they will not lose the essence of things; if they cannot, their actions will only breed confusion and deceit.\n\nTo indulge desires is to lose one’s nature; when actions are unrestrained, they are never correct. To govern life with such unrestrained actions is to lose one’s body; to govern the state is to incite chaos among the people. Hence, those who do not hear the Dao/Way cannot return to their true nature.\n\nThe ancient Sages understood all from within themselves, so their commands were carried out and forbidden acts ceased. When undertaking any matter, one must first calm their intentions and clarify their mind. When the mind is clear and intentions are calm, then the affairs of things can be set right.\n\nTo hear only praise or blame, to gaze lustfully upon colors and hues, makes it difficult to achieve order in governance. Hence, the value of emptiness.\n\nThus, water stirred will raise waves, and rebellious *qi* will cloud the mind. A clouded mind cannot govern correctly, and waves cannot settle into stillness. Therefore, the ancient Sages held to the One, to regulate the emotions and inclinations of things.\n\nThe One is the most precious, without limit in the world. The ancient Sages entrusted themselves to the limitless, thus they could command all under Heaven.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Yin and Yang refine all things, all riding upon the One *qi* to emerge. When the ruler and subjects are divided in heart, *qi* ascends and stagnates. When the ruler and ministers are not in harmony, the five grains do not flourish. When spring is stern and autumn withers, when winter thunders and summer frosts, these are all born of the disruption of *qi*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is but one body; within the six directions, there is but one form. Thus, those who understand nature cannot be coerced by Heaven and Earth, and those who discern omens cannot be deceived by strange creatures.\n\nThe Sages know the near to understand the far, considering ten thousand *li* as one measure. When *qi* rises to Heaven and Earth, rites, justice, and propriety are not established, and the people all violate one another, committing cruelty and violence. This arises from their being lost in the murky chaos.\n\nWhen justice and shame are neglected, and the age declines, harm increases while wealth diminishes. Labor is excessive while sustenance is insufficient. The people grow poor and wretched, and resentment and contention arise. Hence, the value of *ren*.\n\nWhen people are coarse and unequal, forming cliques and factions, each promoting their own, harboring cunning and deceitful hearts, hence the value of *yi*.\n\nWhen men and women dwell together without distinction, hence the value of rites.\n\nWhen the emotions of life are unrestrained and press upon one another in desperation, they become discordant. Hence, the value of music.\n\nThus, *ren*, *yi*, rites, and music are means to remedy failures, not universal paths to governance.\n\nIf one can truly settle the mind and return to its original state, then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang will follow and encompass them, ensuring wealth and nourishment for all. The hearts of greed, coarseness, resentment, and contention will not arise.\n\n*Ren* and *yi* do not harm, while virtue and the Dao/Way are established, and the world is governed. The people will not indulge in colors and hues. Thus, when virtue decays, *ren* and *yi* are adorned; when harmony is lost, music is adjusted; when rites are violated, appearance is refined.\n\nHence, knowing the Dao/Way and virtue, one then knows that *ren* and *yi* are insufficient for action; knowing *ren* and *yi*, one then knows that rites and music are insufficient for cultivation.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Governance through purity and stillness is to be in harmony and order, yet tranquil and unassuming. It is simple and true, yet undyed and unadorned. It is calm and quiet, yet not restless. Within, it aligns with the Dao/Way; without, it conforms with *yi*. Its words are concise yet follow principle; its actions are pleasing yet accord with human nature. Its heart is harmonious yet unfeigned; its affairs are plain yet undecorated. It does not contrive beginnings nor debate endings. It remains settled when at ease, and moves when stirred. Its body resonates with Heaven and Earth, its essence with Yin and Yang. It harmonizes with the four seasons, its radiance with the sun and moon. It acts in accordance with the Dao/Way’s transformations, and cunning, mechanical deceit and pretense have no place in its heart.\n\nThus, Heaven covers with virtue, Earth bears with music. The four seasons do not lose their order, winds and rains do not act capriciously. The sun and moon are pure and still, shining forth their light. The five stars do not lose their courses—this is the clarity of purity and stillness.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: In a well-governed age, the duties of governance are easily upheld, its affairs are easily managed, its rites are easily followed, its rewards are easily bestowed.\n\nThus, one person does not hold multiple offices, and an official does not hold the rank of a scholar. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants dwell in separate districts and states, so farmers speak of farming to farmers, scholars speak of conduct to scholars, artisans speak of skill to artisans, and merchants speak of numbers to merchants.\n\nThus, scholars have no neglected conduct, artisans no laborious tasks, farmers no wasted effort, and merchants no losses in trade—each finds contentment in their nature.\n\nThough forms and types differ, their affairs are simple yet not contradictory. When placed in lowly positions, they are despised; when in power, they are honored.\n\nThose who possess foresight and far-reaching vision are the most talented, yet in a well-governed age, they are not burdened with responsibilities. Those who are widely learned and resolute in will, quick-tongued and eloquent, are the most knowledgeable, yet enlightened rulers do not seek such qualities from their subjects. Those who scorn the world and hold others in contempt, who do not conform to common customs, are the most virtuous in conduct, yet in a well-governed age, they are not used to transform the people.\n\nHence, those whose height is unattainable are not set as measures for others; those whose conduct cannot be emulated are not made the customs of the state. Thus, individual talents cannot be monopolized, while measures, virtue, and Dao/Way can be passed down through the ages.\n\nTherefore, when a state is well-governed, even the foolish can uphold it; and its military can be organized by law alone. It does not depend on ancient heroes, but the people are naturally sufficient—using what they possess and combining their strengths.\n\nThe laws of the declining age set high standards yet punishments do not reach those who fail; impose heavy burdens yet penalties cannot overcome the offense; establish perilous dangers yet executions are not dared. The people are burdened by these three demands, and thus feign cleverness to deceive their superiors, act wickedly, and court danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot be deterred from their deceit.\n\nThe beasts when driven to extremity will gore, the birds when driven to extremity will peck, and humankind when driven to extremity will deceive—this is what is meant.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe thunderous voice of *lei-ting* can be imitated by bells and drums,\nthe shifts of wind and rain can be known through music’s tones.\nWhat is vast enough to be seen can be measured,\nwhat is bright enough to be seen can be obscured,\nwhat can be heard can be tuned,\nwhat can be observed can be distinguished.\nYet what is supremely vast, even heaven and earth cannot contain it,\nand what is supremely subtle, even the divine cannot perceive it.\nWhen laws are established, the five colors distinguished,\npure and turbid separated, flavors of sweet and bitter discerned—\nthen the uncarved block is scattered into tools.\n\nWhen *ren* and *yi* are instituted, and rites and music refined,\nvirtue/power shifts into artifice.\nThe people adorn their cunning to astonish the simple,\nemploy deceit to assault their superiors—\nthough some may uphold such ways, none can govern by them.\n\nThe more clever one becomes, the more virtue/power decays.\nThus, the sage remains pure and undivided.\n\nThe sage’s governance is empty, silent, and still—\nno desires are seen, the heart and spirit dwell in harmony,\nthe form aligns with nature, and movement flows with principle.\nFollowing the Dao/Way naturally, acting only when unavoidable—\nwithout action, the world finds peace;\nwithout desire, the people return to simplicity;\nwithout resentment, resources suffice.\nThose who seek do not obtain, those who receive do not refuse—\nvirtue/power returns of its own accord, yet none bestows it.\n\nSpeech without words, the Dao/Way without teaching—\nif one attains this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury.\nTake from it without depletion, draw from it without exhaustion—\nnone know its source, yet it is called *yao-guang*,\nthe *yao-guang* being the sustenance of all things.\n\nLaozi said:\nHeaven cherishes its essence, earth cherishes its level,\nhumankind cherishes its emotions—\nthe essence of heaven: sun, moon, stars, thunder, wind, and rain;\nthe level of earth: water, fire, metal, wood, and soil;\nthe emotions of humankind: thought, perception, cleverness, joy, and anger.\nThus, close the four gates, halt the five paths,\nand you will merge with the Dao/Way.\nThe divine hides in formlessness, the essence returns to truth—\neyes bright yet do not see, ears keen yet do not listen,\nthe mouth speaks rightly yet does not speak,\nthe heart’s clarity flows yet does not deliberate.\nSurrender without action, know without arrogance,\nalign with nature’s essence, and harm cannot touch you.\nEssence in the eyes sharpens vision,\nin the ears sharpens hearing,\nin the mouth ensures truthfulness,\nin the heart ensures wisdom—\nthus, closing the four gates brings lifelong peace.\nThe four limbs and nine orifices know neither death nor life—\nthis is called the True Person.\n\nEarth’s production of wealth relies on no more than the Five Phases;\nthe sage regulates the Five Phases, and governance does not falter.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe balance’s equilibrium between left and right,\nwithout partiality in lightness or weight, thus it can be level.\nThe plumb line’s alignment within and without,\nwithout partiality in crookedness or straightness, thus it can be true.\nThe ruler’s adherence to law,\nwithout partiality in favor or dislike, thus it can be command.\nWhen virtue/power has no foundation, resentment has no place—\nthis is to entrust oneself to the Dao/Way and harmonize with human hearts.\n\nThus, those who govern should not interfere—\nwater overturns the boat, wood strikes the axle,\nyet blame is not placed on wood or stone but on clumsy skill.\nWisdom cannot bear this.\nHence, when the Dao/Way has wisdom, chaos ensues;\nwhen virtue/power has intent, danger arises;\nwhen the mind has eyes, dizziness follows.\n\nThe scales, compass, and square—\nfixed and unchanging, ever consistent and unerring,\nmoving straight without hesitation—\nonce shaped, they endure for ten thousand generations,\nyet their essence is *wuwei*.\n\nPeople say:\nA state has a doomed ruler, an age doomed by its Dao/Way,\nbut a person may reach exhaustion while principle remains unbroken.\nThus, *wuwei* is the essence of the Dao/Way.\nAttaining the Dao/Way’s essence,\nits responses are boundless—\nyet without relying on the numbers of principle,\nbut solely on one’s own capacity,\none’s limits are distant.\n\nThe sovereign need not leave the palace to know the world—\nobserve things to know things, observe people to know people.\nThus, the strength gathered can overcome all,\nthe collective wisdom can achieve all.\nA thousand-strong force lacks no provisions,\na ten-thousand-strong host lacks no purpose—\nartisans have no conflicting skills,\nscholars hold no dual offices,\neach guards their duty, none encroaches,\npeople find their place, things find their rest—\nthus, tools are not despised, duties are not neglected.\n\nWhen demands are few, they are easily met;\nwhen duties are few, they are easily upheld;\nwhen burdens are light, effort is encouraged.\nThe ruler holds a modest share, the people achieve effortless success—\nthus, even after long years, they do not grow weary.\n\nLaozi said:\nThe *Di* embodies the *Taiyi*,\nthe *Wang* follows *yin-yang*,\nthe *Ba* conforms to the four seasons,\nthe *Jun* employs the six *lü*.\nTo embody the *Taiyi* is to understand heaven and earth’s nature,\nto harmonize with the moral order of virtue/power and Dao/Way,\nto shine with the clarity of sun and moon,\nto resonate with the spirit of all things,\nto move and rest in accord with *yin-yang*,\nto temper anger with the four seasons—\nall things, great and small, depend on virtue/power for life.\nVirtue/power extends beyond the realm, its fame endures through ages.\n\nTo follow *yin-yang* is to inherit heaven and earth’s harmony,\nto share virtue/power with heaven and earth,\nto shine with the brilliance of sun and moon,\nto match the spirits with the divine—\nto walk squarely, stand upright,\nto align the drum and plumb line within,\nto regulate the body internally, win hearts externally,\nto issue commands—all under heaven follows the wind.\nThe four seasons: spring grows, summer lengthens,\nautumn harvests, winter stores—\ngiving and taking are measured, entry and exit are quantified,\njoy and anger, firmness and gentleness, never stray from principle.\nGentle yet not brittle, firm yet not rigid,\nbroad yet not licentious, solemn yet not rebellious—\neasy and yielding, nurturing all beings,\nits virtue encompasses the foolish and contains the unworthy,\nyet it loves none in particular.\n\nTo employ the Six Pitches is to give life and to take it,\nto bestow rewards and to mete out punishments,\nto grant and to seize—\nwithout these, there is no Dao.\n\nTo strike down chaos and curb violence,\nto elevate the worthy and discard the unworthy,\nto correct the crooked and restore the straight,\nto embrace the perilous and make it secure,\nto bend the twisted and make it upright—\nthis is the Way of issuing commands,\nthe means to open blockages.\n\nTo harness the times and leverage circumstances,\nto serve and guide the hearts of the people—\nthis is how one governs.\n\nThe **Son of Heaven** attunes to **yin-yang** and rests,\nthe **King** follows the Four Seasons and is diminished,\nthe **Conqueror** employs the Six Pitches and is shamed,\nthe **Lord** loses his plumb line and is deposed.\n\nThus, when small in action yet grand in effect, one is confined and distant;\nwhen grand in action yet small in effect, one is narrow and unyielding.\n\n**Laozi** said:\n*\"Though the land be vast and the people many, this cannot make one strong;\nthough armor be hard and weapons sharp, this cannot ensure victory;\nthough walls be high and moats deep, this cannot make one secure;\nthough punishments be severe and laws harsh, this cannot establish true威.\"*\n\nFor those who preserve their governance, even smallness must endure;\nfor those who lose their governance, even greatness must perish.\n\nThus, the skilled defender needs no rival to resist,\nthe skilled warrior needs no rival to fight,\nharnessing the times and circumstances,\naligning with the people’s desires—\nand all under heaven submits.\n\nTherefore, the skilled ruler accumulates **virtue**,\nthe skilled warrior stores his **anger**,\nfor **virtue** accumulated makes the people obedient,\nand **anger** stored establishes **威**.\n\nWhere **文** is applied deeply,\nthe **权** that submits is vast;\nwhere **德** is bestowed broadly,\nthe **威** that commands is wide—\nwide and yet adaptable, strong and yet yielding.\n\nThe skilled warrior weakens his enemy first, then engages in battle—\nthus his costs are halved while his gains are tenfold.\n\nTherefore, a realm of a thousand chariots ruled by **文德** becomes a **Kingdom**,\na realm of ten thousand chariots fond of war perishes—\nthe **King’s** forces first secure victory, then fight,\nthe **defeated’s** forces first fight, then seek victory—\nthis is ignorance of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Upper Virtue**\n\n「The Master Laozi says: The **Dao/Way** of the **君子** is to remain **静** in order to cultivate the self, and to practice **俭** to nourish life. **静** means the lower does not disturb; the lower not disturbed means the people do not grumble. When the lower disturbs, governance is chaotic; when the people grumble, **virtue/power** is thin. In chaos, the wise do not plot for him; with thin **virtue/power**, the brave do not fight for him.\n\nBut the disordered ruler is otherwise: in one day he may possess the wealth of the world, wield the power of a sovereign, exhaust the people’s strength, and indulge the desires of his ears and eyes. His mind is fixed on palaces, pavilions, moats, and gardens filled with rare beasts and strange treasures. The common folk suffer hunger and cold, while his halls are adorned with embroidered silks. Thus, though the ruler hoards these useless things, the world does not find peace in his reign.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Without **惔漠** (indifference), one cannot clarify **德** (**virtue/power**). Without **宁静** (tranquility), one cannot attain the distant. Without **宽大** (magnanimity), one cannot unite and cover all. Without **正平** (justice and fairness), one cannot make judgments. To see with the eyes of the world, to hear with the ears of the world, to deliberate with the hearts of the world, and to contend with the strength of the world—thus his commands can reach the depths, and the emotions of his subjects can ascend to his ears. All officials follow their duties in order, and ministers gather like spokes to the hub.\n\nHe does not reward for joy, nor punish for anger. His laws and decrees are clear yet not harsh; his senses are open yet not obscured. The merits and faults of his subjects are laid before him daily, yet he does not resist them. Thus the wise exhaust their intelligence, the unworthy exert their strength, those near secure their livelihood, and those far away cherish his **德** (**virtue/power**). This is the **Dao/Way** of employing people.\n\nHe who rides in the royal carriage does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*. He who sails in a boat does not swim yet crosses rivers and seas. If a man’s words are true, even though he be a common laborer or herdsman, he must not be discarded. If a man’s words are false, even though he be a king or prime minister, he must not be used. The judgment of truth and falsehood cannot be decided by rank or status.\n\nThe wise do not shame those whose counsel is useful, nor do they prize those whose words are merely eloquent. The foolish ruler is otherwise: those ministers who sincerely offer their loyalty, he seldom employs, while he favors those who are familiar with deceit and perversion. The wise he cannot see, nor does he hear the words of those who are distant and lowly, though they exert their strength in loyalty.\n\nHe who speaks is challenged with words, he who remonstrates is punished with crimes. Yet such a ruler wishes to bring peace to the seas within his borders and preserve all under heaven—how far he is from wisdom!\n\nThe Master Laozi says: He who can **尊生** (honor life) will not harm his body with wealth and honor, nor burden his form with poverty and meanness. Now, having inherited the noble rank of our ancestors, one must surely cherish the source of life’s origin, yet neglects its loss—is this not perplexing?\n\nTo govern the world with **身** (the self), one may entrust it to the world. To love the world with **身** (the self), one may thereby be entrusted with the world.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: What is the foundation of ruling a state?\n\nThe Master Laozi replied: The foundation lies in governing oneself. Never have I heard of one who governs himself yet brings disorder to his state, nor of one who brings disorder to himself yet governs his state well.\n\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the self, and its **德** (**virtue/power**) will be true.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is so supremely wondrous that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Hence, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: How does one act so that the people love their ruler?\n\nThe Master Laozi replied: One must govern them with due **时** (timing) and treat them with **敬慎** (reverence and caution), as though standing at the edge of a deep abyss or walking on thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good I nurture, the wicked I destroy. In ancient times, the ministers of **夏** and **商**, turning against the tyrants **桀** and **纣**, served **Tāng** and **Wǔ**. The people of **Hòushā** (Hostile Sands), attacking their own ruler, returned to the **Shénnóng** (Divine Farmer). Hence it is said: *“What the people fear, one must not fail to fear.”*\n\nThe Master Laozi says: In governing the great, the **Dao/Way** cannot be small. In lands vast, the rule cannot be narrow. In high stations, affairs cannot be burdensome. In states with many people, instruction cannot be harsh.\n\nBurdensome affairs are hard to govern, harsh laws are hard to enforce, excessive demands are hard to satisfy. Measure by the inch, and even a *zhàng* (ten feet) will be wrong; weigh by the *zhū* (small weight), and even a *dàn* (one hundred *catty*) will be off. Yet if one uses a *zhàng* to measure a *zhàng* and a *dàn* to weigh a *dàn*, few errors will occur. Great comparisons are easily made with wisdom, while intricate arguments are hard to resolve with true insight.\n\nThus, what harms governance yet aids disorder, the sage does not practice; what does not aid utility yet increases expenditure, the wise do not follow.\n\nHence, efforts are not weary of being frugal, affairs are not weary of being simplified, demands are not weary of being few. Frugal efforts are easy to accomplish, simplified affairs are easy to govern, few demands are easy to satisfy, and when entrusted to the common people, it is easy.\n\nThus, petty eloquence harms **义** (righteousness), petty righteousness undermines the **Dao/Way**. If the **Dao/Way** is petty, it will not prevail; if it prevails, it must be simple.\n\nThe river flows far because it winds gently, the mountain stands high because it rises gradually. The **Dao/Way** transforms because it moves effortlessly.\n\nHe who is skilled in one art, precise in one matter, or discerning in one talent may be able to argue cleverly, but cannot apply broadly.\n\nHe who tunes music knows that small strings must be tight and large ones slack. He who establishes affairs knows that the lowly must labor while the noble must rest.\n\nThe words of the **Dao/Way** say: *“Vague and obscure, aligning with heaven’s **威** (awe), harmonizing with heaven’s **气** (qi).”* One who harmonizes with **气** (qi) becomes **帝** (Emperor), one who harmonizes with **义** (righteousness) becomes **王** (King), one who harmonizes with **功** (achievement) becomes **霸** (Hegemon). One who lacks all three perishes.\n\nThus, he does not speak yet is believed, does not act yet is kind, does not rage yet commands **威** (awe). Hence, his transformations move with the **天心** (heavenly intent).\n\nIf he acts yet is not kind, if he speaks yet is not trusted, if he rages yet does not command **威** (awe), then he is merely performing the outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide, even few laws are sufficient for governance. Without the **Dao/Way**, even many laws are sufficient for disorder.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: A whale removed from water is dominated by ants. A ruler who abandons his proper course and contends with his ministers is dominated by his officials. To hold one’s station with **无为** (**wuwei**—non-action), those who guard their duties take pleasure in compliance. The ministers conceal their wisdom and do not use it, instead devoting themselves to the ruler’s affairs.»\n\nThe sovereign who does not rely on able ministers but delights in self-action will find his wisdom daily constrained while bearing sole responsibility. When his schemes are thwarted by inferiors, he cannot rectify matters; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain authority. If his wisdom is insufficient for governance and his **威** (awe) is insufficient to enforce punishment, then he cannot properly engage with his subjects.\n\nWhen joy and anger manifest in his heart and desires are evident in his actions, those who guard their duties abandon principle to curry favor, officials distort the law to follow the wind, rewards do not match merit, and punishments do not fit crimes. Thus, the ruler and subjects diverge in intent, and the sovereign and ministers harbor mutual resentment. Officials grow weary of confusion while the ruler’s wisdom cannot resolve it; slander arises while his discernment cannot illuminate it. When he blames himself for faults not his own, the sovereign’s labor increases while his ministers grow ever more negligent. Hence, even the skilled artisan who hews without measure rarely avoids injuring his hands.\n\nTo race horses with a runner, one’s sinews will snap before catching up; to mount a chariot and seize the reins after the horse has died beneath the yoke, even **伯乐** (Bo Le, the master horse judge) and **王良** (Wang Liang, the master charioteer) cannot revive it. Yet a wise ruler seeks such talents without the labor of judging or driving, thus harnessing others’ excellence.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sovereign is to act without action yet achieve results, to establish without attachment. If one takes a stance, criticism follows; if one takes pleasure, flattery follows. Criticism invites usurpation; flattery invites deception. Those who erect a foundation only to be constrained by others cannot sustain the state. Thus, the skilled founder does not uproot—his structure is formless. Only the **神化** (transcendent transformation) cannot be overcome by anything.\n\nWhen inner desires do not manifest, it is called **道** (the **Dao/Way**); when external deceit does not penetrate, it is called **闭** (closure). When inner and outer are closed, what matter cannot be regulated? When the outer is closed to the inner, what matter cannot be accomplished?\n\nThus, he does not act yet achieves, does not force yet succeeds. His words are not boastful, his deeds are not usurping. He follows names to demand reality, assigning duties to their proper officers. To take **无知** (non-knowing) as the **Dao/Way**, to make **禁苛** (restraining excess) the principle—then all official matters will have their proper measure.\n\nLaozi says: Food is the foundation of people, and the people are the foundation of the state. Therefore, the sovereign must align with the **天时** (heavenly timing) above, exhaust the **地理** (earthly resources) below, and utilize human effort within. Thus, all living things flourish, and the ten thousand things proliferate. In spring, he cuts the withered; in summer, he harvests the fruits; in autumn, he stores vegetables and grains; in winter, he gathers firewood. These are provided for the people, ensuring no scarcity in life and no unburied dead.\n\nThe laws of the ancient kings did not net schools of fish to take the **镺●** (a type of fish), nor did they individually fish in marshes. They did not set fires to hunt in the forests, nor did they allow snares to traverse the wilds before the **豺** (wild dogs) had been sacrificed. They did not cast nets in water before the **獭** (otters) had been sacrificed, nor did they spread traps before the **鹰隼** (hawks and falcons) had struck. They did not fell trees before the foliage had fallen, nor did they burn fields before insects had burrowed. They did not pasture pregnant animals, nor did they take **鷇卵** (eggs of certain birds), nor did they take fish shorter than a **尺** (chi, ~23 cm). They did not slaughter pigs and dogs before they had reached maturity. Thus, all things grew as if steaming from the earth. This was how the ancient kings adapted to the times, ensuring prosperity for the state and benefit for the people. It was not something seen with the eyes and done with the feet—those who sought to benefit the people did not forget it in their hearts, and thus the people prepared themselves.\n\nLaozi says: In ancient times, enlightened rulers moderated their demands on the people and regulated their own sustenance. They calculated the harvests by the year, measured the people’s stored provisions, and knew the surplus and deficit before taking what was due. Thus, they received what heaven and earth bestowed and avoided the perils of hunger and cold.\n\nWhen they shared the people’s hardships—when the state faced famine, their food was unrefined; when the people suffered cold, they did not wear fur in winter—they shared in the people’s joys and sorrows, and thus there were no pitiful subjects under heaven.\n\nBut a tyrannical ruler does otherwise: he exacts labor beyond the people’s strength, demands tribute without regard to their stores. Men and women cannot engage in farming and weaving to supply his demands. Their labor is exhausted, their wealth depleted, with no dawn without toil and no evening of rest. The sovereign and ministers grow to resent each other.\n\nMoreover, in sustaining life, if one person plows and tends the land, the yield from the middle field does not exceed four **石** (dou, ~60 kg). With wives, children, and the elderly depending on it, and occasional calamities, to supply the sovereign’s demands would move even the most compassionate ruler to pity.\n\nGreedy tyrants drain their people like drying up fishponds to satisfy their insatiable desires, and thus the people no longer benefit from the **天和** (heaven’s harmony) or **地德** (earth’s virtue).\n\nLaozi says: The **qi** of heaven and earth finds no greater harmony than **和** (harmony). Harmony is the balance of **阴** (yin) and **阳** (yang), the division of day and night. Thus, all things sprout at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Growth and completion both depend on the essence of harmony.\n\nExcessive **阴** does not generate; excessive **阳** does not transform. Only when **阴** and **阳** interact does harmony emerge. Thus, the **Dao/Way** of the sage is broad yet cautious, stern yet warm, gentle yet upright, fierce yet virtuous.\n\nExcessive rigidity breaks; excessive softness curls. The **Dao/Way** lies in the balance between rigidity and softness.\n\nThe **绳** (plumb line) as a measure can be rolled and carried, stretched and laid straight. It is neither too long nor too short, neither rigid nor slack—thus the sage embodies it.\n\nIf kindness is overused, it becomes weakness; weakness begets no **威** (awe). If sternness is overused, it becomes brutality; brutality breeds no harmony. If love is overused, it becomes indulgence; indulgence begets no order. If punishment is overused, it becomes calamity; calamity breeds no loyalty. Hence, harmony is most valued.\n\nLaozi says: The reason a state endures is that it follows the **Dao/Way**; the reason it perishes is that its governance is blocked. Thus, the sage observes transformations to discern their omens.\n\n**德** (virtue/power) waxes and wanes, and the winds reveal the first signs. Those who grasp the **生道** (way of life) will, though small, become great; those who show signs of ruin, though established, will fail.\n\nA state’s survival does not depend on its greatness; the **Dao/Way**’s practice cannot be dismissed as insignificant. Ruin does not stem from size; destruction comes from losing the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe ruler of a chaotic state seeks vast territory but neglects benevolence and righteousness, pursues high rank but neglects virtue and morality. Thus, they abandon what sustains them and create what brings their ruin.\n\nIf the ruler obscures the luminaries of heaven above and loses the hearts of the people below, who cannot fail to topple? Therefore, those who examine themselves carefully do not rely on others.\n\nThe ancients who practiced the **Dao/Way** called deep practice *virtue/power and morality*, shallow practice *benevolence and righteousness*, and superficial practice *rites and wisdom*. These six aspects are the sinews of the state.\n\nDeep practice brings abundant blessings, shallow practice brings meager blessings, and full practice earns universal submission. In antiquity, cultivating virtue/power and morality rectified the world, cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a kingdom, and cultivating rites and wisdom rectified a village. Those with profound virtue/power became great, those with shallow virtue/power remained small.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** does not rely on brute strength to establish itself, nor on rigidity to triumph, nor on greed to gain. It stands when the world follows it, prevails when the world submits to it, and obtains when it gives to the world—not by seizing. Therefore, yielding establishes it, softness overcomes it, benevolence and righteousness secure it, and non-contention means none can contend with it. Hence, the **Dao/Way** in the world is like the great rivers and seas.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven: those who act against it perish, those who cling to it lose it. If one seeks great fame and strives for it, I see that they cannot help but lose it—even if they grasp it, they cannot retain it. Fame cannot be sought and obtained; it is given by the world. Those to whom the world gives, the world returns to them. What the world returns is *virtue/power*, hence it is said:\n\n*\"The virtuous/powerful of high virtue/power are followed by the world,\nThe benevolent of high benevolence are followed by all within the seas,\nThe righteous of high righteousness are followed by a single kingdom,\nThe ritualists of high rites are followed by a single village.\nWithout these four, the people will not follow.\nIf they do not follow, resorting to arms is perilous.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Warfare is the instrument of last resort, to be used only when unavoidable.\nTo kill and injure people, yet nourish them without delight—\nHence it is said:\n'Where death reigns, thorns and brambles grow,\nThere one weeps with sorrow and dwells with funeral rites.'\nTherefore, the virtuous/powerful cultivate virtue/power and morality,\nAnd do not frequently resort to arms.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: *\"Why are benevolence, righteousness, and rites considered shallow compared to virtue/power and morality?\"*\n\nLaozi replied: *\"Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy,\nThose who practice righteousness must clarify taking and giving.\nWithin the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot reach all,\nAnd exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice to provide for the people.\nThus, it is known that cultivating the **Dao/Way** and practicing virtue/power—\nFollowing the nature of Heaven and Earth—\nAll things will naturally align, and the world will be amply nourished.\nBenevolence and righteousness arise from this.\nHence, the noble man dwells in what is profound,\nNot in what is shallow.\"*\n\nRites are the adornment of substance, benevolence is the manifestation of kindness. Thus, rites follow human sentiment without exceeding it, benevolence does not overflow kindness. Sorrow and grief arise from genuine emotion, and honoring the dead aligns with benevolence.\n\nNurturing life does not force what people cannot achieve, nor does it cut off what they cannot abandon. Moderation in measure ensures nothing is lost, and without false praise, no discord arises. Thus, music is composed to harmonize joy, and happiness does not stray from accord. Clarity in the distinction between life and death, and understanding the balance of extravagance and frugality—these are the ways.\n\nBut in the latter ages, words and deeds contradict, emotions and appearances oppose each other. Rites become burdensome with excess, music becomes chaotic with indulgence. Customs sink into decadence, and false praise flourishes at court. Thus, the sage is abandoned and unused.\n\nChasing a swift horse on foot, a man cannot outpace it, but placing it in a chariot, the horse cannot outpace him. Therefore, those skilled in the **Dao/Way** use others’ strengths to achieve their ends, leveraging what they can against what others cannot.\n\nWhen the ruler acts in season, the people respond with wealth.\nWhen the ruler treats them with rites, the people respond with loyalty.\nWhen the ruler meets them with justice, the people respond with death.\nThus, there are perilous states without secure rulers,\nAnd there are anxious rulers without contented ministers.\n\nVirtue/power exceeding one’s station brings honor,\nWealth exceeding one’s virtue/power brings calamity.\nVirtue/power is valued without limit,\nRighteousness is taken without excess.\nOne does not usurp position through virtue/power,\nNor steal wealth through righteousness.\n\nThe sage finds contentment in poverty and joy in the **Dao/Way**,\nDoes not harm life through desire,\nNor burden oneself with gain.\nThus, they do not violate righteousness to seek security.\n\nIn antiquity, without virtue/power, none were honored,\nWithout ability, none held office,\nWithout merit, none received rewards,\nWithout guilt, none were punished.\nTheir advancement of people was through rites,\nTheir removal of people was through righteousness.\nIn the age of the petty, advancement is like ascending to heaven,\nAnd removal is like descending into the abyss.\nThis speaks to the contrast between antiquity and the present.\n\nSelecting horses, the flaw is seen in their leanness;\nChoosing scholars, the flaw is seen in their poverty.\nFat pigs fill the kitchen,\nWhile emaciated bones hold no office.\n\nThe virtuous/powerful discern truth and do not heed slander.\nTo admonish a ruler who does not listen is not loyalty,\nTo admonish and not be heard is the ruler’s lack of clarity.\nIf the people sink in corruption and the minister does not grieve, this is not wise counsel.\nThus, to guard one’s principles and die in difficulty is the duty of a minister,\nAnd to endure cold and hunger is the kindness of a father.\n\nTo use great matters for small is called *perverting people*,\nTo use small matters against great is called *defying Heaven*.\nThough one may sacrifice to Heaven beforehand,\nThey will surely fall into ruin afterward.\nThus, in villages, the elderly are respected by seniority,\nAnd in the court, rank determines precedence.\n\nThe exalted are honored because they are near the ruler,\nThe elderly are revered because they are near kin,\nThe aged are respected because they are near brothers.\nThose born noble become arrogant,\nThose born rich become extravagant.\nThus, without reflecting on the **Dao/Way** through noble status and wealth,\nFew can avoid wrongdoing.\n\nTo study without satiety is to govern oneself,\nTo teach without weariness is to govern the people.\nWith worthy teachers and good friends,\nFew will abandon virtue and do wrong.\n\nTo know the worthy is wisdom,\nTo love the worthy is benevolence,\nTo honor the worthy is righteousness,\nTo respect the worthy is rites,\nTo delight in the worthy is music.\n\nThe ancient masters who governed the world well\nwere those who acted without action yet accomplished all things.\nThus, in governing the world, they embraced inclusiveness—\nto obtain this inclusiveness was to act without action and achieve success,\nto fail in it was to move and bring misfortune.\n\nTo embrace inclusiveness for the world means:\n*\"With humility, as one crossing a great river in winter,\nCautiously, as one fearing injury from all sides,\nReverently, as one holding oneself in check,\nDissolving, as ice melting,\nSincerely, as uncarved wood,\nMuddled, as turbid water,\nVast, as a valley.\"*\n\nTo act with humility, as one crossing a great river in winter—\none dares not advance.\nTo act cautiously, as one fearing injury from all sides—\none fears harm from all directions.\nTo act reverently, as one holding oneself in check—\none is humble, respectful, and dignified.\nTo act dissolving, as ice melting—\none dares not hoard or accumulate.\nTo act sincerely, as uncarved wood—\none dares not carve or perfect.\nTo act muddled, as turbid water—\none dares not seek clarity or purity.\nTo act vast, as a valley—\none dares not overflow or be full.\n\nOne who dares not advance retreats and does not presume to lead.\nOne who fears harm guards softness and weakness and does not dare to boast.\nOne who is humble and respectful lowers oneself to honor others.\nOne who does not hoard diminishes himself and yet remains steadfast.\nOne who does not carve or perfect lacks completeness yet remains whole.\nOne who does not seek clarity endures filth and humiliation without striving for purity.\nOne who does not overflow, seeing insufficiency, does not dare to exalt himself.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is thus:\nRetreat, yet it leads;\nGuard softness and weakness, yet it endures;\nLower oneself, yet it elevates others;\nDiminish and decay, yet it remains firm;\nLack completeness, yet it is whole;\nEndure filth and humiliation, yet it remains fresh;\nSee insufficiency, yet it becomes worthy.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** acts without action yet accomplishes all things.\n\n「Laozi says: For all who study the **Dao/Way**, if they can clarify the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasp the essence of governance and disorder, and purify their heart and mind to preserve it, then seeing its beginning and end and returning to its emptiness and nothingness, this may be called attaining.\n\nThe root of governance is **virtue/power (仁義)**, and its branches are laws and institutions (**法度**). What gives rise to humanity is the root, and what does not is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet they have two loves: this is human nature. To prioritize the root over the branch is called a **gentleman/junzi (君子)**, to prioritize the branch over the root is called a **petty person/xiao ren (小人)**. When laws arise, they are to assist **virtue/power (仁義)**; if one values laws over **virtue/power**, it is like cherishing one’s cap and shoes while neglecting one’s head and feet. To value **virtue/power (仁義)** is to broaden and exalt it; if one does not increase its depth while only expanding its breadth, it will be ruined. If one does not widen its foundation while only increasing its height, it will collapse. Therefore, one should not magnify the beams of the roof without being able to bear the weight, nor should one bear the weight of the state without **virtue/power (德)**.\n\nThe ruler’s possession of the people is like the foundation of a city, the roots of a tree. Deep roots mean a firm foundation, and a thick base means stability above. Therefore, governance that does not rest upon **virtue/power (道德)** cannot be called enduring, and words that do not align with the ancient kings cannot be called the **Dao/Way**. To simply quote and collect the words of others, adopting one method to govern all affairs, is not the universal **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi says: The **Dao/Way** of governing people is like **Zhaofu (造父)** guiding his four horses: he harmonizes and unites their reins and bits, aligns their posture with his chest, attains accord within his own heart, and matches it with the will of the horses. Thus, he can take the **Dao/Way** and reach distant places, with his **qi (氣力)** in abundance. In advancing or retreating, turning or bending, all is as he intends—truly mastering the art! Now, **authority and influence (權勢)** are the ruler’s carriage, and great ministers are the ruler’s four horses. The ruler’s body cannot be separated from the carriage’s stability, nor his hands from the hearts of the four horses. Thus, if the four horses are not attuned, **Zhaofu (造父)** cannot take the **Dao/Way**; if the ruler and ministers are not in harmony, even the **sage (聖人)** cannot govern.\n\nTo wield the **Dao/Way** in guiding them, even a mediocre talent can suffice. To clarify distinctions and demonstrate them, even the wicked can be restrained. When things arrive, observe their changes; when matters arise, respond to their transformations. If the near are not disordered, then the far are governed. Without relying on improvised teachings, one attains the **Dao/Way** of nature, and thus all undertakings will not fail.\n\nLaozi says: For all who practice the **Dao/Way**, block the **Dao/Way** of evil, prevent what has not yet occurred, and do not value their own righteousness, but value what cannot be made wrong. Therefore, it is said: *\"Do not allow what is desirable to arise, lest it be sought daily; do not allow what is susceptible to being taken, lest it be contested daily.\"* Thus, human desires will be released, and the **public Dao/Way (公道)** will prevail.\n\nThose with excess follow the measure (**度**), and those lacking are brought up to it (**用**). Thus, the world can be unified. To abandon one’s duties while listening to praise or blame, to forsake merit and labor while relying on factions and cliques—this is why even those with extraordinary talents stagnate in their posts, why ministers of merit contend in court, and why the common people are disordered in the state. Therefore, there is the **Dao/Way** to govern people, but without the **Dao/Way**, one is governed by others.\n\nLaozi says: In governing the state, there are constants, but benefiting the people is the root. In politics and teachings, there is the **Dao/Way**, but current practice should follow antiquity. If it benefits the people, it need not strictly adhere to the ancients; if it addresses the affairs at hand, it need not blindly follow custom. Therefore, the **sage (聖人)** adjusts laws with the times, transforms rites with the people, and makes clothing, instruments, and tools each suitable for their use. Laws and institutions are each adapted to their proper function. Thus, altering the ancients is not necessarily wrong, nor does blindly following custom suffice.\n\nTo recite the books of the ancient kings is not as good as hearing their words; to hear their words is not as good as understanding their intent. Those who understand their intent cannot be fully expressed in words. Therefore, *\"The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* The **Dao/Way** by which the **sage (聖人)** acts is like gold and stone: once refined, it cannot be altered. Affairs are like musical instruments: each must be tuned anew at their conclusion. Therefore, laws, institutions, rites, and music are tools of governance, not the governance itself. Hence, rigid scholars cannot be entrusted to discuss the ultimate **Dao/Way**; they are bound by custom and constrained by doctrine.\n\nLaozi says: Is there truly a constant law in the world? It arises from human affairs, reflects human principles, conforms to Heaven and Earth, and delves into the spirits and gods. If one attains this, then governance can be properly ordered.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Three Sovereigns (三皇)** had no laws yet the people followed; the **Five Emperors (五帝)** had laws yet no punishments; the **Xia Dynasty (夏后氏)** did not break their word, the **Yin Dynasty (殷人)** swore oaths, and the **Zhou Dynasty (周人)** made alliances. In the decline of later ages, people endure filth yet scorn humiliation, covet gain yet lack shame. Therefore, laws and institutions are established to regulate the people’s customs and adjust urgency and leniency; tools and implements are adapted to the changes of the times and made suitable for their use.\n\nThose bound by laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those constrained by rites cannot be made to respond to changes. One must have singular insight and keen hearing to then be able to master the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly. To know the origin of laws, one must adapt to the times and change. To not know the source of governance, even if one follows it, one will still fall into disorder. Now, those who study the **Dao/Way** follow the ancients, cling to traditions, grasp texts and scriptures, and adhere to written laws, hoping to govern thereby. Without this, governance is impossible—like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, seeking suitability is difficult indeed.\n\nTo preserve safety and govern chaos, one must have wisdom. The **Dao/Way** must first be aligned with antiquity; even the foolish will have excess if they do this. Therefore, the **sage (聖人)** does not employ untested methods, nor does the enlightened ruler heed unverified words.\n\n**Wenzi (文子)** asked: *\"Where do laws originate?\"*\nLaozi said: *\"Laws arise from **virtue/power (義)**, and **virtue/power** arises from what is universally fitting. When what is universally fitting aligns with human hearts, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; they are born from human affairs and return to self-regulation. If one truly attains their root, they will not be disordered in their branches. If one knows their essence, they will not be confused by doubts. If they possess it within themselves, they will not deny it in others. If they do not possess it within themselves, they will not blame those who uphold it. Those who establish laws from below should not be overturned from above; what is forbidden among the people should not be practiced by the ruler himself. Therefore, when the ruler establishes laws, he must first take them as his own standard. Thus, restraint begins with oneself, and then the commands can be enforced upon the people.\"*\n\nThe law is the standard measure of the world and the ruler’s gauge of conduct. Those who set the law determine what is lawful and what is unlawful. Once the law is established, those who conform to it are rewarded, and those who deviate are punished. Even the noble and exalted are not lightly spared their rewards, nor are the lowly burdened with excessive penalties. Those who violate the law, even if they are virtuous, must be punished; those who conform to the measure, even if they are unworthy, are without fault. Thus, when justice prevails, harmony flourishes and discord is stifled.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people from acting at will. The establishment of rulers was to curb officials from acting unilaterally. Laws, measures, and methods were instituted to prevent the ruler from making arbitrary decisions.\n\nWhen no one acts at will, the Dao prevails and order is achieved. Thus, simplicity and non-action are embraced—not because they imply inaction, but because they arise from self-discipline.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: The skilled in rewards expend little yet inspire many; the skilled in punishments spare the use of force yet deter vice. The skilled in giving use frugality yet cultivate virtue; the skilled in taking amass much yet incur no resentment. Therefore, the sage governs by encouraging what the people favor and restraining what they abhor. Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world stands in awe. Thus, the greatest rewards are not extravagant, and the severest punishments are not indiscriminate. The sage governs with restraint yet achieves broad influence—this is the way.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: The way of the subject is to debate matters openly, to act first in service, to uphold duty and clarify distinctions, thereby establishing success. When ruler and subject follow different paths, order prevails; when they follow the same, chaos ensues. Each must fulfill their proper role, and all must occupy their rightful place—thus, the superior and inferior may govern one another.\n\nTherefore, branches must not exceed the trunk, nor extremities overpower the root—this is the balance of weight and measure, of great and small, in mutual restraint.\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet command much, guard few principles yet control broadly. A tree ten spans in girth supports a thousand-jun roof—this is the power of leverage. A five-inch hinge governs the opening and closing of doors—this is the power of position.\n\nOrders given from below must be obeyed: compliance brings benefit, defiance brings ruin. When the world follows without hesitation, it is because the commands align with the natural order. When decrees are issued and prohibitions enforced, it is because the multitude constitutes the force.\n\nJustice does not aim to benefit all under Heaven, yet if one is benefited, the world follows. Tyranny does not aim to harm all within the seas, yet if one is harmed, the world rebels. Thus, every action and decision must be carefully considered.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: To bend an inch is to straighten a foot; a small wrong yields a great right. The sage acts thus. Yet today, rulers judge their ministers by trifling deeds, overlook their grand achievements, and demand minor virtues—this is the path to losing true talent.\n\nThus, those with profound virtue are forgiven their minor faults; those with great reputation are overlooked for their small failings. Human nature inevitably has its flaws, but what matters is their overall conduct. Even if there are minor errors, they should not be held as burdens—what counts is their greater purpose. Neighborly virtue is not to be prized excessively.\n\nTherefore, excessive caution leads to failure, while those who are lax in conduct are shunned by the masses. Those who embody great principles have loose restraints; those who measure vast things earn distant renown. This is the way to judge ministers.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: From ancient times to now, no one has ever been flawless in conduct. Thus, the virtuous do not demand perfection from others. The square is not cut, the sharp is not notched, the straight is not reckless, the broad is not criticized. Moral excellence and martial prowess are not imposed upon others by force, but cultivated through the Dao. To blame others is easy; to cultivate oneself through the Dao is without fault.\n\nEven the *Xia* jade *huang* has its flaws, and the brightest pearl has its blemishes—yet the world treasures them, for minor defects do not mar their great beauty. Today, men fixate on others’ shortcomings, forget their virtues, and yet seek talent in the world—this is difficult indeed.\n\nThe common view focuses on lowly status, humble birth, and ignoble tasks, unaware of a person’s greater purpose. Thus, when judging a man, observe his actions when in power, his generosity when wealthy, his endurance when in poverty, his conduct when in disgrace. Examine his resolve in adversity to gauge his wisdom and courage, his demeanor in joy to test his integrity, his response to wealth to assess his benevolence, his reaction to fear to measure his self-control. Thus, human nature may be known.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: To bend is to seek extension; to be wronged is to seek rectitude. A small wrong yields a great right—the sage acts thus. A hundred rivers flow, yet only those that reach the sea are called valleys. Men pursue diverse paths, yet only those who return to the good are called sages.\n\nWise speech must be practicable; wise action must embody benevolence and righteousness. The sage’s errors, like eclipses of the sun and moon, do not obscure their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act rashly, the courageous do not kill recklessly. They choose carefully and act according to ritual propriety, ensuring that their deeds are accomplished and their reputation secure. Though they possess intelligence and ability, they must root themselves in benevolence and righteousness before standing firm. Intelligence and ability must align with the Dao; the sage uses benevolence and righteousness as the standard. Those who conform are called *junzi*; those who do not are called *xiaoren*.\n\nThe *junzi*, though they die, leave their name undimmed; the *xiaoren*, though they gain power, cannot escape their guilt.\n\nTo hold the map of the world in one hand and slit one’s own throat with the other—even the foolish would not do such a thing. For life is more precious than the world.\n\nTo die for one’s lord and parents is to regard death as returning home—for righteousness is heavier than life itself. Thus, the greatest benefits of the world, when compared to life, are small; yet life, when weighed against righteousness, is light. This is the measure of those who take benevolence and righteousness as their standard.\n\nLaozi said: The completeness of *Dao* and *virtue* is like the sun and moon—barbarians and uncivilized tribes cannot alter their course. Those who follow or reject it alike face praise or blame by convention; those whose intentions and actions are balanced find prosperity or adversity by fortune. When their affairs are thorough in the world, their achievements are fulfilled; when their endeavors align with the times, their names are established.\n\nThus, those who seek to establish功名 simplify their dealings with the world but are meticulous with the times. When the moment arrives, they act without hesitation.\n\nThe ancient warriors did not covet land or riches, but sought to preserve life and pacify chaos, removing harm from the people. Those greedy for gain and excessive in desire ravage the world, causing unrest among the ten thousand households, leaving none at peace in their homes.\n\nWhen a sage arises, they suppress the strong and violent, pacify the turbulent age, and remove harm from the world—transforming filth into purity, danger into security. Thus, they must act decisively.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor raged like fire, so the Yellow Emperor subdued him; Gōnggōng caused water calamities, so Zhuanxu executed him.\n\nTo teach the *Dao* and guide with *virtue*, yet if they do not listen, then one must confront them with awe and might. If they still do not comply, then one must use arms.\n\nTo kill the innocent and nourish the unrighteous is the greatest harm; to gather the world’s wealth for one’s own desires is the deepest calamity; to indulge one’s own desires while prolonging the suffering of the land—this is what the natural order rejects.\n\nThe reason for establishing rulers is to restrain violence and chaos. Now, seizing the strength of the people only to become tyrants—how can this not be eliminated?\n\nThose who raise fish must remove the *biānshì* (mudfish), those who raise birds and beasts must eliminate the wolves and jackals—how much more so for governing the people!\n\nThus, the origin of arms.\n\nLaozi said: The *Dao* of governing a state is this—no harsh decrees from above, no burdensome administration in office, no deceitful conduct among scholars, no excessive craftsmanship among artisans. Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance, their tools complete without ornamentation.\n\nIn turbulent times, it is otherwise: those who practice conduct vie to outdo each other in arrogance, those who uphold ritual compete in falsehood. Carriages are extravagantly carved, utensils elaborately inlaid. Those seeking wealth hoard rare treasures as precious, while those criticizing culture pursue frivolous complications as urgent. Matters are debated with sophistry, delayed endlessly without resolution—harmful to governance, beneficial only to chaos. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete, yet they serve no practical purpose.\n\nThus, the *Dao* of Shennong stated: If men of prime do not till the fields, there will be those who starve; if women of their years do not weave, there will be those who freeze. Therefore, the ruler himself plows, his wife weaves, setting an example for the world. In guiding the people, he does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods nor value useless objects.\n\nThus, the plowmen do not strain, for they have enough to sustain life; the weavers do not toil excessively, for they have enough to clothe their bodies. With neither surplus nor deficiency, each attends to their own needs. Clothing and food are abundant, and deceit does not arise. Peaceful and content, the world is harmonious. The wise have no schemes to employ, the brave no valor to display.\n\nLaozi said: The *Dao* of the hegemonic king is this—planned with strategy, mapped with tactics, moved with righteousness, not for mere survival, but to preserve or perish.\n\nThus, when hearing of a ruler oppressing his people, one raises an army to their borders, accusing them of unrighteousness and reproaching their misdeeds.\n\nUpon reaching the outskirts, the general is ordered: Do not cut down trees, do not dig up graves, do not destroy crops, do not burn stores, do not capture civilians, do not seize livestock. Then, the proclamation is issued: The ruler of that land defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, judges unfairly, executes the innocent. Heaven condemns him, the people seek vengeance. The army comes to abolish unrighteousness and enthrone the virtuous. Any who dare defy the *Dao*, disturbing the people, shall be exterminated—root and branch. Those who surrender their families shall be rewarded with their families; those who surrender their neighborhoods shall be rewarded with their neighborhoods; those who surrender their districts shall be ennobled with their districts; those who surrender their counties shall be made lords of their counties.\n\nConquer the state without harming its people. Depose the tyrant, reform the governance, honor the talented, exalt the virtuous, aid the orphans and widows, relieve the poor, release the imprisoned, reward the meritorious. The common folk open their doors to welcome them, offering rice gruel as provisions, fearing they will not come.\n\nA righteous army reaches the border and halts without battle; an unrighteous army arrives with heaps of corpses and rivers of blood, clashing in endless conflict.\n\nThus, those who fight for territory cannot achieve kingship; those who act for self-gain cannot establish their功. Those who undertake deeds for others are aided by the multitude; those who act for themselves are abandoned. Where the multitude moves, even the weak become strong; where the multitude withdraws, even the mighty perish.\n\nLaozi said: The highest ruler governs the state, orders the realm within, practices benevolence and righteousness, spreads virtue and bestows favors, establishes just laws, and blocks wicked paths. Ministers and officials are loyal, the people are harmonious, and all are of one heart. Ministers unite in effort, vassals submit to his authority, and the four quarters revere his virtue. Rectifying the ancestral temple within, he resolves conflicts a thousand *li* beyond. His commands resonate across the land—this is the highest.\n\nNext, there are those with vast lands and numerous people, a wise ruler and capable generals, wealth and strong arms, reliable discipline, and clear orders. When facing equal enemies, before blades are drawn, the foe flees in disarray—this is the middle way.\n\nOthers know the suitability of the land, master the advantages of terrain, discern the shifts of oppressive governance, and understand military formations. Where blades clash and arrows fly, they bear the wounded and gather the slain, with blood staining the earth a thousand *li*—this is the lowest path of arms.\n\nThe victory or defeat of armies lies in governance. If governance prevails over the people, the lower will follow the higher, and the army grows strong. If the people overcome governance, the lower will rebel against the higher, and the army grows weak.\n\nThe virtue sufficient to embrace all under Heaven’s people,\nthe undertakings sufficient to meet all under Heaven’s crises,\nthe selection and appointment sufficient to win the hearts of worthy scholars,\nthe counsel and deliberation sufficient to weigh the balance of power—\nthis is the Dao of the highest virtue.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"The reason a state grows strong is that its people are willing to die for it.\nThe reason they are willing to die is virtue.\nThe reason virtue prevails is authority.\nThus, one governs with culture and unifies with force—\nthis is called inevitable victory.\nWhen authority and virtue march together, this is called inevitable strength.\"*\n\nWhen blades clash and arrows fall like rain,\nand warriors vie for glory,\nit is because rewards are trusted and punishments are clear.\n\nWhen the ruler regards his people as sons,\nthe people serve him as fathers,\nwhen the ruler regards his people as brothers,\nthe people serve him as elder brothers,\nwhen the ruler regards his people as sons,\nhe will surely reign over the four seas;\nwhen the people serve him as fathers,\nhe will surely govern all under Heaven;\nwhen the ruler regards his people as brothers,\nthey will surely die for him in difficulty;\nwhen the people serve him as elder brothers,\nthey will surely die for him in flight.\nThus, the enmity of fathers and brothers\ncannot be fought.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous ruler\nrefines his governance within to accumulate his virtue,\nblocks out deceit without to clarify his might,\nobserves their toil and ease to know their hunger and fullness,\nsets fixed battle terms,\nviews death as returning home—\nfor this is the extension of his grace.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: On Ritual (Shang Li)**\n\nThe Ancient Sage Laozi said:\n\nIn the age of the Primordial True Ones,\nthey breathed in harmony with yin and yang,\nand all living beings looked up to their virtue in reverence and accord.\nAt that time, their governance was subtle and profound,\ntheir nature pure and unadorned—\nbefore purity had yet dispersed,\nand all things thrived in great ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of Fu Xi,\nthe world grew dim and laborious,\nall seeking to abandon their childlike innocence,\nto awaken within the expanse of Heaven and Earth—\ntheir virtue became convoluted and fragmented.\n\nWhen it came to Shennong and the Yellow Emperor,\nthey took charge of the world,\nordered the four seasons,\nharmonized yin and yang—\nand thus all the people stood erect in contemplation,\nbowed their heads in listening,\nyet the governance remained unbalanced.\n\nDown to the Xia and Shang dynasties,\nlustful desires reached for all things,\ncleverness was seduced by externals,\nand life’s true nature was lost.\n\nBy the Zhou dynasty,\nthe pure was diluted, the genuine corrupted,\nthe Dao abandoned for artifice,\nvirtue twisted into deceit—\ncrafty intelligence sprouted,\nmonkeys mimicked sages,\nornate falsehoods coerced the masses,\npolished poetry and scriptures were peddled for fame,\neach striving to impose their clever deceits,\nto fit into the world—\nand thus the Great Origin was lost.\nHence, the decline of nature and life has endured for ages.\n\nTherefore, the study of the Perfect Ones\nseeks to return nature to its void,\nto wander the mind in emptiness—\nwhile the world’s scholars\nstrive to refine virtue and constrain nature,\nagitate the five viscera,\nforce action beyond knowledge,\nto clamor for renown—\nthis is what the Perfect Ones do not do.\n\nTo refine virtue is to reveal oneself,\nto constrain nature is to sever life—\nyet the Perfect Ones settle their minds on death and life,\npenetrate the logic of honor and disgrace—\nwhen the world praises them, they are not further encouraged,\nwhen the world condemns them, they are not further deterred—\nfor they have grasped the essence of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings\ndrew their symbols from Heaven above,\nmeasured their standards from Earth below,\ntook their laws from human nature,\nharmonized the qi of yin and yang,\nbalanced the rhythms of the four seasons,\nobserved the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—\nhigh and low, fertile and barren—\nto establish governance and produce wealth,\nto alleviate hunger and cold,\nto ward off sickness and misfortune.\nThey received the affairs of humanity,\nestablished ritual and music,\npracticed the Way of benevolence and righteousness,\nto order human relationships.\n\nThey arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth,\nto establish the bonds of father and son and form the family;\nthey listened to the pure and impure tones of the five notes and the six pitches,\nto establish the duties of ruler and subject and form the state;\nthey observed the sequence of early, middle, and late in the four seasons,\nto establish the order of seniority and juniority and form the offices.\nThey divided the land into regions,\npartitioned the states for governance,\nestablished the Grand Academy to teach them—\nthese were the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Dao was obtained, they acted;\nwhen the Dao was lost, they abandoned it.\nFor nothing ever remains stretched without slackening,\nflourishing without decline—\nonly the sage can flourish without decline.\n\nWhen the sage first created music,\nit was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness,\nto restore the mind to its natural state.\nBut when it declined,\nit flowed without return,\nindulged in lust and color,\nignored proper law—\nand this corruption spread to later ages,\nleading to the fall of states.\n\nWhen they composed scriptures,\nit was to govern all affairs,\nso the foolish would not forget,\nand the wise would record events.\nBut when it declined,\nthey used them for deceit,\nto exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent.\n\nWhen they established parks,\nit was to prepare for ancestral temples,\nto inspect soldiers and guard against emergencies.\nBut when it declined,\nthey hunted and fished to exhaust the people’s time,\nto drain their strength.\n\nWhen they honored the worthy,\nit was to level teaching and justice,\nto settle lawsuits—\nthe worthy in office, the capable in their posts,\nfavor flowing to the people,\nall embracing virtue.\nBut when it declined,\ncliques and factions formed,\neach advancing their own,\nabandoning the public for private gain,\ninner and outer factions colluding—\nthe deceitful in power, the worthy in hiding.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth:\nwhen pushed to extremes, it reverses;\nwhen overdone, it diminishes.\nThus, the sage governs by rectifying flaws and altering institutions,\nwhen matters conclude, they change their approach—\ntheir excellence lies in harmony,\ntheir failure in expedience.\n\nThe sage’s Way declares:\nWithout cultivating ritual and righteousness,\nshame and modesty cannot stand—\nif the people lack shame and modesty,\nthey cannot be governed.\nWithout knowing ritual and righteousness,\nlaws cannot be upheld—\nwithout elevating the good and abandoning the base,\nthere is no turning toward ritual and righteousness—\nwithout law, governance is impossible.\nWithout knowing ritual and righteousness,\nlaws cannot be enforced—\nlaws can punish the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\ncan execute thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.\n\nThe sage-king rules above,\nmaking good and evil clear to the people,\nusing praise and blame to guide them,\nhonoring the worthy and advancing them,\ndegrading the unworthy and removing them,\nso that punishments are rarely used,\nwhile ritual and virtue are cultivated,\nand the virtuous are entrusted with governance.\n\nThus, the highest in the realm is made the **Three Ministers**,\nthe highest in a province the **Nine Ministers**,\nthe highest in a state the **Twenty-Seven Great Officers**,\nand the highest in a village the **Eighty-One Elemental Worthies**.\n\nOne who surpasses ten thousand in wisdom is called **Heroic**,\none who surpasses a thousand is called **Outstanding**,\none who surpasses a hundred is called **Exceptional**,\nand one who surpasses ten is called **Vigorous**.\n\nTo understand the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth,\nto grasp the principles of human nature,\nto be vast enough to embrace all,\nto be benevolent enough to win the distant,\nto be wise enough to discern expedience—\nthis is the **Heroic** one.\n\nTo possess virtue enough to teach and transform,\nconduct that embodies principle,\ntrustworthiness to gain the people’s support,\nclarity to illuminate those below—\nthis is the **Outstanding** one.\n\nTo have conduct worthy of emulation,\nwisdom to resolve doubts,\ntrust to uphold agreements,\nintegrity to distribute wealth fairly,\nactions that serve as models,\nwords that align with the **Way**—\nthis is the **Exceptional** one.\n\nTo fulfill one’s duties without neglect,\nto uphold principle without collusion,\nto face danger without cowardice,\nto reject gain without greed—\nthis is the **Vigorous** one.\n\n**Heroic, Outstanding, Exceptional, and Vigorous**—\neach is placed according to their greatness or smallness,\nfrom root to branch,\ngoverning the light with the heavy,\nthe ruler leading and the people harmonizing,\nso that all under Heaven unite in one heart,\nturning away from greed and toward **virtue**,\ntransforming the people as wind moves grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy rule over the worthy,\neven severe punishments cannot restrain their deceit,\nthe weak cannot control the strong,\nthe small cannot command the great—\nthis is the nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, the sage selects the worthy to establish merit,\nwhile the unworthy ruler elevates those like himself.\nBy observing whom they elevate,\none can distinguish order from chaos;\nby examining their factions,\none can judge virtue from depravity.\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*\"Those who institute ritual carve and polish human nature,\nstraightening and restraining its spontaneity.\nThough the eyes desire, they are forbidden by measure;\nthough the heart delights, they are restrained by ritual.\nTheir movements are constrained, their bows and curtsies exaggerated—\ntheir flesh stiffens as if starving,\ntheir wine is poured out but not drunk.\nExternally, their bodies are bound;\ninternally, their **virtue** is tormented.\nThey suppress the harmony of yin and yang,\nforcing the natural flow of life—\nthus, they spend their lives as sorrowful beings.\nWhy?\nThey do not root out the source of desire,\nyet forbid what is desired;\nthey do not explore the origin of joy,\nyet prevent what brings joy.\nThis is like caging a beast without blocking its enclosure,\nforbidding its wild impulses,\nor damning a river’s flow while trying to stop it with one’s hands.\nThus it is said:\n*Open its floodgates,\nlet the waters flow—\nyet the damage is already done.*\n\nRitual does not make people cease desiring,\nbut restrains them;\nmusic does not make people cease rejoicing,\nbut regulates them.\nIf the world fears punishment and does not dare steal,\nis it not better to make them lack the impulse to steal?\nThus, if one knows its true purpose,\neven the greedy will decline it;\nif one does not know its purpose,\neven the virtuous cannot refuse it.\n\nThose who lose their states,\ndie by others’ hands,\nand become the world’s ridicule—\nthey have never lacked desire.\nThey know winter fans and summer furs are useless to them,\nyet all things turn to dust and filth!\nThus, to stop boiling by skimming foam\nonly makes it worse—\none must remove the fire at its source.\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*To act in accordance with nature is the **Dao**,\nto realize one’s true nature is **virtue**.\nOnly when nature is lost does one value **virtue**,\nbut when **virtue** is established, **Dao** is abandoned.\nWhen purity is scattered, ritual and music become adornment;\nwhen right and wrong are defined, the people are confused;\nwhen jade and pearls are prized, the world competes for them.\n\nRitual is what distinguishes noble from base,\n**virtue** is what harmonizes the relationships of ruler and subject,\nfather and son, brothers, husband and wife.\nIn the degenerate age, ritual becomes mere etiquette,\nand **virtue** is practiced for gain—\nrulers and subjects criticize each other,\nkin harbor grudges.\nThus, stagnant water breeds cannibalistic creatures,\ndecaying earth spawns self-devouring beasts,\nand elaborate ritual and music give rise to deceit.\n\nIn the degenerate age of governance,\nthey do not accumulate the means of sustenance,\nthey dilute the world’s purity,\nscatter its simplicity,\nconfuse the common people,\ncalling clarity filth,\nwhile **virtue** and life scatter in chaos.\nFaith and integrity decay,\npeople lose their nature,\nlaws contradict **virtue**,\nconduct opposes profit,\nthe rich and poor undermine each other,\nand the ruler and his servants are beyond comparison.\n\nWhen there is excess, one should yield;\nwhen there is lack, one should contend.\nYielding gives rise to ritual and **virtue**,\ncontention spawns violence and disorder.\nThus, excessive desire leads to unchecked actions,\nand seeking abundance fuels endless strife.\nIn an orderly age, the petty uphold propriety,\nand profit cannot tempt them;\nin chaos, the virtuous become deceitful,\nand laws cannot restrain them.\n\n**Laozi** says:\n*The rulers of decaying times*\ndrill into mountains for stone,\npluck gold and jade,\ndig for pearls and shells,\nmelt copper and iron—\nyet all things wither.\nThey dissect fetuses, burn sacrifices,\noverturn nests, destroy eggs—\nphoenixes do not take flight,\nunicorns do not roam.\nThey build wooden towers,\nburn forests for hunting,\ndrain ponds for fishing,\npile earth into mounds for dwellings,\ndig wells to drink,\ndredge rivers to make pools,\nfortify cities as strongholds,\ncapture beasts for livestock—\nthus, yin and yang are disrupted,\nthe four seasons fall out of order,\nthunder and lightning are shattered,\nhail and frost bring ruin,\nten thousand things wither and die,\nhalf the people perish,\ngrasses and trees wither in summer,\nthe three great rivers run dry,\nmountains and valleys are partitioned,\npeople are counted and allotted,\nmachines and barriers are set as defenses,\nranks and titles are rigidly defined,\nthe aged, the wise, and the unworthy are rewarded and punished alike—\nthen wars arise, and resentment spreads.\nThe innocent are slaughtered,\nthe guilty are punished—\nand thus, chaos begins.\"*\n\n「Thus, Laozi says: When the world is about to lose its *nature* (性) and *life* (命), it is like the rise of the *yin* (阴) *qi* (氣). The ruler is shrouded in darkness and cannot see clearly, the Dao/Way is abandoned and does not flow, virtue/power is extinguished and does not shine forth. Actions are perverse against Heaven, decrees defy the four seasons, spring and autumn shrink their harmony, and the Earth and Sky strip away their virtue/power. The sovereign sits on his throne but is not at peace, the ministers withdraw in seclusion and do not speak, the officials follow the ruler’s whims and destroy the norms, estranging kin and seeking self-preservation. The wicked flatter while plotting in secret, and swiftly they load the arrogant lord with luxuries, mirroring his chaos to accomplish their schemes. Thus, the ruler and ministers grow estranged and unkind, kin are alienated and unfaithful, fields yield no crops, roads offer no respite, stored grain rots and walls crumble, tortoiseshells and jades are hollowed out, divination is practiced daily, yet the world remains fractured—one family does not suffice. The feudal lords impose laws and customs that diverge, uprooting the roots and abandoning the foundation. They carve the five punishments, sharpening them like blades, contending over the minutiae of law while slaughtering the common folk, taking half their lives. They raise armies to make war, assaulting cities with wanton slaughter, overturning the high and secure, deploying massive siege chariots, erecting towering ramparts, and clearing battlefields into death traps. They provoke fierce enemies, and when the people rise in rebellion, their reputation is but a fleeting pretense. They conquer lands and states, leaving heaps of corpses numbering tens of thousands, while the aged and weak perish from hunger and cold beyond count. From this point onward, the world has never truly found peace in its *nature* (性) and *life* (命), nor joy in its customs.\n\nThe worthy and sagely then arise in tumult, upholding virtue/power and Dao/Way, reinforcing benevolence and righteousness. They enlighten the near with wisdom and embrace the far with virtue/power, unifying the world so that generations succeed in aiding one another, dismissing slanderous flatterers and silencing baseless rumors. They abolish the harsh punishments, remove burdensome decrees, block idle gossip, and seal the gates of factionalism. They suppress cleverness, follow the great norms, topple superficial structures, and cast aside sharp minds. They open the path to great harmony and confusion, allowing all things to return to their original roots.\n\nThe sage does not create the times; when the times come, he does not fail to respond. Thus, he is never left without purpose. Laozi says: The depth of the *Ying* (酆) waters reaches ten *ren* (仞) yet it does not receive filth, for gold and jade lie within, their forms visible without—it is not that the waters are not deep and pure, but that fish, turtles, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there. On stone, no grains grow; on barren hills, no deer roam, for there is no shelter or shade. Therefore, governance marked by severity is mistaken for insight, ruthlessness for clarity, rigid cruelty for loyalty, and intricate schemes for merit. Such rule is like the vastest hide being stripped—it is the path of utter collapse. When governance is stifling, the people are simple; when governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\n\nLaozi says: Govern with virtue/power, wage war with the Dao/Way. First establish governance that cannot be overcome, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack the ungoverned with the disordered is like answering fire with fire or water with water—like cannot cure like, so the Dao/Way relies on difference for its efficacy. Calmness becomes the opposite of agitation, order the opposite of chaos, fullness the opposite of hunger, ease the opposite of toil, and uprightness the opposite of perversion. If these opposites correspond—like water and fire, metal and wood clashing against one another—where can one not prevail? Thus, when virtue/power is balanced, the many overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise subdue the foolish; and when wisdom is equal, those with strategy capture those without.»\n\n---\n*(Annotations preserved in brackets for *性* (nature/life-force) and *命* (fate/life), but otherwise omitted per guidelines.)*",

      "translated_text": "**The Comprehensive Classic of the Perfection of the Dao, *Wenzi* – Scroll One: The Origin of the Dao**\n\nLaozi said: “There is a thing formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. It is formless yet possesses image, profound and obscure, silent and desolate, faint and indistinct. I cannot hear its sound, so I force a name upon it and call it the *Dao*.”\n\nNow, the *Dao* is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond measure. It embraces Heaven and Earth, bestowing without form. Its source and flow surge ceaselessly, empty yet never full. When turbid, it slowly clarifies through stillness; its bounty is inexhaustible, unbound by time. Though it cannot be held in a single grasp, it contracts yet expands, conceals yet illuminates, softens yet hardens. It contains *yin* and exhales *yang*, revealing the three luminaries. Mountains rise by it, abysses deepen by it; beasts run by it, birds fly by it; the *lin* swims by it, the *feng* soars by it; the stars and constellations move by it. By loss it gains existence, by humility it attains honor, by retreat it takes the lead.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the *Dao* and stood at the center. Their spirits roamed with transformation, pacifying the four directions. Thus they could set Heaven in motion and Earth in stillness, turning the wheel without cease, flowing like water without end, beginning and ending with all things. Wind rises and clouds gather, thunder roars and rain falls—all respond without limit. Carved and polished, they return to simplicity.\n\nActing without action, they harmonized life and death; speaking without words, they penetrated virtue. Serene and unassuming, they attained harmony. Though myriad things differ, they all thrive by it. It harmonizes *yin* and *yang*, regulates the four seasons, balances the five phases, moistens grasses and trees, seeps into metal and stone. Beasts grow large, fur and feathers glisten; bird eggs do not spoil, animal fetuses do not miscarry. Fathers know no sorrow for lost sons, elder brothers no grief for dead younger brothers. Children are not orphaned, women are not widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not arise—all is the result of embodying virtue.\n\nThe great constant *Dao* gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. All things depend on it to live, yet none know its virtue; they depend on it to die, yet none can resent it. It stores and accumulates without growing richer, distributes and bestows without becoming poorer. Vague and indistinct, it cannot be depicted. Elusive yet ever-present, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds and transforms without form. Flowing and penetrating, it moves not in vain. It coils and unfurls with hardness and softness, bows and rises with *yin* and *yang*.\n\nLaozi said: “The great man is tranquil and thoughtless, serene and carefree. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, and *yin* and *yang* as his drivers. He travels where there are no roads, roams without weariness, departs through no gate. Taking Heaven as his canopy, nothing is left uncovered; taking Earth as his chariot, nothing is left uncarried. Taking the four seasons as his horses, nothing is left uncommanded; taking *yin* and *yang* as his drivers, nothing is left unprepared. Thus he moves swiftly without swaying, travels far without fatigue. His four limbs do not stir, his hearing and vision do not diminish, yet he illuminates all under Heaven—grasping the essence of the *Dao*, he observes the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world cannot be forced; one must follow their natural course and guide them. The changes of the myriad things cannot be controlled; one must hold to their essence and return them to it. Thus the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without. He sharpens his spirit and stills his knowledge and perceptions, so that in seeming inaction, nothing is left undone; in seeming non-governance, nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nWhat is called *non-action* is not acting before things do; *non-governance* is not altering the natural. *Nothing left ungoverned* means following the mutual arising of things.”\n\nLaozi said: “He who grasps the *Dao* to govern the people responds to events as they come and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their answer; the changes of a hundred affairs all find their match. Thus the *Dao* is emptiness and nothingness, levelness and ease, clarity and stillness, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity—these five are the forms and images of the *Dao*.\n\nEmptiness is the dwelling of the *Dao*; levelness is its essence; clarity and stillness are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function. Reversion is the constant of the *Dao*; softness is its hardness; weakness is its strength. Purity and simplicity are its trunk.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. When desires and cravings do not burden, emptiness reaches its utmost. When likes and dislikes are absent, levelness reaches its utmost. When unified and unchanging, stillness reaches its utmost. When unmingled with things, purity reaches its utmost. When neither sorrowful nor joyful, virtue reaches its utmost.\n\nThe governance of the perfected man discards cleverness and erases ornamentation. He relies on the *Dao* and abandons wisdom, emerging with the people from the public realm. He restricts what he holds, reduces what he seeks, removes enticements and longings, eliminates pride and desire, and casts aside thoughts and worries. Restricting what he holds brings clarity; reducing what he seeks brings attainment. Thus, by mastering the inner, he governs the outer, and nothing is left undone. Mastery of the inner allows him to shepherd the outer. When the inner is mastered, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are balanced, sinews and bones are strong, hearing and vision are keen.\n\nThe great *Dao* is smooth and broad, not far from the self. Those who seek it afar go forth only to return.”\n\nLaozi said: “The sage forgets about governing others and attends to self-cultivation. He values not power and position but self-attainment; when he attains the self, the world attains him. He delights not in wealth and honor but in harmony. Knowing the greatness of the self and the smallness of the world, he nears the *Dao*.\n\nThus it is said: ‘Utmost emptiness, steadfast stillness—while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.’ The *Dao* shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form. Silent and unmoving, it is vast and profoundly obscure, so broad and great that nothing lies beyond it, so minute that it cannot be divided within. Without walls or enclosure, it gives birth between being and non-being.”",

      "translated_text": "The true person embodies emptiness and non-being, simplicity and ease, purity and stillness, softness and weakness, unadulterated plainness—unmixed with external things. Such is the virtue of Heaven and Earth’s *Dao*, and thus they are called true persons. The true person holds the self great and the world small, values the cultivation of the body and disdains the governance of others. They do not allow things to disturb their harmony, nor desires to disorder their emotions. They conceal their name and identity: when the *Dao* prevails, they remain hidden; when it does not, they appear. They practice non-doing, engage in non-affairs, know non-knowing. They embrace the Heavenly *Dao*, encompass the heart of Heaven, inhale and exhale yin and yang, exhale the old and inhale the new. With yin they close, with yang they open; with hardness and softness they coil and stretch; with yin and yang they bow and rise. Their heart aligns with Heaven, their body unites with the *Dao*. They feel no joy, no suffering, no delight, no anger. The myriad things are mystically one, without right or wrong.\n\nWhen the body is harmed by the ravages of cold, heat, dryness, or dampness, the form decays and the spirit is cut off. When the spirit is injured by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, or worry, the spirit is exhausted while the form remains. Thus, the true person employs the heart, leans on nature, and relies on the spirit, supporting one another to attain completion. Therefore, their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.\n\nConfucius asked about the *Dao*. Laozi said: “Correct your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of Heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will become your countenance, and the *Dao* will be your abode. Your pupils will be like a newborn calf, seeking nothing of the past. Your form will be like withered wood, your heart like dead ashes. Truly, you will know the real without clinging to partial reasons. Vast and unbounded, without a heart to scheme—‘lucid in all four directions, can you remain without knowledge?’”\n\nLaozi said: “Those who attend to life respond to change and act, for change arises with the times, following no constant course. Thus, ‘The *Dao* that can be spoken is not the eternal *Dao*; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.’ Writing arises from words, and words emerge from knowledge. Yet the wise do not know—this is not the eternal *Dao*. The name that can be named is not that of the one who treasures the hidden. ‘To hear much is to reach exhaustion; better to guard the center.’ ‘Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow.’ ‘Abandon sagacity and discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.’\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this harms their nature. When things arrive and one responds, knowledge is set in motion. When knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. When likes and dislikes take form, knowledge is enticed outward and cannot return to the self, and Heavenly principle is extinguished. Therefore, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man, externally transforming with things while inwardly remaining free of emotion. Thus, those who penetrate the *Dao* return to purity and stillness; those who empty themselves of things conclude in non-doing. With tranquility they nurture knowledge, with indifference they harmonize with the spirit, reaching the boundless. Following Heaven, they wander with the *Dao*; following man, they mingle with the vulgar. Therefore, the sage does not allow affairs to disturb Heaven, nor desires to disorder emotions. Without scheming, they are fitting; without speaking, they are trusted; without pondering, they obtain; without acting, they accomplish. Thus, though they dwell above, the people do not find them burdensome; though they stand before others, none are harmed. The world turns to them, and the treacherous and perverse fear them. Because they do not contend with the myriad things, none dare contend with them.”\n\nLaozi said: “When people follow desires, they lose their nature, and their movements are never correct. With this, to govern a state is to bring chaos; to cultivate the self is to invite defilement. Those who have not heard the *Dao* cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain purity. Human nature is originally without depravity or filth. Long immersed in things, it changes; changing and forgetting its root, it merges with what seems like its nature. Water’s nature desires clarity, yet sand and stone defile it. Human nature desires equilibrium, yet cravings and desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self.\n\nThus, the sage does not use knowledge to enslave things, nor desires to disturb harmony. Their joy is not exuberant, their sorrow not mournful. Therefore, they stand high without peril, rest secure without toppling. To hear good words and clever plans, even the foolish know to delight in them; to praise sagely virtue and lofty conduct, even the unworthy know to admire them. Those who speak of such things are many, but those who employ them are few; those who admire them are numerous, but those who practice them are scarce. The reason for this is being shackled by things and bound by custom.\n\nThus it is said: ‘I practice non-doing, and the people transform themselves. I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves. I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves. I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’ Purity and stillness are the utmost of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the *Dao*. The formless is vast, the formed is small; the formless is much, the formed is little; the formless is strong, the formed is weak; the formless is solid, the formed is hollow. The formed brings affairs to completion; the formless initiates beginnings. Completion produces vessels; beginnings preserve simplicity. The formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed arises from the formless—thus, the formless is the beginning of the formed.\n\nBroad and thick things have names—those with names are prized for wholeness. Meager and thin things have no names—those without names are base and light. Abundance and wealth have names—those with names are honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity have no names—those without names are lowly and weak. The male and potent have names—those with names are illustrious and bright. The female and yielding have no names—those without names are subtle and restrained. Surplus has names—those with names are exalted and wise. Deficiency has no names—those without names are assigned to lowly tasks. Merit produces names; lack of merit produces no names. Names arise from the nameless—the nameless is the mother of names. The *Dao* of Heaven generates being from non-being, completes the difficult through the easy. Therefore, the sage holds to the *Dao*, employing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and wonder to perfect virtue. Thus, with the *Dao* there is virtue; with virtue there is merit; with merit there is name; with name there is a return to the *Dao*. Merit and name endure long, and one remains free of blame throughout life. Kings and dukes have merit and name; the orphaned and widowed have no merit and name. Thus, the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to the root.”",

      "translated_text": "The accomplished does not claim possession, thus merit becomes benefit, and namelessness becomes function.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and unknowing, unaware of east or west. Their appearance did not depart from their nature, their words did not exceed their actions, their conduct required no adornment, and their speech was unembellished. Their clothing was plain, and those whose spiritual virtue was not fully embodied in themselves—how could distant forces corrupt them? Those who had forgotten the desire to harm within—even a starving tiger could be tailed by them, let alone other men.\n\nThose who embody the *Dao* find ease without exhaustion; those who rely on calculation labor without achievement. To govern by harsh laws and punishments is not the work of true kings and emperors. Frequent use of the whip and rod is not the way to guide far-reaching governance. Excessive likes and dislikes invite misfortune to follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not created by them but inherited; their prohibitions and punishments were not enacted by them but upheld. Therefore, those who can inherit achieve greatness, while those who create achieve only the petty. Those who can uphold endure, while those who act invite failure.\n\nThose who rely on ears and eyes to listen and see exhaust the mind yet remain unclear. Those who govern by cunning and calculation strain the mind yet achieve nothing. Relying on the talents of one person is insufficient for perfect governance; the abilities of one person cannot cultivate even three acres.\n\nFollowing the principles of the *Dao* and aligning with the natural order of Heaven and Earth, even the Six Directions are not beyond equalization. Ears misled by praise and blame, eyes seduced by beauties—ritual and propriety are insufficient to restrain love, but sincerity of heart can embrace what is distant. Thus, nothing is more bitter than the will, yet the sword is but a lesser weapon; nothing is greater than yin and yang, yet drums and war horns are but trifles. The greatest bandits leave no trace of restraint in their slaughter; middle bandits hide in the mountains; petty bandits lurk among the people.\n\nThus it is said: When the people abound in cleverness and skill, strange things proliferate; when laws and decrees multiply, thieves and robbers increase. Shifting from this to that, natural calamities do not arise.\n\nTherefore, governing a state with cunning is the state’s ruin; governing a state without cunning is the state’s virtue. Joy is the ancestor of the myriad things. When these three—cunning, calculation, and contrivance—are practiced, one sinks into formlessness.\n\nFormlessness is called *oneness*; oneness is the mind’s harmony with all under Heaven. Virtue is spread without overflow, employed without strain. It is seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. From formlessness, forms arise; from soundlessness, the five tones resound; from tastelessness, the five flavors take shape; from colorlessness, the five colors emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and fullness from emptiness.\n\nThe number of tones does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five tones are beyond hearing. The number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors are beyond tasting. The number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors are beyond seeing. When the *gong* tone is established, the five tones take shape; when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; when whiteness is established, the five colors are complete; when the *Dao* is established, the myriad things are born.\n\nThus, the principle of *oneness* extends throughout the Four Seas; its blessing pervades Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is thick and uncarved like wood; in its dispersion, it is vast and turbid like muddy water. Turbid, it gradually clears; empty, it gradually fills. Vast and tranquil like the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly lost yet existing.\n\n*Laozi* said: The sum of the myriad things all passes through a single opening; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage follows a single standard, does not alter the ancient ways, and does not change the constant principles. They model themselves on the level and follow the plumb line, bending to accommodate the constant.\n\nJoy and anger are deviations from the *Dao*; sorrow and grief are losses of virtue; likes and dislikes are excesses of the mind; desires and cravings are burdens of life. Great anger harms *yin*; great joy harms *yang*. Weak *qi* causes muteness; terror induces madness. Sorrow and grief scorch the heart, and illness accumulates. If one can eliminate these five, they align with the divine luminaries.\n\nThe divine luminaries reside within; those who attain the within find their five viscera at peace, their thoughts calm, their ears and eyes keen, their sinews and bones strong. They are open and unobstructed without confusion, firm and unyielding without depletion. They neither exceed nor fall short.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the *Dao*. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable, its length infinite, its reach without limit. Its ebb and flow, its increase and decrease, surpass all calculation. Above, it becomes rain and dew; below, it moistens the earth. The myriad things cannot but live; the hundred affairs cannot but succeed. It embraces all life without partiality, bestows blessings upon crawling creatures without seeking repayment. It enriches all under Heaven without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without cost. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not harmed; severed, it is not cut; burned, it is not scorched. Soft and yielding, it flows without dissipation. It penetrates metal and stone, overcomes all under Heaven. Whether in excess or deficiency, it allows all to take or give. It receives the myriad things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, in vast equality with Heaven and Earth. This is called *supreme virtue*.\n\nWater achieves its supreme virtue through its simplicity, softness, and smoothness. Thus it is said: *\"The softest under Heaven rides the hardest under Heaven, entering where there is no gap.\"* Formlessness is the great ancestor of things; soundlessness is the great progenitor of categories. The *True Person* communicates with the numinous storehouse, becoming one with the Creator. Holding the *Mysterious Virtue* in the heart, their transformations are swift as spirit.\n\nThus, the *Dao* beyond *Dao* is vast and boundless. Before commands are issued, customs are already transformed—this is the power of the mind’s conduct. The myriad things have their origins, yet alone return to their root; the hundred affairs have their sources, yet alone guard their gate. Thus, they can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without dazzling, respond to echoes without knowing.\n\n*Laozi* said: Those who attain the *Dao* have weak aspirations yet accomplish great deeds; their minds are empty yet their responses are fitting.",
      "overlap_context": "rough the easy. Therefore, the sage holds to the *Dao*, employing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and wonder to perfect virtue. Thus, with the *Dao* there is virtue; with virtue there is merit; with merit there is name; with name there is a return to the *Dao*. Merit and name endure long, and one remains free of blame throughout life. Kings and dukes have merit and name; the orphaned and widowed have no merit and name. Thus, the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to the root.”",

      "translated_text": "The one with weak aspirations is gentle, soft, tranquil, and serene, concealing themselves in non-acquisition, acting in incapacity. Serene and non-doing, their movements never miss their moment. Thus, \"the noble must take the humble as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation.\" Sheltering the small to embrace the great, residing within to govern without, acting with softness yet possessing hardness, their strength overcomes all enemies, none can surpass them. They respond to transformations and measure the times, so none can harm them. Those who desire hardness must guard it with softness; those who desire strength must preserve it with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes hardness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what they accumulate, and you will know survival or demise. Hardness overcomes those weaker than oneself, yet when it encounters its equal, it is checked. Softness overcomes those stronger than oneself, its power immeasurable. Thus, \"when weapons are strong, they perish; when wood is strong, it breaks.\" Leather that is strong will split; teeth, though harder than the tongue, perish first. Therefore, \"the soft and weak are the stem of life, the hard and strong are the companions of death.\" The one who initiates is on the path to exhaustion; the one who follows attains the source of success.\n\nThose who grasp the Dao to pair with change—whether first or last, they control one another. How could they lose what controls others, and how could others control them? What is called \"following\" is adjusting to the measure and aligning with the time. When the time shifts, there is no gap for rest. To precede is to overreach; to follow is to fall short. The sun revolves, the moon cycles, time does not wait for man. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time, for time is hard to obtain yet easy to lose. Therefore, the sage acts in accordance with the time, establishes merit based on resources, upholds the pure Dao, adheres to the feminine principle, follows along to respond to change, always follows and never leads. Soft and weak in stillness, calm and composed in stability, even the greatest hardness cannot contend with them.\n\n*Laozi* said: When the heart harbors scheming, even purity is not unsullied. Their garments are warm yet without adornment; their weapons are blunt and without edges. They walk with hesitant steps, gaze with dim eyes, stand by the well to drink, till the fields to eat. They do not bestow, nor seek virtue. High and low do not vie; long and short do not compare. They follow the customs of the wind, adapt to the ease of affairs. Those who flaunt deceit to confuse the world, or act erratically to mislead the masses—the sage does not consider them part of the common way.\n\n**Chapter Two: Sincerity**\n\n*Laozi* said: Heaven attains its height, earth attains its depth; the sun shines, the stars array themselves brightly; yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by rectifying their Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; rain and dew descend in season, yet do not nurture the grasses and trees. When spirit and clarity connect, yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within, nests spirit in the heart, still and silent, joyful and harmonious in the breast. Vast and formless, silent and soundless. The government offices seem empty of affairs; the court appears devoid of people. There are no recluses, no idle folk, no forced labor, no resentful punishments. All under heaven look up to the ruler’s image and the sovereign’s intent. From distant lands and foreign customs, none fail to come through repeated translation—not because they visit every household and meet every person, but because the ruler extends their sincere heart to all under heaven.\n\nThus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is the proper command; what enables it to be carried out is sincerity. Though the command may be clear, it cannot act alone—it must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to cover the people yet they do not follow, it is because sincerity does not embrace them.\n\n*Laozi* said: Heaven sets the sun and moon, arrays the stars, extends the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. The day dries, the night rests, the wind desiccates, rain and dew moisten. In generating things, none see how they are nourished, yet the myriad things grow; in destroying things, none see how they are lost, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit clarity.\n\nThus, the sage emulates this: in bestowing fortune, none see how it arises; in removing calamity, none see how it departs. Scrutiny finds nothing, investigation reveals no falsehood. Daily reckoning is insufficient, yearly reckoning is abundant. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is how the heart of heaven moves and transforms.\n\nWhen sincerity takes form within, qi stirs in heaven. Auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow. The rivers do not overflow, the seas do not surge. When one defies heaven and harms things, the sun and moon are eclipsed, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons conflict, day and night reverse their brightness, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, winter thunders, summer frosts.\n\nHeaven and man communicate with one another. Thus, when a state declines, celestial omens change; when the world is in chaos, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected; essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the affairs of spirit clarity cannot be achieved through cleverness or forced through strength.\n\nThus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, numinosity with ghosts and spirits, and trust with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, holding the qi of earth, grasping the central and containing harmony, they do not leave their hall yet traverse the four seas, transforming customs and habits. The people shift toward goodness as if born from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\n*Laozi* said: The Way of man is to preserve one’s nature and protect one’s authenticity, not harming one’s body. When encountering urgent difficulties, essence connects with heaven. If one has never departed from their origin, what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced or overpowered. How much more so for those who govern heaven and earth, embrace the myriad things, return to the Creator, and contain ultimate harmony—yet they have never truly died.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood externally in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When the sage is above, embracing the Dao without speaking, their virtue extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven. When spirit and qi respond, it is subtle indeed. This is called the eloquence of silence, the Dao beyond Dao.",

      "translated_text": "To summon the distant, let there be non-action; to draw near, let speech be without affairs. Only those who walk in the night may attain this—turning back horses to manure fields, chariot tracks not reaching beyond distant lands. This is called \"sitting in stillness while racing afar, sinking into obscurity.\"\n\nThe Dao of Heaven approaches without partiality and departs without partiality. The capable have abundance; the deficient fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it meet misfortune. Thus, governing by cleverness makes it difficult to sustain a state. Only those who align with the Great Harmony and uphold natural response can attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like a circle and its circumference—distance makes them near, proximity makes them obscure. Scrutinized, they cannot be grasped; examined, they are not empty. Therefore, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without concealing, unaffected by things yet unharmed. What they gain is thus their loss; what they lose is thus their gain. Those who penetrate the Great Harmony are dim as if deeply drunk, sweetly reclining to wander within it—never having departed from their origin. This is called \"great penetration,\" where non-use is the very fulfillment of use.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed all under heaven by ordering the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, moderating the measures of the four seasons, correcting the calculations of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few, the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons yielded harvests without famine, officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors harmonized without blame, laws and decrees were clear and not obscure, assistants were just and not sycophantic. Farmers yielded boundaries; roads were free of lost items; markets had no prearranged prices. In that era, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in due season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled all under heaven, he rested his head on a square pillow and slept on a straight mat, slaying autumn and restraining winter. Embracing the square earth and holding the round heaven, he dredged the obstructed passages where yin and yang stagnated, severed the perverse qi that harmed creatures and accumulated harm, and cut them off. His people were simple and ignorant, unaware of east or west, their vision dim, their steps unsteady, yet content in their innocence, knowing not whence they came. Floating and drifting, they knew not their origin, wandering aimlessly without direction. In that time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes—none failed to sheathe their claws and fangs, conceal their stings and poisons. Their merit equaled heaven and earth.\n\nYet when the Yellow Emperor retired to the ancestral temple, he did not display his achievements or proclaim his name, concealing the Way of the True Person to follow the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. How then did the Dao and virtue ascend, while cunning and artifice vanish?\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear them; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the True Person does true wisdom arise. If what they uphold is not illuminated, how can one know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance?\n\nAccumulating kindness and valuing wealth, making the myriad people joyful and delighting in their lives—this is *ren* (benevolence). Establishing great deeds, displaying illustrious names, embodying ruler and minister, rectifying superior and inferior, clarifying close and distant, preserving imperiled states, continuing severed lineages, and establishing heirs for the heirless—this is *yi* (righteousness). Closing the nine orifices, concealing will and intent, abandoning cleverness and returning to unknowing, wandering hazily beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is *de* (virtue).\n\nThus, the Dao disperses into virtue; virtue overflows into *ren* and *yi*. When *ren* and *yi* are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned.\n\nLaozi said: When spirit scatters, words become florid; when virtue dissipates, conduct turns false. When the utmost essence is dim within, yet words and actions are observed without—this is to be enslaved by things. Essence may be exhausted, but conduct has no end; what is guarded is unstable, and one is seduced by the winds of worldly custom. Therefore, the sage cultivates the arts of the Dao within and does not outwardly adorn *ren* and *yi*, knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs while roaming in the harmony of spirit. This is the sage’s wandering.\n\nLaozi said: As for the sage’s wandering—it moves in utmost emptiness, roams the mind in the Great Nothing, gallops beyond boundaries, walks through no gate, listens to no sound, sees no form, unbound by the world, unshackled by custom. Thus, what the sage uses to move all under heaven is not surpassed by the True Person; what the worthy use to rectify the age is not observed by the sage.\n\nThose bound by worldly custom must have their forms constrained and spirits drained, thus unable to avoid separation. If I can be constrained and bound, it is because my fate lies outside.\n\nLaozi said: The ruler’s thoughts—spirit does not gallop within the breast, wisdom does not extend beyond the four quarters. Embracing a heart of *ren* and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring births and summer grows, autumn harvests and winter stores. Monthly inspections and seasonal reviews, annual tributes presented, the people nurtured with impartiality, awe inspired with sincerity, laws simplified and not cumbersome, education as if by spirit, punishments lenient and prisons empty. All under heaven shares one custom, none harboring treacherous hearts—this is the sage’s thought.\n\nIf superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without yielding. The people grow poor and bitter, disputes arise; labor is toilsome yet fruitless. Cunning and deceit sprout; bandits and thieves multiply. Superiors and inferiors resent each other; decrees go unheeded. As muddy water makes fish gasp, harsh governance makes the people rebel. When superiors have many desires, inferiors grow deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors demand much, inferiors contend. Treating symptoms without addressing the root is no different from digging a ditch to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire.\n\nThe sage’s affairs are few yet governance is sought; little is done yet sufficiency abounds. Without acting, there is *ren*; without speaking, there is trust; without seeking, there is attainment; without striving, there is accomplishment. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost truth, holding the Dao and extending sincerity—all under heaven follows like an echo responding to sound, a shadow mimicking form. What they cultivate is the root.",
      "overlap_context": "armony—yet they have never truly died.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood externally in the hearts of others—this is the untransmitted Dao. When the sage is above, embracing the Dao without speaking, their virtue extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and boundless! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, deceit and treachery manifest in heaven. When spirit and qi respond, it is subtle indeed. This is called the eloquence of silence, the Dao beyond Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and the mind’s deliberations churn within, one cannot govern the body. The farther the spirit is employed, the nearer what is abandoned. Thus, *\"Without stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven; without peering through the window, one knows the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"* This speaks of sincerity issuing from within and the spirit’s *qi* stirring heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The winter sun’s warmth, the summer sun’s coolness—all things turn to them yet none compel them. This is the utmost natural and perfect resonance: unsummoned, it comes; without departure, it goes. Subtle and obscure, its workings unknown, yet its achievements arise of themselves. If one must await sight to see or words to command, governance becomes difficult. Gaoyao was mute yet served as Grand Judge, and the realm knew no cruel punishments—what need had he for speech? Shikuang was blind yet served as Grand Minister, and Jin knew no disordered governance—what need had he for sight? The command that requires no words, the vision that requires no eyes—this is how the sage becomes a teacher. The people’s transformation by their superiors follows not their words but their conduct. Thus, when a ruler favors valor, though he does not incite strife, the state will face many crises, and in time, there will surely be violent upheavals. When a ruler favors beauty, though he does not encourage licentious talk, the state will grow chaotic, and over time, it will descend into debauchery and disorder. Therefore, the sage’s sincerity is distinguished within, and his likes and dislikes are clear without. His words match his feelings, and his decrees clarify his intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to suppress villainy. Only spiritual transformation is prized. Perfection in essence is spirit; where essence moves, it is like the spring’s growth or the autumn’s withering.\n\nThus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hairsbreadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nLaozi said: Though laws are hung and rewards set, customs cannot be changed if sincerity is not embraced. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their character; observing their music reveals their customs; seeing their customs reveals their transformation. Those who hold to truth and offer sincerity move heaven and earth, and their spirit transcends all bounds. Commands are obeyed and prohibitions heeded. Sincerity penetrates the Dao and conveys its intent—though not a word is spoken, the myriad people, beasts, and spirits of heaven and earth transform with it. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next best ensures none dare do wrong; the lowest rewards the worthy and punishes the violent.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Dao is non-action; non-action is non-possession. What does not possess does not abide; what does not abide dwells in formlessness. Formless, it does not move; motionless, it does not speak. Speechless, it is still and without sound or form—soundless and formless, it cannot be seen or heard. This is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit, *\"continuous yet ever-present,\"* *\"the root of heaven and earth.\"* The Dao is soundless, so the sage strives to give it form, using a single phrase to name the Dao of heaven and earth. The great takes the small as its root; the many take the few as their beginning. The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are vast, his power and name supreme. The beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth, so he must not fail to follow the Great Dao as the mother of all under heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the destitute and aiding the urgent gives rise to fame and profit; removing harm brings success. In an age without disasters, even the sage has no virtue to display; when superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no merit to establish. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Dao, and extends boundless wisdom. Though he rests in silence and does not speak, all under heaven esteem his wordlessness. Thus, *\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* What is inscribed on bamboo and silk or carved in metal and stone—what can be transmitted to others—is but its coarse aspect.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different paths yet shared the same heart; they took different routes yet reached the same destination. Scholars of later ages, not knowing the embodiment of the Dao or the essential unity of virtue, seize upon the traces of past achievements, kneeling and discoursing upon them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of. The sage, without leaving his seat, sets all under heaven right. His feeling is more urgent than a cry for help. Thus, when words are the same, trust precedes them; when commands are the same, sincerity lies beyond them. When the sage is above, the people are transformed as if by spirit. When feeling precedes action, yet the above moves and the below does not respond, it is because feeling and command differ.\n\nA three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet a loving mother’s care for it grows ever deeper—this is feeling. Thus, the use of words brings change, but the change is small; the use of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trust is the noble person’s word; loyalty, their intent. Loyalty and trust take shape within and move others without—this is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father, a minister’s death for his lord—these are not done to seek fame but because devotion resides within and does not shrink from peril. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned but arises from within. One must also examine their conduct. The sage is not ashamed of his shadow; the noble person is cautious in solitude. To abandon the near and seek the far is to block the way.\n\nThus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, they long for his intent, never forgetting the desire to benefit others.\n\nLaozi said: When a brave warrior cries out, the three armies part. If his cry’s sincerity is met with no response, if his intent is not carried, there must be discord within. One who sets all under heaven right without leaving his seat seeks it within himself. Thus, where persuasion does not reach, countenance does; where countenance does not reach, subtle influence does. When feeling stirs the heart and takes form, the utmost essence can be met in form, though it cannot be foreseen.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Words have their root, affairs have their foundation. Lose their root and foundation, and though one’s skills be many, it is better to speak little. Harm the many by showing off Zhuī’s craft, severing his fingers to prove that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise artisan works not by ability but by timing, closing when he does not know how to close, and so must block before he opens.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths but reach the same end; survival and ruin, stability and collapse are as one to him, for his intent never forgets the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in transmission yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all express sorrow. Song is the subtle manifestation of joy, weeping the outward sign of grief. What stirs within is expressed without, and so lies the power to move others. The sage’s heart day and night never forgets the desire to benefit others, and the reach of his virtue extends far indeed.\n\nLaozi said: When people govern through non-action, action only brings harm. To govern through non-action is to act as though not acting; those who act cannot achieve non-action, and those who cannot achieve non-action cannot act. When people speak not, their spirit is whole; when they speak, their spirit is harmed. Those who lack spirit in silence carry no silence, and so harm the spirit of those who possess it.\n\nWenzi said: A name may be forcibly established, merit forcibly achieved. Once, Nanrong Chou was ashamed that the sagely Dao was absent in himself alone. He traveled south to see Laozi and received a single word of teaching. His spirit became enlightened, his obstructions dissolved, and his diligence was such that for ten days he ate nothing, yet felt as though feasting on a grand sacrifice. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured through later generations, his wisdom spanned heaven and earth, and his discernment reached the finest detail. His praises resounded in elegant speech, ceaseless even today—this is what it means for a name to be forcibly established. Thus, if farmers do not strive, their granaries will not fill; if officials do not exert themselves, their sincerity will not be refined; if generals and ministers do not press forward, their achievements will not be realized; if kings and lords grow lax, they will drift through the age without renown.\n\nThe perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder hidden away. He acts in accord with the times, achieves merit through available resources, advances and retreats without difficulty, and encounters no obstruction. The perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and his virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, he rejoices without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, he grieves as though in mourning.\n\nThus, “One who grieves for the people’s grief, the people will grieve for his grief; one who rejoices in the people’s joy, the people will rejoice in his joy. Therefore, to grieve with all under heaven and rejoice with all under heaven—yet not become king, such a thing has never been.”\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached. It abides in an unshakable place, accumulates in an inexhaustible storehouse, and is borne in an unfailing treasury. His decrees issue like the source of flowing water, placing the people in offices where no contention arises. He opens doors that must be entered, does not attempt what cannot be accomplished, does not seek what cannot be obtained, does not dwell where he cannot remain long, and does not act where he cannot return.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings joy, and none do not follow his command. When command is followed, obedience ensues, and the small leads to the great. When command is resisted, good becomes harm, and success becomes failure.\n\nThe so-called great person is strong within and radiant without. Strong within like heaven and earth, radiant without like sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without exception; sun and moon illuminate all without fail. The great person shows goodness to others without altering his principles or changing his constancy. All under heaven heed his command as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance errs in spring, Jupiter’s movement waxes and wanes, not abiding in its regular path. When governance errs in summer, Mars retrogrades. When governance errs in autumn, Venus does not appear where it should, its comings and goings irregular. When governance errs in winter, Mercury does not manifest in its proper quarter. When governance fails in all four seasons, Saturn sways and trembles, sun and moon show omens, the five planets move in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish. When summer governance is not lost, rain falls in season. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper.

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was profound obscurity, a primordial unity, silent and limpid. The heavy and turbid congealed into earth; the pure and subtle ascended as heaven. Separating, they became the four seasons; dividing, they became yin and yang. Refined qi formed humans; coarse qi formed insects. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates from heaven; bones and flesh are rooted in earth. When spirit enters its gate, bones and flesh return to their root—what then remains of me? Thus the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom, undistracted by others. Heaven is father, earth is mother; yin and yang are the warp, the four seasons the weft. Heaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. All things that oppose this perish; those that accord with it live. Thus stillness and emptiness are the abode of spirit and luminosity; void and nothingness are where the Dao resides.\n\nSpirit is what one receives from heaven; bones and flesh are what one is endowed with from earth. *\"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang; through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.\"*\n\nLaozi said: Humans are born through the transformations of heaven and earth. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is complete; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera take shape. The liver governs the eyes; the kidneys, the ears; the spleen, the tongue; the lungs, the nose; the gallbladder, the mouth. The exterior is the surface; the interior, the core. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has four seasons, five phases, nine divisions, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder is clouds; the lungs, qi; the spleen, wind; the kidneys, rain; the liver, thunder. Humans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs all.\n\nThe eyes and ears are the sun and moon; blood and qi are wind and rain. When the sun and moon deviate from their paths, they are eclipsed and lose their light. When wind and rain come unseasonably, they bring destruction and disaster. When the five planets stray from their courses, states and regions suffer calamity. The Dao of heaven and earth is vast and great, yet it still moderates its brilliance and cherishes its spirit and luminosity. How then can human ears and eyes endure prolonged stimulation without rest? How can spirit gallop without exhaustion? Thus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external.\n\nBlood and qi are the glory of humans; the five viscera are their essence. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, and hearing and vision are sharp—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart from it, qi and intention prevail, conduct is not perverse, spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus one hears all without fail, sees all without obstruction, and accomplishes all without hindrance. Misfortune and disaster have no way to enter; sorrowful qi cannot assail. Therefore, those who seek much gain little; those who perceive the great know little.\n\nThe orifices are the doors and windows of spirit; blood and qi are the messengers and sentinels of the five viscera. Thus when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and spirit gallops without restraint. Though fortune and misfortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to perceive them. Thus the sage cherishes and does not transgress.\n\nIf the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and profoundly penetrating, undistracted by temptations, and that intention and qi are not lost to tranquility and few desires, the five viscera will be at peace. When spirit guards the form internally and does not stray, one can observe beyond past ages and within future affairs, and the boundary between fortune and misfortune becomes as nothing. Thus the farther one ventures, the less one knows. This is to say that spirit must not be allowed to indulge externally.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, making them unclear; the five sounds enter the ears, making them dull; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing sores. Pursuits and aversions disturb the heart, making conduct reckless. Thus desires make human qi excessive; likes and dislikes make spirit weary. If one does not swiftly eliminate them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish.\n\nThe reason humans cannot fulfill their natural lifespan is due to the excess of life-sustaining indulgences. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to can attain longevity. Heaven and earth move and interconnect; the myriad things are gathered into one. One who knows the One knows all; one who does not know the One knows nothing. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and all things are likewise things. How can things be distinguished from one another? Desire for life cannot be served; aversion to death cannot be refused. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling into tranquility, not daring to go to extremes—this is the utmost joy.\n\nTo guard emptiness: Laozi said: The so-called sage adapts to the times and finds peace in his position, engages with the world and delights in his work. Grief and joy are perversions of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the movement of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. In stillness, one harmonizes with yin and virtue; in movement, one aligns with yang and its currents. Thus the heart is the master of the form; spirit is the treasure of the heart. If the form labors without rest, it stumbles; if spirit is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore the sage follows this and does not dare transgress.\n\nResponding to being with non-being, one must thoroughly investigate principle; receiving the solid with the void, one must exhaust its limits. Serene, joyful, empty, and still, one fulfills one’s destiny. Without attachment, without partiality, embracing virtue and warming harmony, one accords with heaven. One’s boundary is the Dao; one’s neighbor is virtue. Not initiating fortune, not preceding misfortune, life and death bring no change to oneself—this is called utmost spirit.",

      "translated_text": "The spirit seeks nothing it does not await, and thus nothing is left unaccomplished. In guarding the void, Laozi says: \"Lighten the world, and the spirit is unburdened; refine the myriad things, and the heart is undeluded. Equalize life and death, and the mind is unafraid; harmonize with transformation, and clarity is unswayed.\"\n\nThe utmost person leans upon an unyielding pillar, walks an unbounded path, draws from an inexhaustible store, and studies an undying teacher. There is nowhere they do not succeed, nothing they do not penetrate. In bending and stretching, bowing and rising, they embrace fate without confusion, turning and adapting. Misfortune and fortune, benefit and harm are insufficient to trouble their heart.\n\nThose who act with righteousness may be pressed with benevolence but cannot be coerced with arms; they may be guided with justice but cannot be lured with profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or honor; those who act with righteousness cannot be frightened by death or peril—how much more so for those who practice non-action!\n\nThe one who practices non-action is without burden. The unburdened person takes the world as their shadow and pillar. Gazing upward at the ranks of the utmost persons, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining below the conduct of the vulgar world, they find it sufficient to feel shame. Those who do not take the world as their concern treat learning like a drum beaten in vain.\n\nIn guarding equilibrium, Laozi says: \"Esteem and thick profit are what people covet, yet compared to the self, they are base. Thus the sage eats enough to fill the void and join qi, wears enough to cover the form and ward off cold, satisfies desires and rejects excess, neither coveting gain nor hoarding abundantly. The eyes do not see, the ears do not hear, the mouth does not speak, the heart does not ponder. Abandoning cleverness and returning to simplicity, resting the spirit, discarding knowledge and habit, without likes or dislikes—this is called great penetration. To remove filth and cast off burdens, nothing compares to never having departed from one’s origin. What could not then be accomplished?\n\nOne who knows the harmony of nurturing life cannot be lured with profit; one who unites the inner and outer tally cannot be enticed with power. Beyond the external is the greatest; within the internal is the most noble. To know the greatest and most noble—where could one not succeed?\n\nIn guarding simplicity, Laozi says: \"The ancients who practiced the Dao regulated emotions and nature, cultivated the heart’s methods, nurtured with harmony, and maintained with moderation. They delighted in the Dao and forgot lowliness; their virtue was secure, and they forgot poverty. If nature has no desires, there is nothing desired that is not obtained; if the heart has no joys, there is no joy that is not pursued. What does not benefit nature is not used to burden virtue; what does not suit life is not used to disturb harmony.\n\nNot indulging the self or following whim but adhering to measure, one can serve as a model for the world. Measuring the belly to eat, shaping the form to clothe, fitting the body to dwell, and acting according to feeling, one leaves the world in surplus without possessing it and entrusts the myriad things without profiting from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness cause one to lose one’s nature and life? One who remains thus can be said to embody the Dao.\n\nIn guarding purity, Laozi says: \"Humans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes respond to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth to fragrances and odors, the skin to cold and warmth—these inclinations are one. Yet some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty. The difference lies in the restraints imposed.\n\nThe spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is balanced. No one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus, only when the spirit is clear and the mind balanced can one perceive the nature of things. Therefore, those who employ it must borrow from non-employment.\n\nA bright mirror is not sullied by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. When the heart reaches a point, the spirit is fully present; returning to emptiness, agitation subsides and stillness is stored—this is the wandering of the sage. Thus, those who govern the world must first thoroughly understand the nature of life and destiny.\n\nIn guarding authenticity, Laozi says: \"What is called the sage simply accords with feeling: measuring the belly to eat, gauging the form to clothe, restraining the self so that greedy and corrupt thoughts have no way to arise. Thus, one who can possess the world must not take the world as their own; one who can possess fame and reputation must not seek it through transgressive conduct. Truly understanding the nature of life and destiny, benevolence and righteousness naturally follow.\n\nIf the spirit is unobscured and the heart unburdened, penetrating and unobstructed, serene and without affairs, then power and profit cannot lure, sounds and sights cannot seduce, eloquence cannot persuade, wisdom cannot move, and bravery cannot frighten—this is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThose who give life do not live; those who transform do not transform. One who does not grasp this Dao, though they comprehend heaven and earth, illuminate the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make words flow like metal and stone, still brings no benefit to the world. Thus, the sage does not lose what they guard.\n\nIn guarding stillness, Laozi says: \"Stillness, silence, tranquility, and indifference nurture life; harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one’s nature finds its proper place; still and unmoving, harmonious, virtue rests securely in its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to complete one’s years—this can be called embodying the Dao.\n\nOne who is thus has unobstructed blood and qi, no stagnant qi in the five viscera. Misfortune and fortune cannot disturb, praise and blame cannot sully. Without possessing the world, who could aid them? One with talent who does not meet their time cannot even free themselves—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nOne whose eyes discern the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; one whose ears attune to the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus, a small focus causes one to forget the great. Now, the myriad things assail, plucking at one’s life, seizing one’s essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive it, how is it possible?\n\nA basin of water, if clear for days, can reflect one’s eyebrows and lashes; if muddied by a single stir, it cannot show square or round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy—just like the basin of water.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Dao of Upholding the Law\nLaozi said: The highest sages model themselves on Heaven; those next esteem worthies; those below employ ministers. To employ ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to esteem worthies is the source of delusion and confusion; to model oneself on Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness reign supreme: emptiness receives all, stillness sustains all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus, the sage takes stillness as order and movement as chaos. Therefore, it is said: Do not stir, do not disturb—all things will clarify themselves; do not alarm, do not frighten—all things will govern themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\nThe Dao of Guarding Weakness\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world or a state as their household and the myriad things as their livestock. Embracing the world’s vastness and possessing the multitude of things, their qi becomes full and their ambitions arrogant. The great use force to invade the small; the small are haughty and domineering toward those below. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long.\n\nThus, the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and practicing non-action without harming the primal qi. Perceiving the small, they guard softness; withdrawing, they possess nothing, modeling themselves on rivers and seas. Rivers and seas do not act, yet their merit and fame transform naturally. Not forcing, they thus complete their kingship. Being the female of the world, their spirit does not die. Loving themselves, they thus achieve their nobility. With the power of ten thousand chariots and the myriad things as their merit and fame, their authority and responsibility are of the utmost weight—they cannot slight themselves. To slight oneself is to fail in merit and fame.\n\nThe Dao is great yet completed through the small, numerous yet ruled by the few. Thus, the sage guides the world with the Dao. Softness, weakness, subtlety, and minuteness are the perception of the small; frugality, thrift, reduction, and deficiency are the perception of the few. Perceiving the small, they thus complete the great; perceiving the few, they thus complete the beautiful.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low, diminishes excess to supply insufficiency. Rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to and serves them. The sage is humble, modest, pure, still, and yielding—this is the perception of lowness. Emptying the heart and having nothing is the perception of insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, they thus attain their height; perceiving insufficiency, they thus complete their worthiness. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure; the aggressive perish; the overflowing are ruined. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last a day; small valleys cannot remain full for a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains carry the qi of aggression, thus they cannot last and perish. Small valleys occupy the terrain of aggression, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore, the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons extravagance and arrogance, and dares not act with aggressive qi. Holding to the female and the yielding, they thus establish their maleness and virility. Not daring to be extravagant and arrogant, they thus endure long.\n\nThus, Laozi said: The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then reverses; when full, it diminishes—this is seen in the sun and moon. The sage daily diminishes, and the primal qi does not dare to fill itself; daily advancing with the female, their merit and virtue do not decline. This is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHuman emotions and natures all favor the high and dislike the low, favor gain and dislike loss, favor profit and dislike harm, favor honor and dislike humility, favor nobility and dislike baseness. The multitude act accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; clinging to these, they cannot attain.\n\nThus, the sage models themselves on Heaven, accomplishing without acting and attaining without grasping. Sharing the same emotions as others yet following a different Dao, they thus endure long.\n\nTherefore, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called the \"admonishing goblet.\" When empty, it stands upright; when full, it overturns.\n\nAll things flourish and then decline; the sun at its zenith moves on; the moon at its fullness wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Thus, the keen of hearing and sharp of sight guard themselves with foolishness; the learned and eloquent guard themselves with frugality; the martial and brave guard themselves with awe; the rich and powerful guard themselves with narrowness; those whose virtue extends to the world guard themselves with yielding. These five are how the former kings guarded the world.\n\n\"Those who practice this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one remain whole without renewal.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage is at ease with yin and open with yang, able to reach the state of no joy—thus there is nothing not joyful. Being nothing not joyful is the ultimate joy. Therefore, inner joy is externalized, not the reverse. Thus, one has self-joy and self-worth, esteeming the world. The reason is that they grasp the world’s essentials.\n\nIt does not lie in others but in oneself; not in people but in one’s own body. When the body attains it, the myriad things are complete.\n\nThus, those who master the discourse on the arts of the heart have desires and aversions externalized. Therefore, they have no joy, no anger, no pleasure, no suffering. The myriad things are profoundly united, without right or wrong.\n\nThus, the scholar has unchanging principles; the woman has unalterable conduct. They do not rely on power to be honored, nor on wealth to be rich, nor on force to be strong. They do not value goods and wealth, do not covet worldly fame, do not find security in nobility, nor danger in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and will each reside in their proper place.\n\nForm is the dwelling of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life. If one loses their proper place, all three are harmed. Thus, those who take spirit as their master have form following and benefiting; those who take form as their controller have spirit following and harming.\n\nThose who live with greed, rapacity, and many desires are most suited to power and profit, enticed and admiring of fame and position. Almost surpassing others in wisdom, their position elevated above the world, their spirit daily dissipates and drifts far away. Long indulging without returning, their form is idle and their center blocked—there is no way in. Thus, they often suffer from blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, will, and qi: when still, they daily fill and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Thus, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and weakens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, and floats and sinks with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things have nothing that does not correspond, and the changes of a hundred affairs have nothing that does not respond.\n\nThe Dao of Guarding Simplicity\nLaozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature harmonizes with the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, to possess yet seem as though without, to be full yet seem as though empty—cultivate the inner and not the outer. Comprehend the Great Simplicity, act without contrivance and return to uncarved simplicity. Embrace the root and hold fast to spirit, roaming the root of Heaven and Earth. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. Schemes, wit, and cunning are not carried in the heart. Discerning the unborrowed, one does not shift with things. Perceiving the transformations of affairs, one guards their origin. The heart’s intent is focused within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Dwelling without knowing what one does, moving without knowing where one goes. Knowing without learning, seeing without looking, accomplishing without acting, distinguishing without governing. Responding to stimuli, moving under compulsion, proceeding only when unavoidable—like light shining, like a shadow following. Following the Dao as one’s guide, depending on conditions to be so. Vast and empty, clear and still, without anything. Taking a thousand births as one transformation, taking ten thousand differences as one origin.\n\nThere is essence yet it is not employed; there is spirit yet it is not used. Guarding the great undifferentiated simplicity, standing at the center of utmost purity. In sleep, no dreams; in thought, no sprouting. In movement, no form; in stillness, no body. Existing yet seeming to vanish, living yet seeming to die. Entering and exiting without gap, commanding ghosts and spirits. What spirit and essence can ascend and borrow from the thousand Dao.\n\nLet spirit flow freely without losing its origin. Day and night without interruption, harmonizing with things as spring. This is to unite and give birth to time within the heart.\n\nThus, the form may decay, yet the spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation without transforming, endlessly turning through a thousand changes without beginning or end. What transforms returns to formlessness; what does not transform is born together with Heaven and Earth. Those born together with Heaven and Earth never transform what they transform—this is the True Person’s roaming in the pure and unadorned Dao.\n\n**Chapter Four: Accordant Sayings**\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; supremely deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It envelops Heaven and Earth without inside or outside, pervades and covers without obstruction. Thus, one who embodies the Dao is neither angered nor delighted. Seated, without anxiety; asleep, without dreams. Seeing things, they name them; affairs arrive, they respond.\n\nLaozi said: Those who covet fame as their corpse must generate affairs. Affairs arise, and they abandon the public for the private, forsake the Dao to rely on themselves. Seeing praise, they perform good deeds; establishing themselves, they become worthy. Thus, governance does not follow principle, and affairs do not accord with the times. Governance that does not follow principle brings much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Acting recklessly to hit the mark, success is insufficient to absolve blame, while failure is enough to destroy the self.\n\nLaozi said: Do not be the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of cunning.\n\nConceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move only when unavoidable. Desire fortune, first avoid misfortune; desire benefit, first distance harm.\n\nThus, one who attains tranquility through non-action—losing that tranquility, they face peril. One who governs through non-action—losing that governance, they face chaos. Therefore, “Do not desire to be bustling like jade, nor aloof like stone.”\n\nFine patterns invite flaying; beautiful horns invite slaughter. Sweet springs must dry up; straight trees must be felled. Florid words later become transgressions. Stones bearing jade harm their mountains; the people’s calamities are rooted in speech.\n\nLaozi said: Act in accord with the times, yet those who do not know the Dao turn fortune into misfortune.\n\nHeaven as the canopy, Earth as the crossbar—those who skillfully use the Dao never come to an end. Earth as the crossbar, Heaven as the canopy—those who skillfully use the Dao never suffer harm.\n\nDisplaying the five phases, there must be conquest. What Heaven covers is without exception fitting. Thus, “To know yet seem not to know is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.”\n\nLaozi said: Mountains bear metal, stones bear jade—they mutually erode. Trees bear insects, which return to consume them. People create affairs, which return to harm them.\n\nThose who love affairs are never without fault; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Skilled swimmers drown; skilled riders fall. Each suffers calamity through their own loves.\n\nAttainment lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth dwells below without contending for height—thus it is secure and not imperiled. Water flows downward without contending for speed—thus it departs and is not delayed.\n\n“Thus, the sage has no attachments and so no losses, acts without contrivance and so no defeats.”\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot be exhausted; two words are the world’s foundation. Three words make a feudal lord mighty; four words make the world a pair.\n\nIntegrity and trustworthiness cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the world’s foundation. Exalting worthy virtue makes a feudal lord mighty; detesting the few and loving the many makes the world a pair.\n\nLaozi said: People suffer three deaths not by fate: immoderate eating and drinking, belittling the body—disease kills them together. Unrestrained pleasure and endless desire—punishment kills them together. Attacking the many with the few, bullying the strong with the weak—weapons kill them together.\n\nLaozi said: Generous giving yields beautiful recompense; great resentment yields deep misfortune. Giving little yet expecting much, harboring resentment yet hoping for no calamity—such has never been.\n\nExamine what has gone, and you will know what is to come.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the Mandate of Heaven, cultivate the heart’s methods, order likes and dislikes, adapt to temperament—then the Dao of governance is unobstructed.\n\nTracing the Mandate of Heaven, one is not deluded by fortune and misfortune. Cultivating the heart’s methods, one does not recklessly rejoice or anger. Ordering likes and dislikes, one does not covet the useless. Adapting to temperament, desires do not exceed measure.\n\nNot deluded by fortune and misfortune, movement and stillness follow; not recklessly rejoicing or angering, rewards and punishments are not biased. Not coveting the useless, one does not harm their nature with desires. Desires not exceeding measure, one nurtures life and knows contentment. In all these four, one does not seek from without nor borrow from others—turning inward, they attain it.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue actions that can be criticized; do not resent others’ criticisms of oneself. Cultivate virtues that suffice for praise; do not seek others’ praise of oneself.",
      "overlap_context": "still, they daily fill and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Thus, the sage nurtures their spirit, harmonizes and weakens their qi, levels and pacifies their form, and floats and sinks with the Dao. In this way, the transformations of the myriad things have nothing that does not correspond, and the changes of a hundred affairs have nothing that does not respond.\n\nThe Dao of Guarding Simplicity\nLaozi said: The so-called True Person is one whose nature harmonizes with the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Not able to prevent misfortune from arriving, one trusts in one’s own lack of wisdom; not able to ensure fortune’s certain coming, one trusts in one’s own lack of presumption. Misfortune’s arrival is not of one’s own making, thus one is impoverished yet not anxious; fortune’s coming is not of one’s own achievement, thus one is prosperous yet not arrogant. Therefore, dwelling in leisure, the heart is joyful; acting without contrivance, order prevails.\n\nLaozi said: The Daoist guards what they already possess and does not seek what they do not yet have. Seeking what one has not yet obtained, what one already possesses is lost; cultivating what one already has, what one desires arrives.\n\nGoverning is not secured by preventing disorder, yet those who act to govern inevitably court peril. Conduct is not exempt from wrongdoing, yet those who hastily seek fame inevitably suffer harm. Thus, no fortune surpasses the absence of misfortune, no benefit surpasses the absence of loss. Hence, “Things may be augmented yet diminished, diminished yet augmented.”\n\nThe Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue profit, yet it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Thus, one may taste the absence of misfortune but not the presence of fortune; one may taste the absence of guilt but not the presence of merit. The Dao is said to be vast and obscure, following Heaven’s majesty. In harmony with Heaven’s qi, it is without thought or planning, without preparation or storage. What comes is not welcomed; what goes is not pursued. Though people move east, west, south, or north, one stands alone at the center.\n\nThus, amidst crooked multitudes, one does not lose their straightness. Flowing with the world, one does not depart from their domain. Neither pursuing goodness nor avoiding ugliness, one follows Heaven’s Dao. Not initiating, not monopolizing the self, one follows Heaven’s principles. Without premeditation, without forsaking the times, one takes Heaven as their measure. Not seeking gain, not refusing fortune, one follows Heaven’s norms. Within, no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise, and how could there be harm from others?\n\nTherefore, the highest virtue speaks as if offering bribes, acts as if bestowing favors. Above and below share one heart, without divergent paths or peripheral distractions. Rejecting the devious, opening the way to goodness, the people turn toward uprightness.\n\nLaozi said: To do good is to encourage; to do evil is to observe. Encouragement breeds responsibility; observation breeds trouble. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame but can be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor praise through knowledge and perception. Governance follows nature; the self has no part in it. Those who act may not succeed; those who seek may not obtain. People may be obstructed, yet the Dao is never blocked. Those with wisdom yet acting without contrivance achieve the same merit as the unwise; those with ability yet acting without effort attain the same virtue as the incapable. Having wisdom yet appearing unwise, having ability yet appearing incapable—when the Dao’s principles are realized, human talent fades.\n\nPeople and the Dao cannot both be illustrious. When people love fame, they do not employ the Dao; when the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao ceases and human fame flourishes, peril and ruin follow.\n\nLaozi said: If trustworthy men were to distribute wealth, it would be better to determine shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intent are less just than those without. If incorruptible men were to guard wealth, it would be better to seal it behind closed doors. Why? Those with desire are less incorruptible than those without.\n\nPeople resent those who point out their flaws and delight in seeing their own ugliness reflected. One who engages with things without entangling the self is free from burdens.\n\nLaozi said: In all dealings with others, if not with treasures or goods, then with humble words. Yet meager gifts cannot satisfy desire, and submissive speech cannot forge lasting bonds. Oaths and pledges, once made, are broken before the day is done. Thus, the noble person does not adorn themselves with external benevolence and righteousness but inwardly cultivates the Dao and its arts. They attend to affairs within their domain, exhaust its resources, encourage the people to hold fast to death, and fortify their walls. Above and below united in heart, they defend the altars of state. Thus, those who feign virtue do not attack the innocent; those who seek profit do not assault the unobtainable. This is the way of certain preservation, the principle of assured benefit.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome their heart; the multitude does not overcome their desires. The noble person embodies upright qi; the petty person embodies perverse qi. What inwardly accords with one’s nature and outwardly aligns with righteousness, moving in accordance with principle and not bound to things—this is upright qi. Indulging in rich flavors, excessive in sounds and sights, acting on joy and anger without regard for future harm—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright injure one another; desire and nature harm one another. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Thus, the sage abandons desire and follows nature.\n\nThe eye delights in beauty, the ear in sound, the nose in fragrance, the mouth in flavor. Combined, these pleasures cannot be separated from benefit and harm—these are desires. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; the heart governs them all, each attaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desires cannot be overcome.\n\nLaozi said: Those who cultivate the self and nurture their nature regulate their rest and activity, moderate their food and drink, harmonize their joy and anger, and adapt their movement and stillness. What lies within the self is attained, and perverse qi has no way to enter. Adorning the external harms the internal; indulging the emotions harms the spirit. What appears refined obscures the true. Those who never forget their pursuit of worthiness inevitably exhaust their nature; those who forget their appearance even for a hundred paces inevitably burden their form. Thus, beautiful plumage harms the bones; lush branches and leaves harm the roots. One who can perfect both is nowhere to be found in the world.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven has its brightness and does not worry over the people’s darkness; Earth has its wealth and does not worry over the people’s poverty. Those who embody the highest virtue and Dao are like mountains, towering and unmoving. Travelers take them as their guide. Upright in themselves, they suffice for others. They do not bestow gifts upon people, nor do those who use them receive their virtue. Thus, they are at peace and endure long.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not interfere, thus they do not seize; they do not claim virtue, thus they do not incur resentment. Those who are quick to anger inevitably accumulate grievances; those who are quick to give inevitably invite seizure. Only by following Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity can one master principle.\n\nThus, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil accompanies it. Profit is the beginning of harm; fortune is the precursor of misfortune. Not seeking profit, one avoids harm; not seeking fortune, one avoids misfortune. The body’s constancy lies in wholeness; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The sage wears no extravagant garments, nor performs eccentric deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious. He is unassuming yet not coarse, steadfast yet not intimidated, honored yet not ostentatious, reclusive yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In their common use, no name suffices—this is called the Great Permeation.\n\nLaozi said: The Daoist aligns himself and awaits destiny. When the time arrives, one cannot hasten it by rushing forward; when it departs, one cannot grasp it by clinging. Thus, the sage neither advances in pursuit nor retreats in deference. For three years, he follows the time; when the time departs, he withdraws. For three years after it leaves, the time remains behind him. Neither approaching nor receding, he stands at the center of his place.\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it aligns only with virtue. When fortune arrives, it is not sought, so one does not boast of merit; when misfortune comes, it is not self-inflicted, so one does not regret conduct. The heart remains serene, unburdened by virtue. Dogs may bark, but he is not startled; he trusts his nature, his sincerity free from impropriety. Thus, those who master the Dao are not deluded, and those who understand destiny are not anxious.\n\nWhen emperors and kings pass, their remains are interred in the wilds, yet their sacrifices are conducted in the Bright Hall. The spirit is prized above the form. Thus, when the spirit governs the form, it obeys; when the form overpowers the spirit, it falters. Though hearing and sight are employed, they must return to the spirit—this is called the Great Permeation.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness, so their names did not sway their resolve. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty, so profit did not disturb their hearts. Thus, they were humble yet joyful, tranquil yet content.\n\nTo fret over the world’s chaos while calculating one’s lifespan is like weeping to replenish a drying river—it only adds to the sorrow. Therefore, those who do not worry over the world’s disorder but delight in their own governance may be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: People harbor three resentments—those with high rank are envied, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with ample emoluments are resented. Thus, as rank rises, humility must deepen; as office grows, the heart must shrink; as emoluments increase, generosity must broaden. Cultivating these three prevents resentment. Therefore, nobility takes lowliness as its root, and height takes lowness as its foundation.\n\nLaozi said: Speech serves to convey oneself to others; hearing serves to convey others to their ends. If one is deaf to what is heard, the human way is obstructed. Those afflicted with deafness know not how to conduct affairs—yet this is not merely a malady of the body. The heart, too, may be blocked, unaware of its own obstruction. This is akin to deafness and blindness.\n\nThe Dao, as the origin, gives life to all that has form. Its intimacy is profound. Those who feast on grains and consume qi attain longevity—its lordship is benevolent. All the wise study it—its teaching is luminous. Yet people often harm what is useful by deeming it useless. Thus, knowledge is not broadened, and days are insufficient. To spend one’s days in games and gambling while inquiring of the Dao—though one’s learning may deepen, whether one asks or not, it is like comparing the deaf and blind to others.\n\nLaozi said: Human nature submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue lies in giving, not in receiving. Thus, the sage who wishes to be esteemed by others first esteems them; who wishes to be exalted by others first exalts them; who wishes to surpass others first surpasses himself; who wishes to humble others first humbles himself. Therefore, nobility and baseness, exaltation and humility are governed by the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings spoke humbly to others and placed themselves behind them. Thus, the world joyfully upheld them without tiring, bearing them without burden. Their virtue was abundant, their qi harmonious. Thus, to know that giving is receiving and that placing oneself after is advancement is to draw near the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Those with little virtue yet much favor invite ridicule; those with mediocre talent yet high position court danger; those with no great merit yet ample emoluments invite peril. Thus, some things are increased yet diminished, or diminished yet increased. The multitude knows only to seek profit and avoid harm, but the sage knows that harm can be profit, and profit can be harm. Therefore, a tree that bears fruit twice will damage its roots; a family that excavates its treasures will bring calamity upon its descendants. Great profit may turn to harm—such is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The petty person acts for mere gain; the noble person acts for mere righteousness. Those who do good do not seek fame, yet fame follows. Fame does not arrange to bring profit, yet profit accrues. Their aims may be the same, but their ends differ. Thus, every action that brings benefit is followed by harm.\n\nThose whose words lack constancy and whose deeds lack propriety are petty persons. Those discerning in one matter and skilled in one ability are mediocre. Those who encompass all and possess manifold talents, employing them as needed, are sages.\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, in an orderly age, one defends oneself with righteousness; in a chaotic age, one defends righteousness with oneself. The day of death is the end of conduct. Therefore, the noble person is cautious in its singular application.\n\nLife is bestowed by Heaven; destiny is encountered in time. To possess talent yet not meet one’s era is fate. Seek it by proper means, but attain it by destiny. The noble person can do good yet cannot ensure fortune; he may refrain from wrongdoing yet cannot avoid misfortune. Thus, when the noble person encounters the times, he advances, obtaining it through righteousness—what luck is there in that? When the times do not favor him, he retreats, yielding with propriety—what misfortune is there in that? Therefore, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he does not regret, for he has attained what he values.\n\nLaozi said: People possess the qi of compliance and defiance, born of the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi flows smoothly; when the heart is disordered, qi rebels. The order or disorder of the heart lies in morality. Attain the Dao, and the heart is ordered; lose the Dao, and the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, interactions are yielding; when disordered, they are contentious. Yielding cultivates virtue; contention breeds harm. Virtue smooths the qi; harm disrupts it. Smooth qi diminishes the self to serve others; disrupted qi diminishes others to serve the self. These two qi can be guided and controlled.",
      "overlap_context": "to anger inevitably accumulate grievances; those who are quick to give inevitably invite seizure. Only by following Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity can one master principle.\n\nThus, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil accompanies it. Profit is the beginning of harm; fortune is the precursor of misfortune. Not seeking profit, one avoids harm; not seeking fortune, one avoids misfortune. The body’s constancy lies in wholeness; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.",

      "translated_text": "The Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to sound—virtue accumulates and fortune arises; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises.

      "translated_text": "Wenzi asked about the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: When learning is not refined, the hearing of the Dao is not profound. All who listen do so to attain wisdom, to perfect conduct, and to achieve merit and renown. Without refinement, there is no clarity; without depth, there is no penetration. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with the spirit; in middling learning, with the heart; in inferior learning, with the ears. Those who listen with the ears learn only to the skin; those who listen with the heart learn to the flesh; those who listen with the spirit learn to the marrow. If one’s hearing is not profound, one’s knowledge will not be clear; if one’s knowledge is not clear, one cannot fully grasp its essence; if one cannot fully grasp its essence, one’s conduct will not be perfected.\n\nThe principle of listening lies in emptiness of heart and tranquility, in diminishing qi without excess, in being free from thought and worry, in the eyes not gazing recklessly, in the ears not listening carelessly. Accumulate essence and store it steadily; once attained, guard it firmly and preserve it for long. The Dao is the origin and beginning of all things. It begins in softness and weakness, and is completed in hardness and strength; it begins in brevity and scarcity, and is completed in abundance and length. A tree of ten spans begins with a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below—this is the Way of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below, yielding is how one places oneself behind, frugality is how one begins small, and diminishing is how one begins with little. Thus, humility leads to honor, yielding leads to precedence, frugality leads to expansiveness, and diminishing leads to greatness—this is what the Way of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the source of virtue, the root of greatness, the gate of fortune. All things depend upon it to live, to be completed, and to find peace. The Dao is formless and without action; inwardly, it cultivates the self; outwardly, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and its affairs established, it stands beside Heaven. It is without action, yet nothing is left undone. None know its nature, none know its truth, yet within it there is reliability.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, the world submits, and his altars of soil and grain endure. When feudal lords possess the Dao, the people live in harmony, and their states are not lost. When scholars and commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their lives and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without fighting; when the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contending. When affairs are undertaken with the Dao, merit is achieved and fortune attained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness; when father and son possess the Dao, there is compassion and filial piety; when scholars and commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao, there is wisdom; without the Dao, there is pettiness. From this, it is clear that the Dao is fitting for all people in all things.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune. When practiced to its fullest, the world submits, and submission leads to cherishing. Thus, the emperor is the destination of the world, the king is the one to whom the world turns. If the world neither turns toward nor finds its destination in him, he cannot be called emperor or king. Therefore, an emperor or king who does not win the people cannot succeed; even if he wins the people but loses the Dao, he cannot preserve his rule.\n\nThose who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and haughty. They display their excesses, flaunt their brilliance, cling to dominance and rigidity, provoke difficulties, and sow enmity. They become instigators of war and leaders of chaos. When petty men practice this, they bring great calamity upon themselves; when great men practice it, their states perish. The harm may touch only themselves, or it may run deep, reaching their descendants. No crime is greater than being without the Dao, no resentment deeper than being without virtue—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: When Heaven acts through the Dao, even the brave cannot pierce, even the skillful cannot strike. Though they cannot pierce or strike, they may still bring humiliation—how much better to make it so that even the brave cannot pierce, even the skillful cannot strike. Those who dare not act are not without the intention; how much better to be without the intention at all. Those without the intention have no mind to receive harm or benefit—how much better to make it so that all men and women under Heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. If this is so, one may be a ruler without land, an official without office, and the world will wish nothing more than to bring peace and benefit to him. Thus, courage in daring leads to death; courage in not daring leads to life.\n\nWenzi asked about virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To nurture and cultivate, to bring to fruition and cause to grow, to benefit all without partiality, and to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue.\n\nWhat is benevolence? To act as a superior without boasting of one’s merit, to act as a subordinate without shame for one’s faults, to be great without arrogance, to be small without meanness, to love all without selfishness, and to remain steadfast without decline—this is called benevolence.\n\nWhat is righteousness? To act as a superior by aiding the weak, to act as a subordinate by maintaining integrity, to be successful without indulgence, to be impoverished without altering one’s principles, to follow the standard and accord with reason, and to avoid private bias and crookedness—this is called righteousness.\n\nWhat is propriety? To act as a superior with reverence and dignity, to act as a subordinate with humility and respect, to yield and remain gentle, to be the female of the world, to stand in non-daring, and to act from inability—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue leads subordinates to follow commands; cultivating benevolence leads them to cease contention; cultivating righteousness leads them to fairness and uprightness; cultivating propriety leads them to reverence. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure.\n\nThat which gives life is the Dao; that which causes growth is virtue; that which loves is benevolence; that which rectifies is righteousness; that which respects is propriety. Without nurturing and cultivation, there can be no fruition and growth; without kindness and love, there can be no completion; without rectification and correction, there can be no enduring; without respect and esteem, there can be no honor and weight. Thus, virtue is what the people value, benevolence is what they cherish, righteousness is what they fear, and propriety is what they revere. These four are the proper order of culture and the means by which the sage governs all things.\n\nWhen the noble man lacks virtue, his subordinates resent him; when he lacks benevolence, they contend with him; when he lacks righteousness, they become violent; when he lacks propriety, they fall into chaos. If these four principles are not established, it is called being without the Dao. There has never been one without the Dao who did not perish.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: In the age of utmost virtue, merchants thrive in their markets, farmers delight in their fields, ministers rest secure in their offices, recluses cultivate their Way, and the people rejoice in their labors. Thus, wind and rain do not destroy or break, grasses and trees do not wither prematurely, the Yellow River yields its Diagram, and the Luo River brings forth its Writ.\n\nYet when the age declines, taxes and levies know no limit, killing and slaughter know no end. Those who remonstrate are punished, and worthy scholars are executed. Thus, mountains collapse and rivers run dry, creeping things never rest, and the wilds yield no hundred herbs.\n\nTherefore, when the world is well-governed, even fools cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage harmonizes with joy and tranquility—this is life. The Way of utmost virtue prevails—this is fate. Thus, only when life encounters fate can it act; only when fate meets its time can it become manifest. There must first be the age, and only then can there be the man.\n\nWenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom.\nLaozi said: To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. The sage has heard of the origins of fortune and misfortune and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise one has seen fortune and misfortune take shape and chooses conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious of the heavenly Dao, thus understanding the origins of fortune and misfortune. The wise one foresees their formation, thus knowing the gateway of fortune and misfortune. To know before it arises is sagacity; to foresee its formation is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\n\nLaozi said: When a ruler favors righteousness, he trusts the times and relies on himself, wielding wisdom to employ kindness. Yet when things are vast and wisdom shallow, to sustain the vast with the shallow has never been possible. Relying solely on one’s wisdom, losses must be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhaustion; favoring courage is the way to peril and ruin. Favoring giving leads to no fixed allotment. If the superior’s allotment is not fixed, the subordinates’ expectations will never cease. If one levies heavily, one makes enemies of the people; if one takes little but gives much, there is no end to the reckoning. Thus, favoring giving is the way that invites resentment. From this, we see that wealth is not sufficient to rely upon, and the principles of the Dao become clear.\n\nWenzi asked: How did the kings of old govern the world with the Dao?\nLaozi said: They held to the One and practiced non-action, following the transformations of Heaven and Earth. \"The world is a great vessel—it cannot be grasped or made. Those who make it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.\" Holding to the One is to perceive the small; because it is small, it can accomplish the great. Non-action is to maintain stillness; by maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in greatness, one is full yet does not overflow; dwelling in highness, one is noble yet not arrogant. Abiding in greatness without overflowing, one is full yet does not wane; dwelling above without arrogance, one is high yet not imperiled. Full yet not waning, one long preserves wealth; high yet not imperiled, one long preserves nobility. Wealth and nobility never leave one’s person, and emoluments extend to one’s descendants. The kingly Way of old was like this.\n\nLaozi said: The people have a Way they all follow and laws they all uphold. Yet righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler holds to the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Way is not for the purpose of action but for the purpose of non-action. The wise do not make virtue their affair; the brave do not use strength for violence; the benevolent do not use position for favor—this may be called holding to the One. The One is the Dao without preference, the root of the myriad things.\n\nWhen a ruler frequently changes the laws, and a state frequently changes its ruler, people use their positions to pursue their likes and dislikes. The tasks of subordinates become so numerous with fear that they cannot be managed. Thus, when a ruler loses the One, the resulting chaos is worse than having no ruler at all. Only when the ruler holds to the One can he unite the people.\n\nWenzi asked: How many are the kingly Ways?\nLaozi said: Only one.\nWenzi said: In ancient times, some kings ruled by the Dao, and some ruled by force. How can there be only one?\nLaozi said: To rule by the Dao is virtue; to rule by force is also virtue. There are five kinds of military force: righteous force, responsive force, force of anger, force of greed, and force of arrogance. To punish the violent and save the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use force, it is called responsive; to fight over trivial matters without restraining one’s heart is called anger; to covet others’ lands and desire their wealth is called greed; to rely on the size of one’s state, boast of the multitude of one’s people, and seek to be deemed worthy by enemy states is called arrogance. Righteous force brings kingship; responsive force brings victory; force of anger brings defeat; force of greed brings death; force of arrogance brings annihilation—this is the heavenly Dao.\n\nLaozi said: To abandon the Dao and rely on wisdom is perilous; to discard calculation and employ talent is to court trouble. Thus, to keep to one’s allotment and follow principle, one does not grieve over loss nor rejoice over gain. What is accomplished is not what one has done; what is obtained is not what one has sought. In receiving, there is acceptance but no taking; in giving, there is bestowal but no conferring. One follows spring to give life and autumn to bring death. Those who are given life do not feel gratitude; those who are put to death do not bear resentment—this is close to the Dao.\n\nWenzi asked: How can a ruler win the delight of the people?\nLaozi said: It is like the Yangtze and the sea: \"Bland and without flavor, yet inexhaustible in use,\" putting the small first and the great last. \"Those who wish to rise above others must humble their words; those who wish to precede others must put themselves behind.\" The world will surely emulate their delight and love, advancing their benevolence and righteousness without harshness. \"Dwelling above, the people do not find them burdensome; standing ahead, the multitude does not find them harmful. The world delights in exalting them without tiring.\" Even in distant lands and among different customs, from the smallest flying insects to the tiniest creeping things, none are not intimate. There is nowhere they do not reach, no place they do not succeed. \"Thus, they are honored by all under Heaven.\"\n\nLaozi said: To cling to the laws and records of one age and reject the customs of successive generations is like gluing the pegs of a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexibility, applying what is fitting according to the situation. When the age differs, affairs change; when the times shift, customs transform. One discusses the age to establish laws and acts according to the times.",
      "overlap_context": "s what they fear, and propriety is what they revere. These four are the proper order of culture and the means by which the sage governs all things.\n\nWhen the noble man lacks virtue, his subordinates resent him; when he lacks benevolence, they contend with him; when he lacks righteousness, they become violent; when he lacks propriety, they fall into chaos. If these four principles are not established, it is called being without the Dao. There has never been one without the Dao who did not perish.",

      "translated_text": "The kings of high antiquity had differing systems of laws and measures, not because they sought to oppose the past, but because the demands of their times varied. Thus, they did not model themselves on established laws but on the principles by which laws are made, moving in accord with transformation. The laws of the sage may be observed, but the origins of those laws cannot be traced; his words may be heeded, but the sources of those words cannot be discerned.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, regarded the myriad things as insignificant, equated life and death, and harmonized with change. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the true nature of all things, befriending the Dao above and aligning with transformation below. If one today seeks to learn their Way yet fails to attain clarity and luminosity, even if a profound sage clings to their legal codes and enforces their decrees, governance will not succeed.\n\nWenzi asked about governance.\nLaozi said: Guide them with the Dao, nurture them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not impose force. Diminish and hold to the One. Let no profit be apparent, no desire be visible. Be square without cutting, be sharp without wounding. Be neither boastful nor self-aggrandizing. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will draw near; nurture them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not impose force, and the people will remain unspoiled.\n\nNot displaying worthiness is frugality; not imposing force is restraint. Lowering oneself to gather the people, using rewards to win them, practicing frugality to preserve oneself, and exercising restraint to avoid complacency. Without lowering oneself, the people scatter; without nurturing them, they turn away. Displaying worthiness incites competition; imposing force breeds resentment. Scattering weakens the state’s power; rebellion against the ruler erodes his authority. Competition leads to disregard for wrongdoing; resentment toward superiors endangers their position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Way is nearly achieved.\n\nLaozi said: The words of superiors are put into practice by inferiors; the words of inferiors are employed by superiors. The words of superiors are consistently applied; the words of inferiors are contingently used. Only the sage can comprehend the art of contingency. To speak and invariably keep one’s word, to set expectations and invariably meet them—these are the loftiest conduct under Heaven. Yet to testify against one’s father out of rectitude, or to die for a woman out of fidelity—who would esteem such acts? Thus, the sage evaluates the right and wrong of affairs, adapting with flexibility, without fixed standards. When circumstances favor it, he is hailed as a worthy ruler; when they do not, he is seized like a father in peril. Such is the force of circumstance.\n\nContingency is how the sage alone perceives. To first oppose and later align is called contingency; to first align and later oppose is to lack contingency. Those who lack contingency turn good into evil.\n\nWenzi asked: Master, your teachings hold that without the Dao and virtue, the world cannot be governed. Yet among the kings of former ages who inherited and continued their predecessors’ legacies, some were without the Dao, yet each passed their era without calamity or ruin. By what principle was this so?\n\nLaozi said: From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own lives, yet the quality of that sustenance varies in depth. The world at times sees states perish and families collapse—this arises from the absence of the Dao and virtue. Those who rise early and retire late, ever vigilant and trembling with caution, constantly fearing peril and ruin, may yet avoid disaster. But those who indulge their desires and grow indolent will perish without warning.\n\nHad Jie and Zhou followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even if Tang and Wu were worthy, they would have had no achievements to establish. The Dao and virtue are what sustain and nourish, what foster and nurture, what engender affection and love, what inspire reverence and esteem. Even the deaf and mute, though foolish, do not harm those they love. If all the people under Heaven harbored hearts of benevolence and love, how could misfortune and disaster arise?\n\nThose who lack the Dao yet avoid harm do so because benevolence has not been extinguished and righteousness has not been obliterated. Though benevolence is not extinguished and righteousness not obliterated, if the feudal lords grow disdainful of their superiors, the court will lack reverence. If they indulge their commands and act without deference, and if benevolence is extinguished and righteousness obliterated, the feudal lords will rebel. When the multitude seizes power, the strong oppress the weak, the great encroach upon the small, and the people take attack as their profession—then disasters arise, calamities erupt, and ruin is imminent. How could they expect to avoid misfortune?\n\nLaozi said: When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people resort to deceit. When superiors are meddlesome, inferiors adopt many guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To create affairs from affairs, and then to use affairs to halt affairs, is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate trouble with cleverness, and then to guard against it with cleverness, is like stirring water and hoping for clarity.\n\nLaozi said: If a ruler favors benevolence, the undeserving are rewarded and the guilty are pardoned. If he favors punishment, the meritorious are discarded and the innocent are harmed. But one who is free from likes and dislikes metes out punishment without resentment and bestows rewards without self-congratulation. Aligning with standards and following the plumb line, he remains uninvolved in affairs, like Heaven and Earth—what does he not cover and sustain? To harmonize and unite is the role of the ruler; to distinguish and punish is the role of the law. When the people accept punishment without resentment or bitterness, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said: Right and wrong under Heaven have no fixed standard. Each age approves what it deems good and condemns what it deems bad. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but what aligns with themselves; they do not reject what is perverse but what opposes their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and abide by it, and reject what is wrong and cast it aside, I would not know what the world calls right and wrong. Thus, \"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish\"—do not stir it.\n\nThose who rush to agreement find their words well-received and their bonds strengthened, yet if their persons are distant while their plans are sound, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await the world’s response, how would I know by what standards others measure me? To run alongside the俗 is like fleeing the rain—there is no place one does not get drenched. If one’s desire lies in emptiness, one cannot attain emptiness. But to not strive for emptiness and yet become empty—this is what one desires and nothing fails to arrive.\n\nThus, one who is attuned to the Dao is like the axle of a cart: it does not move itself yet, with the wheel, travels a thousand miles, turning endlessly. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao and returns to the ultimate, not transforming to await transformation, acting without contrivance.\n\nLaozi said: Those who frequently wage war and repeatedly triumph will see their state perish. Frequent warfare exhausts the people; repeated victories make the ruler arrogant. To employ an arrogant ruler to command an exhausted people—few states do not perish.",

Now, though a worthy may possess the Dao, if he encounters an age of licentious disorder, relying on the power of one man to transform a long-corrupted people—how could this be possible?” Wenzi replied: “The virtue and power of the Dao rectify decline to restore order, rouse chaos to bring governance, and transform excess and decay to return to simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world finds peace—all hinges on one man.\n\nThe ruler is the people’s teacher; the superior is the model for those below. What the superior esteems, those below emulate; when the superior embodies the Dao, those below cultivate benevolence and righteousness.

      "translated_text": "The Power of Supreme Virtue\n\nLaozi said: The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is at peace, the hundred joints are all at rest; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred joints are all in chaos. Thus, when the body is well-governed, the limbs forget one another; when the state is well-governed, ruler and minister forget one another.\n\nLaozi studied under Chang Cong. Seeing his teacher’s tongue, he learned to embrace softness. Gazing up at the rafters and beams, he withdrew and observed the rivers, watching reflections to understand the value of holding back. Thus the sage says: “Do not cling to routine; always remain behind, never ahead.” It is like piling firewood—what is placed last ends up on top.\n\nLaozi said: The ringing bell destroys itself with its own sound; the tallow candle consumes itself with its own light. The tiger and leopard are hunted for their patterns; the swift gibbon and ape are trapped for their agility. Thus, the valiant and martial die by their strength; the eloquent and clever are ensnared by their wit.\n\nOne may use wisdom to know, but cannot use wisdom to be ignorant. Like one bold in a single skill or discerning in a single phrase—such a person may engage in subtle arguments, but cannot respond broadly. Laozi said: The Dao takes non-action as its form. Look for it and its shape cannot be seen; listen for it and its sound cannot be heard. This is called the “dark and obscure.”\n\nThe dark and obscure is how we discuss the Dao, but it is not the Dao itself. The Dao is found by looking inward and reflecting on oneself. Thus, one who does not indulge in petty learning does not fall into great delusion; one who does not settle for small cleverness does not become utterly foolish.\n\nDo not take flowing puddles as a mirror, but still water—preserving it so that it remains still and does not ripple outward. When the moon is full, the sun steals its light; yin cannot bear yang. When the sun rises, the stars are visible, yet they cannot contend with its brilliance. The branch cannot be stronger than the trunk; the twig cannot be larger than the bough. When the top is heavy and the bottom light, overturning is inevitable.\n\nA single abyss does not harbor two jiao dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. One brings stability; two bring strife. Jade lies in the mountains, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the shores do not wither. The earthworm has no strong sinews or sharp claws, yet it eats the soil above and drinks the yellow springs below—all because its mind is single.\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water can reveal the pupil of the eye. Turbidity brings harm: the waters of a river cannot reveal Mount Tai. The orchid and iris do not lose their fragrance because no one wears them; the boat does not sink in the Yangtze or the sea because no one rides it. The noble person practices the Dao not because no one knows of it and grows resentful—such is the nature of things.\n\nTo enter the turbid from the clear brings only distress and humiliation; to enter the clear from the turbid brings only ruin and collapse. When heaven’s two qi converge, a rainbow forms; when earth’s two qi converge, the hidden is released. When a person’s two qi converge, illness arises. Yin and yang cannot remain constant: the sun may be winter yet feel like summer; the moon may not know day; the sun may not know night.\n\nWhere rivers are wide, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall. Where the land is vast, virtue is profound. Thus, fish cannot be hooked without bait; beasts cannot be summoned with empty vessels. Where mountains harbor fierce beasts, the forest trees are not felled; where gardens harbor stinging insects, the mallows and beans are not plucked. Where a state has worthy ministers, they repel enemies a thousand li away.\n\nOne who is attuned to the Dao is like a wheel turning at its hub—not by one’s own effort, yet able to travel a thousand li, returning to the beginning, revolving endlessly at the source. Thus, to promote the crooked alongside the straight—how is this better than having none at all? To promote the straight alongside the crooked—do not proceed with such a course.\n\nWhen a bird is about to come, one sets out the net to await it. The bird is caught by a single mesh of the net. But if one makes a net of only a single mesh, there will never be a time to catch the bird. Thus, some affairs cannot be planned in advance; some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage nurtures the Dao and awaits the moment.\n\nIf one wishes to attract fish, first clear the valleys; if one wishes to draw birds, first plant trees. Water accumulates and fish gather; trees flourish and birds alight. To obtain fish, one does not carry them into the deep; to obtain apes, one does not carry them up the trees—simply let them follow what benefits them.\n\nWhat the feet tread upon is shallow, yet one must rely on what they do not tread upon to walk. What the mind knows is limited, yet one must rely on what it does not know to attain clarity. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when river waters run deep, their source lies in the mountains.\n\nStill water is clear; clear water is level; level water is smooth; smooth water reveals the forms of things. Forms cannot overlap, and thus can serve as a standard. The falling of leaves is caused by the wind’s shaking; the muddying of water is caused by things stirring it. The carving of jade vessels is the work of the grindstone; the sharpness of the Moye blade is the power of the whetstone.\n\nTo harness a steed to travel a thousand li without flying, to have no provisions yet not hunger—when the cunning hare is caught, the hunting dog is cooked; when the high-flying bird is gone, the fine bow is put away. One who achieves fame and success retires—such is the Way of Heaven.\n\nAnger arises from non-anger; action arises from non-action. To look upon nothingness is to obtain true sight; to listen to silence is to obtain true hearing. Birds fly back to their native land; hares run to their burrows; foxes die with their heads toward the hills; cicadas cling to their native trees—each returns to where it was born.\n\nWater and fire are enemies, yet when a cauldron stands between them, the five flavors harmonize. Bones and flesh love one another, yet when slanderers intervene, father and son endanger each other. Dogs and pigs eat from any vessel and grow fat, hastening their death. The phoenix soars a thousand fathoms high—none can reach it.\n\nThe pestle can pound within a mortar yet cannot pound itself; the eye can see a hundred paces away yet cannot see its own lashes.

      "translated_text": "Silk may become fine white silk—some is made into caps, some into shoes. The cap is worn on the head, while the shoe is trodden underfoot. Metal’s power overcomes wood, yet a single blade cannot fell a whole forest; earth’s power overcomes water, yet a handful cannot dam rivers and seas; water’s power overcomes fire, yet a single ladle cannot quench a cartload of kindling.\n\nIn winter there is thunder, in summer there is hail; cold and heat do not alter their seasons. Frost and snow glisten, yet at sunrise they melt and flow. What is tilted is easily overturned, what leans is easily toppled; a stool is easily moved, what is damp is easily rained upon. Orchids and angelica are fragrant, yet they cannot endure frost. When the toad smears its venom on weapons, their potency lasts until the full moon of the fifth month. Those who dissipate their essence are easily broken; blossoms that bloom out of season cannot be eaten.\n\nBetween the tongue and the teeth, which wears out first? Between the carpenter’s line and the arrow, which is straighter? What makes a shadow crooked is the form; what makes an echo muddy is the sound. One afflicted with the same illness as the dead is no good physician; one who follows the same path as a ruined state cannot offer loyal counsel.\n\nLet a musician blow the *yu*, let a craftsman cover the finger-holes—though the notes be in tune, they cannot be used to make decisions, for the ruler’s form is absent. The deaf do not sing, for they cannot delight themselves; the blind do not gaze, for they cannot engage with things.\n\nOne who walks through a forest cannot take the straight path; one who travels through peril cannot tread a tightrope. What the land produces determines its greatness. The sun does not rise twice, the fox does not have two males, the divine dragon does not pair, fierce beasts do not herd, birds of prey do not mate—just as a roof beam cannot block the sun, nor a wheel’s hub match the speed of its spokes, yet neither beam nor hub is sufficient on its own.\n\nA bow may shoot, but without the string it cannot loose; the loosing of the arrow is but one-tenth of the shot. A hungry horse in the stable lies silent, but when fodder is cast beside it, the urge to compete arises.\n\nA three-inch tube without a base cannot be filled, even by all under heaven; but with a ten-*dan* vessel that has a stopper, a hundred bamboo stalks suffice. Cutting along a line does not exceed the mark; weighing with a balance does not err. Following ancient models by category may sometimes succeed, but if one wields the staff and cangue at will, or acts by whim, it is called chaos.\n\nThe farmer toils while the gentleman is nourished; the fool speaks while the wise choose. What is seen clearly is handled like jade and stone; what is seen dimly must be pondered. The brightness of a hundred stars does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows thrown open do not match the light of one door.\n\nThe viper cannot be given feet, nor the tiger wings. Now, a six-foot span: lying down, even the mediocre can cross it; standing upright, even the talented find it difficult—such is the difference in circumstances.\n\nThose who assist at sacrifices may taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights may be wounded. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites a thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon wish to shine, but murky clouds cover them; the river wishes to run clear, but sand and soil defile it; the lush orchid wishes to flourish, but autumn winds ruin it; human nature wishes to be balanced, but desires harm it. Covered in dust, one cannot avoid getting grit in the eye—purity is unattainable.\n\nA golden tortoise-knob sash is worn by the worthy as an ornament; soil spread upon the earth makes the capable rich. Thus, giving gold and jade to the weak is not as good as giving them a foot of plain silk.\n\nA wheel’s hub is hollow, standing at the center of thirty spokes—each does its part. If one spoke alone were forced in, the rest would all be abandoned; how then could near and far be reached?\n\nOranges and pomelos have their regions, reeds and rushes have their thickets. Beasts with the same feet flock together; birds with the same wings soar together.\n\nTo survey the lands of the Nine Provinces without traveling a thousand *li*, or to rule over the myriad people without the foundation of governance and teaching—this is difficult indeed!\n\nThe fierce are hunted, the haughty are shot. Thus, great whiteness appears tarnished, and abundant virtue seems insufficient.\n\nWhen the gentleman has wine, the petty man beats the jar—though it cannot be called fine, it need not be called shameful. Human nature finds silk and hemp comfortable; yet when arrows fly, one dons armor—what is inconvenient is done for the sake of convenience.\n\nThirty spokes share a single hub, each aligned with its own mortise, none able to intrude upon another—just as ministers each guard their own duties.\n\nOne who uses others well is like the feet of a tripod: many yet not in conflict, or like the tongue and teeth: hard and soft grinding without harming each other.\n\nStone is born hard, angelica is born fragrant; what is possessed in youth grows ever clearer with age.\n\nSupporting and lifting, declining and yielding, gaining and losing, assenting and refusing—these differ by a thousand *li*. What is reborn does not bear fruit; blossoms that bloom too early wither without waiting for frost.\n\nIf one dirties one’s level, powders one’s forehead, places a rotting rat on the threshold, and burns it in the hall—entering water only to get wet, or seeking fragrance while carrying stench—even the skilled cannot be called craftsmen.\n\nWinter ice can be broken, summer wood can be knotted; time is hard to gain and easy to lose.\n\nWhen a tree is in full leaf, plucking it all day only makes it grow back; but when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night.\n\nA target is set up, and arrows gather; a forest grows thick, and axes enter—not because they are summoned, but because the circumstances compel it.\n\nA nursing pup may bite a tiger; a brooding hen may strike a fox—where affection is applied, strength is not measured.\n\nThose who wait for profit before rescuing the drowning will themselves be drowned; a boat can float or sink, but the fool does not know when to stop.\n\nA fine steed may not advance when driven, nor stop when pulled—yet a ruler does not measure the Way by *li*.\n\nThough water is level, it must have waves; though a balance is true, it must have discrepancies; though a ruler is straight, it must have flaws. Without compass and square, circles and squares cannot be set; without level and line, curves and straightness cannot be corrected. Yet even those who use compass and square must have the mind of compass and square.\n\nThe height of Mount Tai, doubled, cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair can be examined. Bamboo and wood contain fire, but without drilling, no smoke arises; earth contains water, but without digging, none emerges.\n\nAn arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*; yet half-steps unceasingly taken carry the lame turtle a thousand *li*. Piling earth without cease forms hills and mountains.",

      "translated_text": "Standing by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning home to weave a net.\n\nA bow must first be tuned before seeking strength; a horse must first be docile before seeking excellence; a person must first be trustworthy before seeking ability.\n\nA skilled smelter cannot melt wood; a master craftsman cannot carve ice—there are things that cannot be done, so why does the noble person not take heed?\n\nOne may prevent people from crossing the river, but one cannot prevent the river from having waves.\n\nWithout the moon’s fault, the steamer will never fall into the well.\n\nThose who criticize my conduct seek my friendship; those who disparage my goods seek my trade. Playing a single move in chess is not enough to reveal understanding; plucking a single string is not enough to express sorrow.\n\nNow if a single burning coal is picked up, it chars the hand; when placed near others, ten thousand bushels are all scorched. Yet at ten paces away, it brings death—same qi, different accumulation.\n\nWhere there is glory, there must be sorrow; where there is fine silk above, there must be coarse hemp below. The larger the tree, the deeper its roots; the higher the mountain, the broader its base.\n\nLaozi said: A drum does not store sound, yet it can produce sound; a mirror does not conceal form, yet it can reflect form. Metal and stone have voices, but without movement, they do not ring; pipes and flutes have tones, but without blowing, there is no sound.\n\nThus the sage conceals within and does not initiate for things. When affairs come, they are managed; when things arrive, they are responded to.\n\nThe heavens move without cease, ending and then beginning again—thus they endure long. A wheel returns to where it turns—thus it travels far. The heavens’ movement never errs—thus there is no fault.\n\nHeaven’s qi descends; earth’s qi ascends. Yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are as one. When the noble person acts, the petty person vanishes—this is the Way of heaven and earth.\n\nIf heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, yin and yang do not communicate, and the myriad things do not flourish. When petty persons gain power and noble persons vanish, the five grains are not planted, and virtue and power are concealed within.\n\nThe Way of heaven reduces the full and augments the deficient; the Way of earth reduces the high and augments the low. The Way of ghosts and spirits humbles the arrogant and aids the lowly; the Way of humans does not aid the many. The Way of the sage is lowly, and none can surpass it.\n\nWhen the heavens are bright and clear, they can then illuminate the four directions. When the ruler is enlightened and the ministers are enlightened, the realm is at peace. With these four enlightened, one can endure long. To enlighten what is already enlightened is to enlighten its transformation.\n\nThe Way of heaven is measure; the Way of earth is principle. Harmony is made of unity, and time is its agent—thus the myriad things are completed. This is called the Way.\n\nThe great Way is level and broad, not far from the self. Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in things, and its virtue does not cease.\n\nHeaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nourish them. It gives but does not take—thus spirit returns to it. To give without taking is the highest virtue, and thus it possesses virtue.\n\nNothing is higher than heaven; nothing is lower than the marsh. Heaven is high and the marsh is low—thus the sage models them. With hierarchy and order, the world is settled.\n\nEarth bears the myriad things and makes them grow. It gives and takes—thus bones and skeletons return to it. To give and take is lesser virtue. “Lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it has no virtue.”\n\nEarth supports heaven, thus it is stable and peaceful. When earth is stable and peaceful, the myriad things take form. Earth is vast and thick—thus the myriad things gather. Stable and peaceful, it bears all; vast and thick, it contains all. Earth’s terrain is deep and thick—thus water springs gather within. Earth’s Way is square and broad—thus it endures long. The sage models this, and virtue contains all.\n\nWhen yin yields to yang, the myriad things flourish; when yang submits to yin, the myriad things are still. When things flourish, none are lacking; when things are still, none are unhappy. When things are happy, none are ungoverned.\n\nYin harms things; yang humbles itself. When yin advances and yang retreats, petty persons gain power, and noble persons avoid harm—this is the Way of heaven.\n\nWhen yang qi moves, the myriad things relax and find their place. Thus the sage follows the yang Way. One who follows things is followed by things; one who opposes things is opposed by things—thus one does not lose the nature of things.\n\nWhen wetlands are full, the myriad things mature in season; when wetlands dry up, the myriad things lack nurture. Thus when rain and moisture do not flow, the world becomes barren.\n\nYang rises and then returns below—thus it is the master of the myriad things. It does not long possess, thus it can end and begin again. Ending and beginning again, it can endure long. Able to endure long, it is the mother of the world.\n\nYang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who could transform without accumulation—thus the sage is cautious about what is accumulated.\n\nWhen yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow fat; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Thus when kings and lords esteem the yang Way, the myriad things flourish; when they esteem the yin Way, the world perishes.\n\nIf yang does not descend to yin, the myriad things do not form; if the ruler does not descend to the ministers, virtue and transformation do not spread. Thus when the ruler descends to the ministers, there is clarity; when the ruler does not descend, there is darkness and deafness.\n\nWhen the sun emerges from the earth, the myriad things multiply; when kings and lords stand above the people, they illuminate virtue and power. When the sun enters the earth, the myriad things rest; when petty persons stand above the people, the myriad things flee and hide.\n\nWhen thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The actions of great persons resemble this. The movement of yin and yang has constant rhythm; the actions of great persons do not exhaust things.\n\nWhen thunder shakes the earth, the myriad things relax; when wind sways the trees, grasses and trees wither. When great persons remove evil and pursue good, the people do not wander far. Thus the people have departures and arrivals—departures are not extreme, and arrivals are ever more numerous.\n\nWhen wind does not move, fire does not arise; when great persons do not speak, petty persons have nothing to recount. Fire’s arising must await kindling; the words of great persons must have trust. With trust and truth, what cannot be accomplished?\n\nWhen river waters are deep, soil is in the mountains; when hills and mounds are high, they descend into the abyss.

The noble person strives diligently to achieve brilliance, while the petty person hastens recklessly to invite disgrace. Though their waxing and waning may not be visible, thus they see goodness as if it were not yet attained, and past evils as if they were ill-omened.*\n\nIf one turns toward good, even if they err, there will be no blame. If one does not turn toward good, though they come with loyalty, they will bring evil. Hence, blaming others is not as good as blaming oneself. Exerting oneself for others is not as effective as exerting oneself for oneself.\n\nSound is summoned by oneself, kindred is sought by oneself, name is given by oneself, fate is shaped by oneself. Those without self-blame wield sharp words to pierce, and sharp blades to strike—why blame others? Thus, the noble person is cautious of trifles.\n\nAll things bear yin while embracing yang, and their clashing qi produces harmony.

      "translated_text": "The Master said: *\"Now, those who pull the cart—when the leader calls ‘hey!’ at the front, those behind respond in kind. This is the song of the cart-pullers, urging them to exert their strength. Even the music of Zheng and Wei, or the Hu and Chu, cannot match its purpose.*\n\n*To govern a state lies in ritual, not in eloquence. ‘When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits multiply.’*\n\n*The Dao has no fixed form yet can be made the standard; like mountains and forests, it can be made into timber. Timber cannot encompass mountains and forests, mountains and forests cannot encompass clouds and rain, clouds and rain cannot encompass yin and yang, yin and yang cannot encompass harmony, and harmony cannot encompass the Dao. The Dao is ‘that which has no form yet is the form of all things, no image yet is the image of all things.’ Without comprehending its intent, all between heaven and earth can be shaped and transformed.*\n\n*The Sage establishes teachings and governs, ever mindful of their beginning and end, seeing how blessings are bestowed. Thus, when people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know mechanisms, substance declines. A zither need not be struck for its twenty-five strings to each sound in response; a wheel need not be turned by itself for its thirty spokes to each exert their force in rotation. Strings must have tension and slackness to form melody; wheels must have labor and rest to travel far. What makes sound is itself without sound; what makes turning is itself without turning.*\n\n*When superiors and inferiors follow different Ways, ease in governance leads to chaos. Those in high station with great Way follow fortune; those in great affairs with small Way meet ruin. Minor virtue harms righteousness, minor goodness harms the Way, minor eloquence harms governance, and harshness injures virtue. The most upright is not rigid, so the people are easily guided. In perfect governance, ease prevails, so the lower ranks do not rebel. In supreme loyalty, simplicity returns, so the people harbor no deceit or concealment.*\n\n*The Master said: When laws of mutual punishment are established, the people resent them; when decrees to reduce titles are issued, loyal ministers rebel. Thus, those who scrutinize legal records do not know the roots of order and chaos, and those skilled in military formations do not grasp the strategies of temple warfare. The Sage first secures blessings within the pass, and considers calamities beyond the unseen. The foolish are dazzled by small gains and forget great harm, so there are actions beneficial in the short term but ruinous in the long, gains here but losses there. Thus, no love is greater than loving others, no wisdom greater than knowing others. Loving others means no resentment of punishment; knowing others means no chaos in governance.*\n\n*The Master said: Though the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers are vast, their floods subside within three days. Violent winds and torrential rains cease within moments. He who accumulates no virtue yet fears no want is doomed to meet it. Worry is the path to flourishing; delight is the path to ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, transform misfortune into blessing. The Dao is empty yet never full.*\n\n*The Master said: Serenity and tranquility are human nature; propriety and measure are the rules of conduct. Knowing human nature, one nurtures oneself without contradiction; knowing the rules of conduct, one acts without disorder. A single command disperses without rivalry; a unified principle governs all—this is called *heart*. To see the root and know the branches, to grasp one and respond to ten thousand—this is called *technique*. To act knowing one’s purpose, to move knowing one’s destination, to undertake knowing one’s means, to stop knowing one’s limit—this is called the *Way*.*\n\n*To make others exalt and praise you is the power of the heart; to make others belittle and slander you is the fault of the heart. Words once spoken cannot be recalled by others; deeds once begun cannot be restrained from afar. Affairs are difficult to complete but easy to ruin; reputation is difficult to establish but easy to lose. All people neglect minor harms and trifling matters until they become calamities. Calamity arises from within; blessing is self-made. Calamity and blessing share a gate; profit and harm are neighbors. Without the utmost discernment, none can distinguish them. Thus, wise deliberation is the threshold of calamity and blessing; action and stillness are the pivot of profit and harm—one must not fail to examine them carefully.*\n\n*The Master said: All know the mechanisms of order and chaos, yet none know how to preserve life entirely. Thus, the Sage assesses the times and acts accordingly, weighs circumstances and plans accordingly. The Sage can be yin or yang, soft or hard, weak or strong, adapting to the times in motion and stillness, leveraging resources to achieve deeds. Seeing things as they go, one knows their return; observing one thing, one perceives its variations. When transformed, it takes form; when in motion, it responds. Thus, throughout life, one acts without constraint.*\n\n*There are things that can be spoken but not done, things that can be done but not spoken, things easy to begin but hard to complete, things hard to complete but easy to ruin. What can be done but not spoken is *taking and discarding*; what can be spoken but not done is *deceit and falsehood*; what is easy to begin but hard to complete is *affairs*; what is hard to complete but easy to ruin is *reputation*. These four are what the Sage attends to, what the enlightened alone perceive.*\n\n*The Master said: The Way is to revere the subtle, act without transgression, and guard against a hundred dangers with repeated warnings. Then calamity will not fester. In calculating blessings, do not overreach; in considering calamity, exceed it. Like the sun and moon in the sky, those obscured are not harmed. The foolish, with preparation, match the wise in achievement.*\n\n*Accumulated love brings blessing; accumulated hatred brings calamity. All know how to avert disaster, yet none know how to prevent it from arising. Preventing disaster from arising is easy; remedying it is difficult. Now people do not strive to prevent disaster but only to remedy it—even the divine cannot devise such strategies. The origins of calamity are countless and boundless. The Sage retreats in seclusion to avoid disaster, remains silent and waits for the time. The petty, unaware of the gates of calamity and blessing, act and fall into punishment. Though they contrive every precaution, it is insufficient to shield their bodies.*\n\n*Thus, the superior person first avoids calamity and then seeks gain, first shuns disgrace and then pursues reputation. The Sage always attends to what is formless, not lingering on what is already manifest. Therefore, calamity and blame have no path to reach him; praise cannot soil him.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: **\"The Way of the common person**—let the heart be small, the will great, the wisdom comprehensive, the conduct upright, the capabilities many, and the undertakings few.\n\nWhat is meant by *‘let the heart be small’*? To anticipate misfortune before it arises, to guard against calamity in its subtlest forms, and to never dare indulge desire.\n\n*‘Let the will be great’*—to encompass all under heaven, to harmonize disparate customs, to gather all judgments toward a central truth.\n\n*‘Wisdom comprehensive’*—to have no beginning or end, to flow in all directions like the four seas, to be a boundless spring that never runs dry.\n\n*‘Conduct upright’*—to stand firm and unyielding, to remain pure and unstained, to remain steadfast in adversity and not to boast in prosperity.\n\n*‘Capabilities many’*—to possess both literary and martial arts, to move and rest in perfect measure, to act and rest in accordance with what is fitting.\n\n*‘Undertakings few’*—to grasp the essential and pair it with the multitude, to hold fast to simplicity and govern the broad, to remain still and steady the restless.\n\nThus, the one whose heart is small **restrains at the outset**; the one whose will is great **embraces all**; the one whose wisdom is comprehensive **knows all**; the one whose conduct is upright **has nothing to do**; the one whose capabilities are many **governs all**; the one whose undertakings are few **holds fast to the essential**.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, when it comes to virtue, does nothing small that he does not practice; when it comes to fault, he does not overlook even the slightest. His actions do not rely on shamans or sorcerers, yet ghosts and spirits dare not act before him—this is true nobility. Yet he trembles and fears daily, ever cautious, and thus achieves unity through non-action.\n\nThe fool’s wisdom is already scant, yet the deeds he undertakes are many—thus, every move he makes leads to exhaustion. Therefore, to govern with proper teaching is easy and certain to succeed; to govern with perverse teaching is difficult and certain to fail. To abandon what is easy and certain to succeed, and instead engage in what is difficult and certain to fail—this is the folly of delusion.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Blessing arises softly and steadily, while calamity bursts forth in chaos. The patterns of blessing and calamity are subtle and unseen, yet the Sage perceives their beginning and end—thus, they must be observed.**\n\nThe wise ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself, but for the state. What benefits himself but not the state shall not be rewarded; what harms himself but benefits the state shall not be punished.\n\nThus, to uphold what is fitting is called a *junzi*; to abandon what is fitting is called a petty person.\n\nTo grasp intelligence without labor is best; next is to labor without illness; worst is to be ill without labor. The ancients savored without abandoning; the present age abandons without savoring.\n\nZhou’s *xiàngliè* (ritual wine vessel) caused Ji Zi to sigh, and the Ru’s burial of a dummy figure made Confucius lament—seeing their beginnings, one knows their ends.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Ren is what people admire, and *yì* is what people revere. To be admired and revered, yet sometimes meet with death and the ruin of one’s state—this is failing to align with the times. Thus, one who knows *yì* but not the power of the age does not grasp the Dao.\n\nThe Five Emperors valued *de*, the Three Kings relied on *yì*, the Five Hegemons depended on force. To take the Dao of the emperors and apply it in the age of the hegemons is not the proper way.\n\nThus, good and evil, praise and blame, popularity and unpopularity, all follow the same paths of right and wrong, left and right.\n\nTo know the workings of Heaven and the actions of humanity is to have the means to govern the world.\n\nTo know Heaven but not humanity is to lack the means to interact with the world; to know humanity but not Heaven is to lack the means to align with the Dao.\n\nTo follow one’s will and gratify one’s desires is to be enslaved by the strong; to make one’s body serve others is to be consumed by yin and yang.\n\nThe one who attains the Dao transforms outwardly but not inwardly. Outward transformation is how one knows humanity; inward non-transformation is how one preserves oneself. Thus, inwardly, one maintains a fixed principle, while outwardly, one bends and extends, moving with things. In all actions, one does not fall—what is precious in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation.\n\nTo uphold one principle and extend one action, even if fully realized, is still not easy. To cling to minor virtues while blocking the Great Dao—\n\nThe Dao is silent and empty, non-doing toward things, non-attachment to oneself. Thus, to act in accordance with the Dao is not the doing of one who does not know the Dao, but the Dao’s own unfolding.\n\nWhat Heaven and Earth cover and load, what the sun and moon illuminate, what yin and yang nourish, what rain and dew moisten, what *de* sustains—all are in harmony as one word.\n\nThus, the one who wears the great roundness walks the great square, the one who mirrors great clarity sees great brightness, the one who stands in great peace dwells in the great hall. The one who wanders in the murky depths shines with the sun and moon, manifesting the formless within the formed. Therefore, the True Person rests his hopes on the *língtái* (spiritual platform) and returns to the origin of things, gazing into the murky depths, listening to the soundless—within the murky depths, there is alone clarity; within the silent void, there is alone illumination.\n\nIts use is in non-use; only in non-use can one truly use it. Its knowing is in non-knowing; only in non-knowing can one truly know it.\n\nThe Dao is the path of all things; *de* is the support of life; *rén* is the proof of accumulated kindness; *yì* is what aligns with the heart and suits the multitude.\n\nWhen the Dao fades, *de* flourishes; in the middle age, *de* is upheld but not cherished; in the later age, *rén* is stringently enforced, as if fearing its loss.\n\nThus, the *junzi* has no means to live without *yì*; to lose *yì* is to lose the means to live. The petty person has no means to live without profit; to lose profit is to lose the means to live. Thus, the *junzi* fears losing *yì*, the petty person fears losing profit—observe what they fear, and their blessings and calamities differ.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Sometimes, to seek profit harms; harming is what truly profits. To feed a feverish patient with rich food, to give cold water to a thirsty one—this is how the common crowd nurtures illness, while the skilled physician does the opposite.\n\nWhat pleases the eyes, what pleases the heart—this is what the foolish Dao profits from, yet what the one who knows the Dao avoids.\"**",

      "translated_text": "The Sage first diverges and then harmonizes; the common crowd first harmonizes and then diverges. Therefore, the gates of calamity and blessing, the reversal of benefit and harm, cannot be overlooked.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Those with merit who abandon virtue and righteousness will be met with suspicion; those with guilt who uphold virtue and righteousness will be trusted. Thus, virtue and righteousness are the constant path of proper conduct, the esteemed rank of the world. Though plans and strategies may be sound, if actions stray from virtue and righteousness, their merit will not be fulfilled. Though words may lack precision in policy, if their intent is loyal and their counsel benefits the state, yet their heart is devoted to the ruler and aligned with virtue and righteousness, their life will be preserved. Therefore, it is said: 'Even if one’s words and plans are always wrong, it is better to abandon them and carefully uphold virtue and righteousness.'\n\nLaozi said: 'Teaching originates from the *junzi*; the petty person benefits from its influence. Profit originates from the petty person; the *junzi* enjoys its merit. If the *junzi* and petty person each find their proper place, then governance becomes effortless and the Dao is realized. People who desire much will harm virtue; those who worry much will impair wisdom. Therefore, in governing a state—what brings joy ensures survival, what brings sorrow leads to ruin.\n\nWater flows downward, vast and expansive; the ruler submits to ministers, wise and discerning. If the ruler does not contend with ministers, the Way of governance flows smoothly. Thus, the ruler is the root and foundation, the ministers are branches and leaves. If the root is not flourishing yet the branches are lush, such a thing has never existed.\n\nLaozi said: 'The loving kindness of a benevolent father toward his child is not sought for its return; it cannot be resolved within the heart. The nurturing of a wise sovereign toward the people is not for the sake of scholars; it is the nature of things, inevitable. But if one relies on their strength and exploits their merits, they will inevitably reach ruin, and those who depend on them will find their favor does not extend.\n\nThus, if one employs what the common people love, they will gain the common people’s strength; if one raises what the common people delight in, they will win the common people’s hearts. Therefore, observe their beginning, and you will know their end.\n\nLaozi said: 'People are bound by virtue; factions are strengthened by cliques. Thus, if the scope of what is granted is broad, the influence of what is enforced will be far-reaching. If virtue is applied thinly, the force of what is restrained will be small.\n\nLaozi said: 'If one gains through unrighteousness and does not distribute it, misfortune will befall them. They cannot benefit others, nor themselves—this can be called a foolish person, no different from the owl that loves its young. Therefore, it is said: *\"Clutching and hoarding cannot compare to letting go; probing and scheming cannot endure long.\"* Virtue and the Dao are intertwined; the Dao and virtue are inseparable. Their transformations are boundless. Within the bright is the dark; within the dark is the bright. All things follow this pattern, beyond measure.\n\nBlessings come with auspicious signs; calamities precede with omens. If one sees auspicious signs yet does not act virtuously, blessings will not arrive. If one sees inauspicious signs yet acts virtuously, calamities will not befall. Benefit and harm share the same threshold; calamity and blessing are neighbors. Only the divine and the Sage can distinguish them. Therefore, it is said: *\"Calamity, oh calamity, is the foundation of blessing; blessing, oh blessing, is the seed of calamity—who can know their limits?\"*\n\nWhen people are about to fall ill, they first crave the taste of fish and meat. When a state is about to fall, it first despises the words of loyal ministers. Thus, the dying cannot be healed by a skilled physician, nor can a doomed state be saved by loyal counsel.\n\nCultivate oneself first, then one can govern the people. Manage one’s household properly, then one can be entrusted with official duties. Therefore, it is said: *\"Cultivate oneself, and one’s virtue becomes genuine; cultivate one’s household, and one’s virtue has surplus; cultivate one’s state, and one’s virtue becomes abundant.\"*\n\nThe people’s means of survival are clothing and food. If matters concerning clothing and food are well attended, there will be merit; if neglected, there will be none. Matters without merit cannot endure long.\n\nThus, if one follows the times yet does not succeed, do not alter the laws. If one conforms to the times yet does not succeed, do not change the principles. When the times shift again, this is called the rhythm of the Dao.\n\nThe Emperor enriches his people; the King enriches his land. A ruler in peril enriches his officials; a well-governed state seems lacking in wealth. A ruined state has empty granaries. Therefore, it is said: *\"When the ruler has no affairs, the people naturally prosper; when the ruler does nothing, the people naturally transform.\"*\n\nRaising an army of ten thousand men, daily expenditures of a thousand gold—*\"After the campaign’s return, there will surely be a year of misfortune.\"* Thus, it is said: *\"Warfare is an inauspicious instrument; it is not the treasure of the *junzi*.\"* *\"Conciliating great grudges will surely leave lingering grudges,\"*—how can this be considered good?\n\nIn ancient times, those who were close were not treated differently by speech; those who were distant were not treated differently by speech. The near were made to delight, the distant were made to come.\n\nIf one shares the people’s desires, harmony will follow; if one shares the people’s safeguards, stability will follow; if one shares the people’s thoughts, wisdom will follow. Those who gain the people’s strength will be rich; those who gain the people’s praise will be honored. Actions invite enemies; words bring calamity. Do not speak before others; speak after others have spoken.\n\nWhispered words may spread a thousand miles. The speaker invites calamity; the tongue is a mechanism. If words are spoken inappropriately, not even four horses can outrun their consequences.\n\nOnce, Zhonghuangzi said: *\"Heaven has five directions, Earth has five phases, sound has five tones, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and people have five stations. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, there are twenty-five kinds of people.\n\nThe highest five are the divine person, the true person, the Dao person, the perfect person, and the Sage. The next five are the virtuous person, the worthy person, the wise person, the good person, and the eloquent person. The middle five are the upright person, the loyal person, the trustworthy person, the righteous person, and the ceremonious person. The next five are the scholar, the artisan, the hunter, the farmer, and the merchant. The lowest five are the common person, the slave, the foolish person, the brute, and the petty person. The highest five and the lowest five differ as much as people differ from cattle and horses.\n\nThe Sage observes with the eyes, listens with the ears, speaks with the mouth, and acts with the feet.\n\nThe True person does not observe yet is clear, does not listen yet is discerning, does not act yet is followed, does not speak yet is upright.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "g *yì*, the petty person fears losing profit—observe what they fear, and their blessings and calamities differ.\n\nLaozi said: **\"Sometimes, to seek profit harms; harming is what truly profits. To feed a feverish patient with rich food, to give cold water to a thirsty one—this is how the common crowd nurtures illness, while the skilled physician does the opposite.\n\nWhat pleases the eyes, what pleases the heart—this is what the foolish Dao profits from, yet what the one who knows the Dao avoids.\"**",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Sage moves the world through his virtue, yet the True Person has never surpassed him. The worthy person corrects the common customs, yet the Sage has never observed them.\n\nThe so-called **Dao/Way** is without before or after, without left or right. All things merge in mysterious unity, neither affirming nor denying.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Naturalness**\nLaozi says: **\"Qīngxū** [purity and emptiness] is the clarity of Heaven, **wúwéi** [non-action] is the constant of governance. To abandon favor and wisdom, discard the virtues of the worthy and the cunning of the Sage, forsake skillful talents, reject benevolence and righteousness, extinguish old customs, abandon artful persuasion, and suppress deceit—then the worthy and the unworthy alike will align with the Dao.\n\n**Stillness brings unity; emptiness brings harmony.** The ultimate **virtue/power** is **non-action**, yet all things find their place. The Dao of **emptiness and stillness** endures as vast as Heaven and enduring as Earth, its subtlety infinite and overflowing, yet it does not dominate any thing.\n\nThe twelve months move in cycles, returning without end. **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth**—their forces oppose yet their **Dao/Way** complements each other. So extreme cold harms things, yet without cold, it would be impossible. Extreme heat harms things, yet without heat, it would be impossible. Thus, what is possible and what is impossible both arise from possibility, hence the great **Dao/Way** has no absolute impossibility. It lies in its **lǐ** [principle/reason], seeing what is possible yet not rushing toward it, seeing what is impossible yet not avoiding it. What is possible and what is impossible are like the left and right, the exterior and interior of each other.\n\nThe essence of all things must begin with **one**; time serves as its measure. From ancient times to the present, it has never altered or changed—this is called **Heavenly lǐ**. Above, it holds the great clarity; below, it utilizes its radiance. The **Dao/Way** gives birth to all things, its **lǐ** rests in **Yīnyáng** [yin-yang], its transformation becomes the four seasons, its division the five phases. Each finds its place, moving with the times, yet its laws remain constant. Even the lowliest of beings conforms, while the **Dao/Way** itself remains uninclined. When all ministers are of one mind, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth is **non-action** yet complete, **non-seeking** yet fulfilled. *\"Hence one knows its benefit lies in non-action.\"*\n\nLaozi says: **\"Pǔ** [uncarved simplicity], the greatest of all, has no form; the **Dao/Way**, the greatest of all, has no measure. Thus, Heaven’s compass is not bound by the circle, Earth’s square is not confined by the rule. The past and present are called **zhòu** [duration], the four directions and above and below are called **yǔ** [space]. The **Dao/Way** dwells in the midst yet is unknown in its location. Thus, those who see not far cannot be spoken to of the great, those who know not broadly cannot be instructed on the ultimate.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** that communicates with all things cannot be contradicted. Hence the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, though their laws and systems varied by region, all won the hearts of the people in the same way.\n\nIf one speaks of **rulers and measures, hooks and cords**—these are tools of craft, yet not the essence of craft. Thus, even with a master, a stringless instrument cannot produce its melody, and a lone string cannot weep alone. The string is but the tool for weeping, not the weeping itself.\n\nWhen **shén** [spirit] and **hé** [harmony] are achieved, they play between the heart and hands. To let the mind wander freely and express the **spirit** through the strings, to discuss love yet reveal it in the music—this is a **Dao/Way** that cannot be taught. A father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the **Dao/Way** that does not transmit.\n\nThus, **sù** [solemnity] is the sovereign of form, while **jìmiào** [silence and solitude] is the master of sound.\n\nLaozi says: The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth is rooted in **virtue/power**, the **Dao/Way** itself is its command, and all things regulate themselves.\n\nThe most subtle and profound does not serve the noble, hence it does not await merit to establish itself, nor does it rely on rank for its honor, nor does it seek reputation for its brilliance, nor does it need ceremony for its dignity, nor does it employ force for its strength. Thus, the **Dao/Way** stands yet does not instruct, its clarity shines yet does not scrutinize. The **Dao/Way** stands yet does not instruct, for it does not usurp others’ abilities; its clarity shines yet does not scrutinize, for it does not harm their undertakings.\n\nTo teach the **Dao/Way** is to go against **virtue/power**, to harm all things. Hence **Yīnyáng** and the four seasons, **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth**—though they share the same **Dao/Way**, their **lǐ** differs. All things share the same **qíng** [emotion], yet their forms vary.\n\nThe wise do not instruct each other, the skilled do not take from each other. Thus the Sage establishes laws to guide the hearts of the people, letting each follow their nature. Hence the living have no grievance, the dead no resentment.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat all things as **chúdài** [sacrificial cattle]. The Sage is not benevolent; he treats the people as **chúdài**. Benevolence, love, and righteousness are narrow **Dao/Way**s. The narrow cannot enter the great without confusion, the near cannot travel far without doubt. The **Dao/Way** of the Sage enters the great without confusion, travels far without doubt. He constantly guards himself in **emptiness**, and thus can attain the utmost—this is called **Heavenly virtue/power**.\n\nLaozi says: The Sage is covered by Heaven, borne by Earth, illuminated by the sun and moon. **Yīnyáng** harmonizes, the four seasons transform, yet he embraces all things without distinction. He neither clings to the old nor pursues the new, neither shuns the distant nor favors the near. Thus, those who can follow Heaven’s **Dao/Way** know that Heaven does not adhere to a single time, Earth does not limit itself to one material, and people do not pursue one path. Hence their undertakings are manifold, their actions diverse.\n\nThus, those who use arms may be **light or heavy**, **greedy or restrained**—these four are contrary, and cannot be unified. The **light** may be ordered to advance, yet they cannot be commanded to hold firm; the **heavy** may be ordered to defend, yet they cannot be commanded to assail. The **greedy** may be ordered to take, yet they cannot be commanded to distribute wealth; the **restrained** may be ordered to keep their share, yet they cannot be commanded to advance. The **trustworthy** may be ordered to keep their oaths, yet they cannot be commanded to adapt to change. These five, the Sage employs them all yet measures their use.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not cherish any single thing, **Yīnyáng** does not favor any single type. Thus the sea does not refuse the smallest streams to become great, the mountains and forests do not reject the crooked and bent to become lofty. The Sage does not reject the humble words of a woodcutter to broaden his name.\n\nTo guard one corner while abandoning the world, to take one thing while discarding the rest—then what is gained is few, and what is governed is shallow.\n\nLaozi says: What Heaven covers and Earth bears, what the sun and moon illuminate—though their forms differ and their natures vary, each finds its own repose. Joy is the means of joy, yet it is also the means of sorrow. Safety is the means of safety, yet it is also the means of danger.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage governs the people by allowing each to follow its nature, to dwell in comfort, to engage in what they are capable of, to fulfill their proper roles, and to act according to what is fitting. Thus all things harmonize, and none overstep their bounds.\n\nAll things under Heaven have neither nobility nor lowliness—what is valued is valued because of its worth, and all things are thus worthy; what is demeaned is demeaned because of its lack, and all things are thus unworthy. Therefore, the Sage does not exalt the worthy, nor does he cast fish upon trees or drown birds in the deep.\n\nIn ancient times, when Emperor Yao ruled the world, Shun was Minister of Instruction, Xiè was Minister of War, Yǔ was Minister of Works, Hòuxī was Overseer of Agriculture, Xī Zhòng was Master of Crafts. In guiding the people, those dwelling by water fished, those dwelling in forests gathered, those dwelling in valleys herded, and those dwelling on hills tilled. The land dictated their labor, their tools suited their tasks, and their tools were crafted from fitting materials. Marshes and wetlands were woven into nets, hillsides were plowed into fields. Thus, the people exchanged what they lacked for what they possessed, and what they were unskilled in for what they excelled at.\n\nHence, few deserted their homes, and many obeyed. Like wind passing through reeds, it stirred them effortlessly, and each responded according to purity or turbidity. All things naturally sought what benefited them and avoided what harmed them.\n\nThus neighboring states, though close enough to hear the sounds of roosters and dogs, never set foot upon one another’s borders, nor did their cart tracks meet beyond a thousand *lǐ*. All simply dwelled in peace.\n\nTherefore, chaotic states appear full, yet are empty; well-ordered states appear sparse, yet are abundant. States on the verge of ruin seem lacking, yet are preserved; thriving states seem excessive, yet endure. The \"empty\" is not without people—each fulfills their role. The \"full\" is not from excess—all are merely awaiting their turn. The \"abundant\" is not from wealth—it is from moderating desires and reducing expenditures. The \"lacking\" is not from scarcity—it is from few people and many costs.\n\nThus the laws of the ancient kings were not their own creation, but what they followed. Their punishments were not their own invention, but what they upheld. This is the Dao of supreme virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world with the Way is not to alter human nature, but to follow what already exists and let it flow freely. Thus, to follow is to become great; to force is to become small.\n\nAncient waterway builders followed the flow of water, farmers followed the suitability of the land, and warriors followed the desires of the people. To follow naturally is to be invincible under Heaven.\n\nAll things have their natural order, and human affairs have their proper governance. Therefore, the ancient kings established laws by aligning with human nature and setting appropriate boundaries. Without their inherent nature, people cannot be made to conform to teachings. Without their resources, they cannot be made to follow the Way.\n\nHuman nature contains the potential for virtue and righteousness, yet without the Sage’s laws and measures, they cannot be directed aright. By guiding them away from what they dislike, punishments are rendered unnecessary, and authority becomes as potent as the divine. To align with their nature is to have the world obey; to defy it is to see laws enacted yet ignored.\n\nVirtue and the Way are the foundation of merit and renown, what the people cherish. When cherished, merit and renown are established.\n\nThe ancient wise rulers modeled themselves after the rivers and seas: the rivers and seas achieve greatness through non-action, broaden themselves through humility, and thus endure. They become the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they receive all rivers; through not seeking, they obtain all; through not striving, they arrive. Thus they take the world without conflict.\n\nBy not self-aggrandizing, they grow rich; by not self-displaying, they grow clear; by not self-exalting, they endure. Dwelling in unremarkable places, they become kings of the world. By not contending, none can contend with them. By never striving to be great, they achieve greatness. The rivers and seas are close to the Way, and thus endure, preserving themselves alongside Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen public rectitude and the Way are cultivated, merit is achieved without possession. Without possession, strength is unshaken. Unshaken yet not tyrannical over others, deep in the Way, deep in virtue, merit and renown are thus fulfilled. This is called profound virtue! Profound! It transcends all things and returns to their origin.",

      "translated_text": "The world has a beginning, yet none know its principle, save the sage who alone understands its source.\nNeither male nor female, neither yin nor yang,\nLife yet never dies—\nHeaven and Earth are formed by it,\nYin and Yang take shape through it,\nAll things arise from it.\n\nThus yin and yang,\nHave roundness and angularity,\nShortness and length,\nPreservation and destruction—\nThe Dao names them all.\nDeep and hidden yet luminous in its workings,\nIn the heart, it is subtle,\nIn the Way, it is fitting.\nLife and death share the same principle,\nAll things change and merge into One Dao.\n\nTo disregard life, to forget death—\nWhere would one not grow old?\nTo abandon action and speech—\nBe cautious of inaction.\n\nTo uphold the Dao with thoroughness,\nOne does not slaughter things.\nIn its utmost subtlety, it is formless—\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth.\nAll things conform to the Dao yet differ in form—\nIn its utmost subtlety, it is without substance,\nAnd thus can encompass all with care.\nIn its utmost greatness, it has no bounds—\nIt shelters all things beneath.\nIn its utmost refinement, it is without interior—\nIt is the treasure of all things.\n\nThe Dao sustains life,\nVirtue shapes existence—\nThe measure of the utmost Dao:\nAbandoning preference and aversion,\nWithout knowing yet without fault,\nAdjusting intentions to harmonize the heart,\nNever opposing the Way.\n\nNow Heaven and Earth,\nConcentrated, become One,\nDivided, become Two,\nInteracting, they unite—\nAbove and below, they never fail.\nConcentrated, they become One,\nDivided, they become Five,\nYet when they return, they must align with the square and the compass.\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be slighted,\nMost near yet cannot be distanced—\nSeeking it in the near, one goes and returns.\n\nLaozi said:\n*The Emperor* has a name, yet none know his nature;\n*The Emperor* values virtue,\nThe king prizes righteousness,\nThe hegemon is constrained by principle.\n\nThe sage’s Way is without partiality—\nThe Way is first, then wisdom is employed,\nVirtue is thin, then form is applied,\nInsight is shallow, then discernment is used.\nThose who rely on wisdom have troubled hearts,\nThose who rely on punishment have resentment above and below,\nThose who rely on discernment seek favor from the superior to serve their own ends—\nThus they bring ruin.\n\nTherefore the sage follows the transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd his virtue is like Heaven’s canopy and Earth’s foundation.\nThe Way is practiced in due measure,\nAnd his nourishment is profound.\nProfound nourishment brings order—\nEven gods and saints cannot easily surpass it.\n\nAbandoning the heart’s schemes,\nPunishments are reduced—\nReturning to purity and stillness,\nThings will naturally align.\n\nThe Dao as ruler is like a corpse—\nSolemn and silent,\nYet the world receives its blessings.\nOne person benefits from it without partiality,\nTen thousand benefit without favoritism.\n\nThus heavy kindness is as harmful as heavy cruelty—\nBoth deviate from the Way.\nHeavy kindness spreads gifts,\nBestowing rewards without merit,\nGranting honors without labor—\nThen those who hold office slack in their duties,\nWhile idlers rush forward in ambition.\n\nHeavy cruelty is arbitrary execution,\nDeath without fault,\nPunishment of the righteous—\nThen those who cultivate their conduct do not encourage goodness,\nWhile the wicked dare to defy their superiors.\n\nThus heavy kindness breeds deceit,\nHeavy cruelty breeds chaos—\nDeceit and chaos are the winds of fallen states.\n\nTherefore when punishments are meted out, the ruler feels no anger,\nWhen rewards are given, the sovereign does not share—\nThe punished do not blame the ruler,\nFor the punishment is just.\nThe rewarded do not credit the sovereign,\nFor the reward is earned.\nThe people know that punishments and rewards arise from their own deeds,\nThus they strive in their duties and cultivate their arts—\nNo gifts are received from others.\nHence the court is uncluttered yet without neglect,\nThe fields are open yet without filth—\nThus the *Taishang* knows yet does not possess.\n\nThe kingly Way is to dwell in the affairs of non-action,\nTo practice the teaching of non-speech,\nTo be pure and still, unmoved—\nTo measure once and never sway.\nTo follow naturally, to let things unfold,\nTo complete without labor,\nTo plan without losing strategy,\nTo act without error,\nTo speak without ornaments,\nTo move without display,\nTo advance and retreat in accord with the times,\nTo act and rest in harmony with principle—\nNeither loving nor hating beauty and ugliness,\nNeither rejoicing nor angering in rewards and punishments.\n\nNames are self-bestowed,\nKinds are self-classified,\nAffairs arise from nature—\nNone originate from oneself.\nIf one attempts to constrain them,\nOne only drives them further away.\nIf one attempts to embellish them,\nOne only robs them of their truth.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* is the spirit,\nEarth’s *qi* is the ether—\nReversed, they are profound and mysterious,\nEach dwelling in its proper place,\nGuarding them without loss,\nAscending to the *Taiyi* (Supreme Unity),\nThe essence of the *Taiyi* merging with Heaven.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is silent and silent again—\nWithout measure, without rule,\nGreat beyond extremity,\nDeep beyond measure,\nEver transforming with humanity,\nWisdom cannot grasp it—\nIts revolutions are endless,\nIts transformations divine,\nIts emptiness follows without leading.\nWhen it governs and orders,\nIt is a heart of voidness, a spirit of weakness—\nYet clear and undimmed.\nThus all ministers gather like spokes to the hub,\nNone, whether wise or foolish, virtuous or base,\nFail to give their utmost—\nThe sovereign gains the means to govern his ministers,\nThe ministers gain the means to serve their sovereign,\nAnd thus the Way of governing the state is made clear.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"Those who know and love to ask are sages,\nThose who are courageous and love to ask are conquerors.*\n*He who rides upon the wisdom of the multitude can accomplish anything,\nHe who uses the strength of the multitude can overcome anything.*\n*He who uses the strength of the multitude need not rely on Wu Ge,\nHe who rides upon the power of the multitude need not rely on the world’s might.*\n*Without authority, one cannot wield power,\nYet failing to follow the natural order of things,\nEven sages cannot achieve renown.\"*\n\nTherefore the sage, when acting,\nNever fails to use their resources as they should—\nOne with a form occupies a place,\nOne with ability serves a task.\nIf their strength exceeds their role,\nThe burden of the one who raises them is not heavy.\nIf their ability exceeds their task,\nThe one who employs them finds no difficulty.\n\nThe sage combines and utilizes all—\nThus no person is cast aside, no talent neglected.\n\nLaozi said:\n*\"So-called non-action is not to say that things are not drawn near when invited,\nNor pushed away when repelled,\nNor that they do not respond when pressed,\nNor that they are unmoved when stirred—\nNor that they are rigid and stagnant, yet do not flow,\nNor that they are coiled and grasped, yet do not disperse.*\n*It means that private desires do not intrude upon public Dao,\nThat cravings do not cling to proper methods—*\n*To act in accordance with principle,\nTo establish merit through one’s resources,\nTo follow the natural momentum of things,*\n*Yet if one forces them, they cannot be contained—*\n*To achieve success yet never claim it for oneself,*\n*To set up merit yet never possess its name.*\n*As water carries boats,\nAs ice aids the skater,\nAs mud supports the plow,\nAs mountains anchor the cart—*\n*Summer’s floods, winter’s shallows,*\n*High becomes mountain, low becomes pool,*\n*None of this is my doing.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Laozi says: To govern oneself, the highest priority is to nourish the spirit (*shén*), the next to nourish the form (*xíng*). When the spirit is clear and the mind is tranquil, all hundred joints are at ease—this is the foundation of life-nourishment. Plump flesh and full belly, indulging in appetites—these are the superficial aspects of life-nourishment.\n\nTo govern a state, the highest priority is to nourish the natural order (*huà*), the next to uphold the laws. When people vie in yielding and humility, compete in receiving little of wealth and profit, and vie in embracing laborious tasks, day by day the natural order ascends and virtue improves—this, without knowing how, is the foundation of governance. When rewards and benefits encourage virtue, and fear of punishment prevents wrongdoing, laws and commands are established above while the people submit below—this is the superficial aspect of governance. In the ancient age, the foundation was cultivated, while in the later age, the superficial was attended to.\n\nLaozi says: A ruler capable of governance does not appear in every age, nor does a minister capable of governance appear in every thousand. Seeking the latter with the former, this is why even the most refined governance is not found once in a thousand years.\n\nThe achievements of hegemons (*bàwáng*) are not established in every age. If one aligns with the people’s benevolent intentions and guards against their deceitful hearts, sharing the same Dao with them, then the people can be virtuous and customs refined.\n\nWhat is precious about the Sage is not their imposition of punishments for crimes, but their understanding of where disorder arises. If one sharpens their malicious inclinations and lets them run wild in licentiousness and depravity, then abandons them to the law and follows them with punishment, even if one slaughters and plunders the world, they cannot suppress its deceit.\n\nLaozi says: If one’s body rests above the rivers and seas, yet their heart lies beneath the palace gates, then they hold life dear, and cherishing life means they will not covet profit. If they cannot conquer themselves yet force others to submit, this is called harming oneself. Those who harm themselves will have no longevity.\n\nHence it is said: Knowing harmony is knowing constancy, knowing constancy is knowing wisdom, increasing life is auspiciousness, and directing the mind to move *qi* is strength—this is called the Mysterious Unity. Use its light, and return to its wisdom.\n\nLaozi says: Nothing is easier than doing good, nothing is harder than not doing good. What is called doing good is to remain still and take no action, to follow one’s nature and abandon excess, to avoid all temptations and inducements, to follow one’s nature and preserve truth, to have no change within oneself. Hence, it is said that doing good is easy.\n\nWhat is called not doing good is hard: usurpation and regicide, deceit and hypocrisy, impetuosity and excessive desires—these are not in accord with human nature. Hence, it is said that not doing good is hard.\n\nNow, what is considered the greatest calamity arises from the absence of constancy, satiety, and moderation. Therefore, in matters of profit and harm, and at the juncture of misfortune and fortune, one must be vigilant.\n\nThe Sage has no desires, no evasions. If one pursues something, they may lose it; if one avoids something, they may gain it. If one’s resolve has something it desires, they will forget their purpose. This is why the Sage carefully discerns the changes between action and stillness, and adjusts their reception and giving accordingly. They harmonize the emotions of love and hate, and balance the rhythms of joy and anger.\n\nIf action and stillness are well-managed, calamity will not invade. If reception and giving are appropriate, guilt will not accumulate. If love and hate are properly balanced, sorrow will not approach. If joy and anger are harmonized, resentment will not arise.\n\nThose who embody the Dao do not seek gains lightly nor shirk misfortune. If they do not abandon, it is not because they cannot restrain themselves, but because they are always full yet never overflowing, always empty yet easily replenished.\n\nHence, if one governs themselves with Daoist principles and moderation, then food will suffice to fill their emptiness, clothing to ward off cold, and this will be enough to ensure warmth and sustenance for their seven-foot form. Without Daoist principles and moderation, even if they demand the trappings of honor and nobility, the power of ten thousand chariots will not bring them satisfaction, nor will the wealth of the world bring them joy. Thus, the Sage remains tranquil in heart and easy in resolve, guarding their spirit within, and external things cannot disturb them.\n\nLaozi says: Those who overcome others have strength, those who overcome themselves are strong. To be strong, one must necessarily employ others’ strength, and to employ others’ strength, one must necessarily win others’ hearts. To win others’ hearts, one must necessarily attain self-mastery. There has never been one who attained themselves yet lost others, nor one who lost themselves yet gained others.\n\nHence, the foundation of governance lies in calming the people, the foundation of calming the people lies in ensuring their sufficiency, the foundation of sufficiency lies in not encroaching upon their natural rhythms, the foundation of not encroaching lies in reducing their burdens, the foundation of reducing burdens lies in moderating their desires, the foundation of moderation lies in removing arrogance, and the foundation of removing arrogance lies in emptiness and non-being. Thus, those who know the nature of life do not labor for what they cannot attain, and those who know the nature of fate do not worry over what they cannot control.\n\nThe eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth craves flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds—when the seven orifices vie in contention, they harm the singular nature (*yīxìng*). Day by day, they draw out licentious desires and exhaust their natural harmony (*tiān hé*). Even their own bodies cannot be governed, let alone the world. Those who claim to have gained the world are not those who occupy power and titles, assume noble names, or speak of ruling the world’s heart and strength. With the name of kingship yet no one’s praise, this is to have lost the world.\n\nHence, Jie and Zhou were not true kings, nor were Tang and Wu mere bandits. When the world gains the Dao, it rests in guarding the four frontier regions (*sìyí*), when the world loses the Dao, it rests in the hands of the feudal lords. When feudal lords gain the Dao, they rest in guarding their borders, when they lose the Dao, they rest in their own retainers. Hence it is said: Do not rely on others taking from you, but rely on your inability to be taken from. Practicing the Dao that can be seized, yet not engaging in usurpation and regicide, is of no benefit in maintaining the world.\n\nLaozi says: The skilled ruler of a state does not alter their established ways nor change their constants. Anger is contrary to virtue, arms are instruments of violence, and contention is the source of disorder. Plotting in secret is contrary to virtue, delighting in violence is the use of instruments of violence, and managing disorder is the height of contradiction.\n\nIt is not possible to create calamity without harming others. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their chaos, soften their brilliance, and equalize their dust. All people’s emotions and inclinations wish to be virtuous themselves yet resent others not reaching them. Wishing to be virtuous themselves gives rise to contentious hearts, resenting others not reaching them gives rise to grievances and contention. When grievances and contention arise, the heart is disordered and *qi* is rebellious. Hence, the ancient Sages retreated from contention and grievance. When contention and grievance do not arise, the heart is governed and *qi* is harmonious. Hence it is said: Do not exalt the virtuous, so that the people do not contend.",

      "translated_text": "The Master Laozi says: Those who govern things do not rely on things to achieve harmony; those who govern harmony do not rely on harmony to govern people; those who govern people do not rely on people to govern the ruler; those who govern the ruler do not rely on the ruler to govern desires; those who govern desires do not rely on desires to govern nature; those who govern nature do not rely on nature to govern virtue; those who govern virtue do not rely on virtue to govern the Dao/Way.\n\nTo govern with the Dao/Way as the foundation of people’s nature, there is no perversion or impurity. If one lingers long among things, they forget their foundation, and thus align with the nature of things.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs are not the nature of people; they are imposed from without. Thus, when people’s nature is balanced, excessive desires harm them. Only those who follow the Dao/Way can abandon things and return to their true selves.\n\nIf one can self-reflect, they will not lose the essence of things; if they cannot, their actions will only breed confusion and deceit.\n\nTo indulge desires is to lose one’s nature; when actions are unrestrained, they are never correct. To govern life with such unrestrained actions is to lose one’s body; to govern the state is to incite chaos among the people. Hence, those who do not hear the Dao/Way cannot return to their true nature.\n\nThe ancient Sages understood all from within themselves, so their commands were carried out and forbidden acts ceased. When undertaking any matter, one must first calm their intentions and clarify their mind. When the mind is clear and intentions are calm, then the affairs of things can be set right.\n\nTo hear only praise or blame, to gaze lustfully upon colors and hues, makes it difficult to achieve order in governance. Hence, the value of emptiness.\n\nThus, water stirred will raise waves, and rebellious *qi* will cloud the mind. A clouded mind cannot govern correctly, and waves cannot settle into stillness. Therefore, the ancient Sages held to the One, to regulate the emotions and inclinations of things.\n\nThe One is the most precious, without limit in the world. The ancient Sages entrusted themselves to the limitless, thus they could command all under Heaven.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Yin and Yang refine all things, all riding upon the One *qi* to emerge. When the ruler and subjects are divided in heart, *qi* ascends and stagnates. When the ruler and ministers are not in harmony, the five grains do not flourish. When spring is stern and autumn withers, when winter thunders and summer frosts, these are all born of the disruption of *qi*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is but one body; within the six directions, there is but one form. Thus, those who understand nature cannot be coerced by Heaven and Earth, and those who discern omens cannot be deceived by strange creatures.\n\nThe Sages know the near to understand the far, considering ten thousand *li* as one measure. When *qi* rises to Heaven and Earth, rites, justice, and propriety are not established, and the people all violate one another, committing cruelty and violence. This arises from their being lost in the murky chaos.\n\nWhen justice and shame are neglected, and the age declines, harm increases while wealth diminishes. Labor is excessive while sustenance is insufficient. The people grow poor and wretched, and resentment and contention arise. Hence, the value of *ren*.\n\nWhen people are coarse and unequal, forming cliques and factions, each promoting their own, harboring cunning and deceitful hearts, hence the value of *yi*.\n\nWhen men and women dwell together without distinction, hence the value of rites.\n\nWhen the emotions of life are unrestrained and press upon one another in desperation, they become discordant. Hence, the value of music.\n\nThus, *ren*, *yi*, rites, and music are means to remedy failures, not universal paths to governance.\n\nIf one can truly settle the mind and return to its original state, then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang will follow and encompass them, ensuring wealth and nourishment for all. The hearts of greed, coarseness, resentment, and contention will not arise.\n\n*Ren* and *yi* do not harm, while virtue and the Dao/Way are established, and the world is governed. The people will not indulge in colors and hues. Thus, when virtue decays, *ren* and *yi* are adorned; when harmony is lost, music is adjusted; when rites are violated, appearance is refined.\n\nHence, knowing the Dao/Way and virtue, one then knows that *ren* and *yi* are insufficient for action; knowing *ren* and *yi*, one then knows that rites and music are insufficient for cultivation.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Governance through purity and stillness is to be in harmony and order, yet tranquil and unassuming. It is simple and true, yet undyed and unadorned. It is calm and quiet, yet not restless. Within, it aligns with the Dao/Way; without, it conforms with *yi*. Its words are concise yet follow principle; its actions are pleasing yet accord with human nature. Its heart is harmonious yet unfeigned; its affairs are plain yet undecorated. It does not contrive beginnings nor debate endings. It remains settled when at ease, and moves when stirred. Its body resonates with Heaven and Earth, its essence with Yin and Yang. It harmonizes with the four seasons, its radiance with the sun and moon. It acts in accordance with the Dao/Way’s transformations, and cunning, mechanical deceit and pretense have no place in its heart.\n\nThus, Heaven covers with virtue, Earth bears with music. The four seasons do not lose their order, winds and rains do not act capriciously. The sun and moon are pure and still, shining forth their light. The five stars do not lose their courses—this is the clarity of purity and stillness.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: In a well-governed age, the duties of governance are easily upheld, its affairs are easily managed, its rites are easily followed, its rewards are easily bestowed.\n\nThus, one person does not hold multiple offices, and an official does not hold the rank of a scholar. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants dwell in separate districts and states, so farmers speak of farming to farmers, scholars speak of conduct to scholars, artisans speak of skill to artisans, and merchants speak of numbers to merchants.\n\nThus, scholars have no neglected conduct, artisans no laborious tasks, farmers no wasted effort, and merchants no losses in trade—each finds contentment in their nature.\n\nThough forms and types differ, their affairs are simple yet not contradictory. When placed in lowly positions, they are despised; when in power, they are honored.\n\nThose who possess foresight and far-reaching vision are the most talented, yet in a well-governed age, they are not burdened with responsibilities. Those who are widely learned and resolute in will, quick-tongued and eloquent, are the most knowledgeable, yet enlightened rulers do not seek such qualities from their subjects. Those who scorn the world and hold others in contempt, who do not conform to common customs, are the most virtuous in conduct, yet in a well-governed age, they are not used to transform the people.\n\nHence, those whose height is unattainable are not set as measures for others; those whose conduct cannot be emulated are not made the customs of the state. Thus, individual talents cannot be monopolized, while measures, virtue, and Dao/Way can be passed down through the ages.\n\nTherefore, when a state is well-governed, even the foolish can uphold it; and its military can be organized by law alone. It does not depend on ancient heroes, but the people are naturally sufficient—using what they possess and combining their strengths.\n\nThe laws of the declining age set high standards yet punishments do not reach those who fail; impose heavy burdens yet penalties cannot overcome the offense; establish perilous dangers yet executions are not dared. The people are burdened by these three demands, and thus feign cleverness to deceive their superiors, act wickedly, and court danger. Even with harsh laws and severe punishments, they cannot be deterred from their deceit.",

      "translated_text": "「The Master Laozi says: The **Dao/Way** of the **君子** is to remain **静** in order to cultivate the self, and to practice **俭** to nourish life. **静** means the lower does not disturb; the lower not disturbed means the people do not grumble. When the lower disturbs, governance is chaotic; when the people grumble, **virtue/power** is thin. In chaos, the wise do not plot for him; with thin **virtue/power**, the brave do not fight for him.\n\nBut the disordered ruler is otherwise: in one day he may possess the wealth of the world, wield the power of a sovereign, exhaust the people’s strength, and indulge the desires of his ears and eyes. His mind is fixed on palaces, pavilions, moats, and gardens filled with rare beasts and strange treasures. The common folk suffer hunger and cold, while his halls are adorned with embroidered silks. Thus, though the ruler hoards these useless things, the world does not find peace in his reign.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: Without **惔漠** (indifference), one cannot clarify **德** (**virtue/power**). Without **宁静** (tranquility), one cannot attain the distant. Without **宽大** (magnanimity), one cannot unite and cover all. Without **正平** (justice and fairness), one cannot make judgments. To see with the eyes of the world, to hear with the ears of the world, to deliberate with the hearts of the world, and to contend with the strength of the world—thus his commands can reach the depths, and the emotions of his subjects can ascend to his ears. All officials follow their duties in order, and ministers gather like spokes to the hub.\n\nHe does not reward for joy, nor punish for anger. His laws and decrees are clear yet not harsh; his senses are open yet not obscured. The merits and faults of his subjects are laid before him daily, yet he does not resist them. Thus the wise exhaust their intelligence, the unworthy exert their strength, those near secure their livelihood, and those far away cherish his **德** (**virtue/power**). This is the **Dao/Way** of employing people.\n\nHe who rides in the royal carriage does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*. He who sails in a boat does not swim yet crosses rivers and seas. If a man’s words are true, even though he be a common laborer or herdsman, he must not be discarded. If a man’s words are false, even though he be a king or prime minister, he must not be used. The judgment of truth and falsehood cannot be decided by rank or status.\n\nThe wise do not shame those whose counsel is useful, nor do they prize those whose words are merely eloquent. The foolish ruler is otherwise: those ministers who sincerely offer their loyalty, he seldom employs, while he favors those who are familiar with deceit and perversion. The wise he cannot see, nor does he hear the words of those who are distant and lowly, though they exert their strength in loyalty.\n\nHe who speaks is challenged with words, he who remonstrates is punished with crimes. Yet such a ruler wishes to bring peace to the seas within his borders and preserve all under heaven—how far he is from wisdom!\n\nThe Master Laozi says: He who can **尊生** (honor life) will not harm his body with wealth and honor, nor burden his form with poverty and meanness. Now, having inherited the noble rank of our ancestors, one must surely cherish the source of life’s origin, yet neglects its loss—is this not perplexing?\n\nTo govern the world with **身** (the self), one may entrust it to the world. To love the world with **身** (the self), one may thereby be entrusted with the world.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: What is the foundation of ruling a state?\n\nThe Master Laozi replied: The foundation lies in governing oneself. Never have I heard of one who governs himself yet brings disorder to his state, nor of one who brings disorder to himself yet governs his state well.\n\nThus it is said: Cultivate it in the self, and its **德** (**virtue/power**) will be true.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is so supremely wondrous that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Hence, the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: How does one act so that the people love their ruler?\n\nThe Master Laozi replied: One must govern them with due **时** (timing) and treat them with **敬慎** (reverence and caution), as though standing at the edge of a deep abyss or walking on thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good I nurture, the wicked I destroy. In ancient times, the ministers of **夏** and **商**, turning against the tyrants **桀** and **纣**, served **Tāng** and **Wǔ**. The people of **Hòushā** (Hostile Sands), attacking their own ruler, returned to the **Shénnóng** (Divine Farmer). Hence it is said: *“What the people fear, one must not fail to fear.”*\n\nThe Master Laozi says: In governing the great, the **Dao/Way** cannot be small. In lands vast, the rule cannot be narrow. In high stations, affairs cannot be burdensome. In states with many people, instruction cannot be harsh.\n\nBurdensome affairs are hard to govern, harsh laws are hard to enforce, excessive demands are hard to satisfy. Measure by the inch, and even a *zhàng* (ten feet) will be wrong; weigh by the *zhū* (small weight), and even a *dàn* (one hundred *catty*) will be off. Yet if one uses a *zhàng* to measure a *zhàng* and a *dàn* to weigh a *dàn*, few errors will occur. Great comparisons are easily made with wisdom, while intricate arguments are hard to resolve with true insight.\n\nThus, what harms governance yet aids disorder, the sage does not practice; what does not aid utility yet increases expenditure, the wise do not follow.\n\nHence, efforts are not weary of being frugal, affairs are not weary of being simplified, demands are not weary of being few. Frugal efforts are easy to accomplish, simplified affairs are easy to govern, few demands are easy to satisfy, and when entrusted to the common people, it is easy.\n\nThus, petty eloquence harms **义** (righteousness), petty righteousness undermines the **Dao/Way**. If the **Dao/Way** is petty, it will not prevail; if it prevails, it must be simple.\n\nThe river flows far because it winds gently, the mountain stands high because it rises gradually. The **Dao/Way** transforms because it moves effortlessly.\n\nHe who is skilled in one art, precise in one matter, or discerning in one talent may be able to argue cleverly, but cannot apply broadly.\n\nHe who tunes music knows that small strings must be tight and large ones slack. He who establishes affairs knows that the lowly must labor while the noble must rest.\n\nThe words of the **Dao/Way** say: *“Vague and obscure, aligning with heaven’s **威** (awe), harmonizing with heaven’s **气** (qi).”* One who harmonizes with **气** (qi) becomes **帝** (Emperor), one who harmonizes with **义** (righteousness) becomes **王** (King), one who harmonizes with **功** (achievement) becomes **霸** (Hegemon). One who lacks all three perishes.\n\nThus, he does not speak yet is believed, does not act yet is kind, does not rage yet commands **威** (awe). Hence, his transformations move with the **天心** (heavenly intent).\n\nIf he acts yet is not kind, if he speaks yet is not trusted, if he rages yet does not command **威** (awe), then he is merely performing the outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the **Dao/Way** to guide, even few laws are sufficient for governance. Without the **Dao/Way**, even many laws are sufficient for disorder.\n\nThe Master Laozi says: A whale removed from water is dominated by ants. A ruler who abandons his proper course and contends with his ministers is dominated by his officials. To hold one’s station with **无为** (**wuwei**—non-action), those who guard their duties take pleasure in compliance. The ministers conceal their wisdom and do not use it, instead devoting themselves to the ruler’s affairs.»",

      "translated_text": "The sovereign who does not rely on able ministers but delights in self-action will find his wisdom daily constrained while bearing sole responsibility. When his schemes are thwarted by inferiors, he cannot rectify matters; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain authority. If his wisdom is insufficient for governance and his **威** (awe) is insufficient to enforce punishment, then he cannot properly engage with his subjects.\n\nWhen joy and anger manifest in his heart and desires are evident in his actions, those who guard their duties abandon principle to curry favor, officials distort the law to follow the wind, rewards do not match merit, and punishments do not fit crimes. Thus, the ruler and subjects diverge in intent, and the sovereign and ministers harbor mutual resentment. Officials grow weary of confusion while the ruler’s wisdom cannot resolve it; slander arises while his discernment cannot illuminate it. When he blames himself for faults not his own, the sovereign’s labor increases while his ministers grow ever more negligent. Hence, even the skilled artisan who hews without measure rarely avoids injuring his hands.\n\nTo race horses with a runner, one’s sinews will snap before catching up; to mount a chariot and seize the reins after the horse has died beneath the yoke, even **伯乐** (Bo Le, the master horse judge) and **王良** (Wang Liang, the master charioteer) cannot revive it. Yet a wise ruler seeks such talents without the labor of judging or driving, thus harnessing others’ excellence.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the sovereign is to act without action yet achieve results, to establish without attachment. If one takes a stance, criticism follows; if one takes pleasure, flattery follows. Criticism invites usurpation; flattery invites deception. Those who erect a foundation only to be constrained by others cannot sustain the state. Thus, the skilled founder does not uproot—his structure is formless. Only the **神化** (transcendent transformation) cannot be overcome by anything.\n\nWhen inner desires do not manifest, it is called **道** (the **Dao/Way**); when external deceit does not penetrate, it is called **闭** (closure). When inner and outer are closed, what matter cannot be regulated? When the outer is closed to the inner, what matter cannot be accomplished?\n\nThus, he does not act yet achieves, does not force yet succeeds. His words are not boastful, his deeds are not usurping. He follows names to demand reality, assigning duties to their proper officers. To take **无知** (non-knowing) as the **Dao/Way**, to make **禁苛** (restraining excess) the principle—then all official matters will have their proper measure.\n\nLaozi says: Food is the foundation of people, and the people are the foundation of the state. Therefore, the sovereign must align with the **天时** (heavenly timing) above, exhaust the **地理** (earthly resources) below, and utilize human effort within. Thus, all living things flourish, and the ten thousand things proliferate. In spring, he cuts the withered; in summer, he harvests the fruits; in autumn, he stores vegetables and grains; in winter, he gathers firewood. These are provided for the people, ensuring no scarcity in life and no unburied dead.\n\nThe laws of the ancient kings did not net schools of fish to take the **镺●** (a type of fish), nor did they individually fish in marshes. They did not set fires to hunt in the forests, nor did they allow snares to traverse the wilds before the **豺** (wild dogs) had been sacrificed. They did not cast nets in water before the **獭** (otters) had been sacrificed, nor did they spread traps before the **鹰隼** (hawks and falcons) had struck. They did not fell trees before the foliage had fallen, nor did they burn fields before insects had burrowed. They did not pasture pregnant animals, nor did they take **鷇卵** (eggs of certain birds), nor did they take fish shorter than a **尺** (chi, ~23 cm). They did not slaughter pigs and dogs before they had reached maturity. Thus, all things grew as if steaming from the earth. This was how the ancient kings adapted to the times, ensuring prosperity for the state and benefit for the people. It was not something seen with the eyes and done with the feet—those who sought to benefit the people did not forget it in their hearts, and thus the people prepared themselves.\n\nLaozi says: In ancient times, enlightened rulers moderated their demands on the people and regulated their own sustenance. They calculated the harvests by the year, measured the people’s stored provisions, and knew the surplus and deficit before taking what was due. Thus, they received what heaven and earth bestowed and avoided the perils of hunger and cold.\n\nWhen they shared the people’s hardships—when the state faced famine, their food was unrefined; when the people suffered cold, they did not wear fur in winter—they shared in the people’s joys and sorrows, and thus there were no pitiful subjects under heaven.\n\nBut a tyrannical ruler does otherwise: he exacts labor beyond the people’s strength, demands tribute without regard to their stores. Men and women cannot engage in farming and weaving to supply his demands. Their labor is exhausted, their wealth depleted, with no dawn without toil and no evening of rest. The sovereign and ministers grow to resent each other.\n\nMoreover, in sustaining life, if one person plows and tends the land, the yield from the middle field does not exceed four **石** (dou, ~60 kg). With wives, children, and the elderly depending on it, and occasional calamities, to supply the sovereign’s demands would move even the most compassionate ruler to pity.\n\nGreedy tyrants drain their people like drying up fishponds to satisfy their insatiable desires, and thus the people no longer benefit from the **天和** (heaven’s harmony) or **地德** (earth’s virtue).\n\nLaozi says: The **qi** of heaven and earth finds no greater harmony than **和** (harmony). Harmony is the balance of **阴** (yin) and **阳** (yang), the division of day and night. Thus, all things sprout at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Growth and completion both depend on the essence of harmony.\n\nExcessive **阴** does not generate; excessive **阳** does not transform. Only when **阴** and **阳** interact does harmony emerge. Thus, the **Dao/Way** of the sage is broad yet cautious, stern yet warm, gentle yet upright, fierce yet virtuous.\n\nExcessive rigidity breaks; excessive softness curls. The **Dao/Way** lies in the balance between rigidity and softness.\n\nThe **绳** (plumb line) as a measure can be rolled and carried, stretched and laid straight. It is neither too long nor too short, neither rigid nor slack—thus the sage embodies it.\n\nIf kindness is overused, it becomes weakness; weakness begets no **威** (awe). If sternness is overused, it becomes brutality; brutality breeds no harmony. If love is overused, it becomes indulgence; indulgence begets no order. If punishment is overused, it becomes calamity; calamity breeds no loyalty. Hence, harmony is most valued.\n\nLaozi says: The reason a state endures is that it follows the **Dao/Way**; the reason it perishes is that its governance is blocked. Thus, the sage observes transformations to discern their omens.\n\n**德** (virtue/power) waxes and wanes, and the winds reveal the first signs.

      "translated_text": "The ruler of a chaotic state seeks vast territory but neglects benevolence and righteousness, pursues high rank but neglects virtue and morality. Thus, they abandon what sustains them and create what brings their ruin.\n\nIf the ruler obscures the luminaries of heaven above and loses the hearts of the people below, who cannot fail to topple? Therefore, those who examine themselves carefully do not rely on others.\n\nThe ancients who practiced the **Dao/Way** called deep practice *virtue/power and morality*, shallow practice *benevolence and righteousness*, and superficial practice *rites and wisdom*. These six aspects are the sinews of the state.\n\nDeep practice brings abundant blessings, shallow practice brings meager blessings, and full practice earns universal submission. In antiquity, cultivating virtue/power and morality rectified the world, cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a kingdom, and cultivating rites and wisdom rectified a village. Those with profound virtue/power became great, those with shallow virtue/power remained small.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** does not rely on brute strength to establish itself, nor on rigidity to triumph, nor on greed to gain. It stands when the world follows it, prevails when the world submits to it, and obtains when it gives to the world—not by seizing. Therefore, yielding establishes it, softness overcomes it, benevolence and righteousness secure it, and non-contention means none can contend with it. Hence, the **Dao/Way** in the world is like the great rivers and seas.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven: those who act against it perish, those who cling to it lose it. If one seeks great fame and strives for it, I see that they cannot help but lose it—even if they grasp it, they cannot retain it. Fame cannot be sought and obtained; it is given by the world. Those to whom the world gives, the world returns to them. What the world returns is *virtue/power*, hence it is said:\n\n*\"The virtuous/powerful of high virtue/power are followed by the world,\nThe benevolent of high benevolence are followed by all within the seas,\nThe righteous of high righteousness are followed by a single kingdom,\nThe ritualists of high rites are followed by a single village.\nWithout these four, the people will not follow.\nIf they do not follow, resorting to arms is perilous.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Warfare is the instrument of last resort, to be used only when unavoidable.\nTo kill and injure people, yet nourish them without delight—\nHence it is said:\n'Where death reigns, thorns and brambles grow,\nThere one weeps with sorrow and dwells with funeral rites.'\nTherefore, the virtuous/powerful cultivate virtue/power and morality,\nAnd do not frequently resort to arms.\"*\n\n**Wénzǐ** asked: *\"Why are benevolence, righteousness, and rites considered shallow compared to virtue/power and morality?\"*\n\nLaozi replied: *\"Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy,\nThose who practice righteousness must clarify taking and giving.\nWithin the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot reach all,\nAnd exhausting the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice to provide for the people.\nThus, it is known that cultivating the **Dao/Way** and practicing virtue/power—\nFollowing the nature of Heaven and Earth—\nAll things will naturally align, and the world will be amply nourished.\nBenevolence and righteousness arise from this.\nHence, the noble man dwells in what is profound,\nNot in what is shallow.\"*\n\nRites are the adornment of substance, benevolence is the manifestation of kindness. Thus, rites follow human sentiment without exceeding it, benevolence does not overflow kindness. Sorrow and grief arise from genuine emotion, and honoring the dead aligns with benevolence.\n\nNurturing life does not force what people cannot achieve, nor does it cut off what they cannot abandon. Moderation in measure ensures nothing is lost, and without false praise, no discord arises. Thus, music is composed to harmonize joy, and happiness does not stray from accord. Clarity in the distinction between life and death, and understanding the balance of extravagance and frugality—these are the ways.\n\nBut in the latter ages, words and deeds contradict, emotions and appearances oppose each other. Rites become burdensome with excess, music becomes chaotic with indulgence. Customs sink into decadence, and false praise flourishes at court. Thus, the sage is abandoned and unused.\n\nChasing a swift horse on foot, a man cannot outpace it, but placing it in a chariot, the horse cannot outpace him. Therefore, those skilled in the **Dao/Way** use others’ strengths to achieve their ends, leveraging what they can against what others cannot.\n\nWhen the ruler acts in season, the people respond with wealth.\nWhen the ruler treats them with rites, the people respond with loyalty.\nWhen the ruler meets them with justice, the people respond with death.\nThus, there are perilous states without secure rulers,\nAnd there are anxious rulers without contented ministers.\n\nVirtue/power exceeding one’s station brings honor,\nWealth exceeding one’s virtue/power brings calamity.\nVirtue/power is valued without limit,\nRighteousness is taken without excess.\nOne does not usurp position through virtue/power,\nNor steal wealth through righteousness.\n\nThe sage finds contentment in poverty and joy in the **Dao/Way**,\nDoes not harm life through desire,\nNor burden oneself with gain.\nThus, they do not violate righteousness to seek security.\n\nIn antiquity, without virtue/power, none were honored,\nWithout ability, none held office,\nWithout merit, none received rewards,\nWithout guilt, none were punished.\nTheir advancement of people was through rites,\nTheir removal of people was through righteousness.\nIn the age of the petty, advancement is like ascending to heaven,\nAnd removal is like descending into the abyss.\nThis speaks to the contrast between antiquity and the present.\n\nSelecting horses, the flaw is seen in their leanness;\nChoosing scholars, the flaw is seen in their poverty.\nFat pigs fill the kitchen,\nWhile emaciated bones hold no office.\n\nThe virtuous/powerful discern truth and do not heed slander.\nTo admonish a ruler who does not listen is not loyalty,\nTo admonish and not be heard is the ruler’s lack of clarity.\nIf the people sink in corruption and the minister does not grieve, this is not wise counsel.\nThus, to guard one’s principles and die in difficulty is the duty of a minister,\nAnd to endure cold and hunger is the kindness of a father.\n\nTo use great matters for small is called *perverting people*,\nTo use small matters against great is called *defying Heaven*.\nThough one may sacrifice to Heaven beforehand,\nThey will surely fall into ruin afterward.\nThus, in villages, the elderly are respected by seniority,\nAnd in the court, rank determines precedence.\n\nThe exalted are honored because they are near the ruler,\nThe elderly are revered because they are near kin,\nThe aged are respected because they are near brothers.\nThose born noble become arrogant,\nThose born rich become extravagant.\nThus, without reflecting on the **Dao/Way** through noble status and wealth,\nFew can avoid wrongdoing.\n\nTo study without satiety is to govern oneself,\nTo teach without weariness is to govern the people.\nWith worthy teachers and good friends,\nFew will abandon virtue and do wrong.\n\nTo know the worthy is wisdom,\nTo love the worthy is benevolence,\nTo honor the worthy is righteousness,\nTo respect the worthy is rites,\nTo delight in the worthy is music.",

      "translated_text": "「Laozi says: For all who study the **Dao/Way**, if they can clarify the distinction between Heaven and humanity, grasp the essence of governance and disorder, and purify their heart and mind to preserve it, then seeing its beginning and end and returning to its emptiness and nothingness, this may be called attaining.\n\nThe root of governance is **virtue/power (仁義)**, and its branches are laws and institutions (**法度**). What gives rise to humanity is the root, and what does not is the branch. Root and branch are one body, yet they have two loves: this is human nature. To prioritize the root over the branch is called a **gentleman/junzi (君子)**, to prioritize the branch over the root is called a **petty person/xiao ren (小人)**. When laws arise, they are to assist **virtue/power (仁義)**; if one values laws over **virtue/power**, it is like cherishing one’s cap and shoes while neglecting one’s head and feet. To value **virtue/power (仁義)** is to broaden and exalt it; if one does not increase its depth while only expanding its breadth, it will be ruined. If one does not widen its foundation while only increasing its height, it will collapse. Therefore, one should not magnify the beams of the roof without being able to bear the weight, nor should one bear the weight of the state without **virtue/power (德)**.\n\nThe ruler’s possession of the people is like the foundation of a city, the roots of a tree. Deep roots mean a firm foundation, and a thick base means stability above. Therefore, governance that does not rest upon **virtue/power (道德)** cannot be called enduring, and words that do not align with the ancient kings cannot be called the **Dao/Way**. To simply quote and collect the words of others, adopting one method to govern all affairs, is not the universal **Dao/Way**.\n\nLaozi says: The **Dao/Way** of governing people is like **Zhaofu (造父)** guiding his four horses: he harmonizes and unites their reins and bits, aligns their posture with his chest, attains accord within his own heart, and matches it with the will of the horses. Thus, he can take the **Dao/Way** and reach distant places, with his **qi (氣力)** in abundance. In advancing or retreating, turning or bending, all is as he intends—truly mastering the art! Now, **authority and influence (權勢)** are the ruler’s carriage, and great ministers are the ruler’s four horses. The ruler’s body cannot be separated from the carriage’s stability, nor his hands from the hearts of the four horses. Thus, if the four horses are not attuned, **Zhaofu (造父)** cannot take the **Dao/Way**; if the ruler and ministers are not in harmony, even the **sage (聖人)** cannot govern.\n\nTo wield the **Dao/Way** in guiding them, even a mediocre talent can suffice. To clarify distinctions and demonstrate them, even the wicked can be restrained. When things arrive, observe their changes; when matters arise, respond to their transformations. If the near are not disordered, then the far are governed. Without relying on improvised teachings, one attains the **Dao/Way** of nature, and thus all undertakings will not fail.\n\nLaozi says: For all who practice the **Dao/Way**, block the **Dao/Way** of evil, prevent what has not yet occurred, and do not value their own righteousness, but value what cannot be made wrong. Therefore, it is said: *\"Do not allow what is desirable to arise, lest it be sought daily; do not allow what is susceptible to being taken, lest it be contested daily.\"* Thus, human desires will be released, and the **public Dao/Way (公道)** will prevail.\n\nThose with excess follow the measure (**度**), and those lacking are brought up to it (**用**). Thus, the world can be unified. To abandon one’s duties while listening to praise or blame, to forsake merit and labor while relying on factions and cliques—this is why even those with extraordinary talents stagnate in their posts, why ministers of merit contend in court, and why the common people are disordered in the state. Therefore, there is the **Dao/Way** to govern people, but without the **Dao/Way**, one is governed by others.\n\nLaozi says: In governing the state, there are constants, but benefiting the people is the root. In politics and teachings, there is the **Dao/Way**, but current practice should follow antiquity. If it benefits the people, it need not strictly adhere to the ancients; if it addresses the affairs at hand, it need not blindly follow custom. Therefore, the **sage (聖人)** adjusts laws with the times, transforms rites with the people, and makes clothing, instruments, and tools each suitable for their use. Laws and institutions are each adapted to their proper function. Thus, altering the ancients is not necessarily wrong, nor does blindly following custom suffice.\n\nTo recite the books of the ancient kings is not as good as hearing their words; to hear their words is not as good as understanding their intent. Those who understand their intent cannot be fully expressed in words. Therefore, *\"The **Dao/Way** that can be spoken is not the constant **Dao/Way**; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"* The **Dao/Way** by which the **sage (聖人)** acts is like gold and stone: once refined, it cannot be altered. Affairs are like musical instruments: each must be tuned anew at their conclusion. Therefore, laws, institutions, rites, and music are tools of governance, not the governance itself. Hence, rigid scholars cannot be entrusted to discuss the ultimate **Dao/Way**; they are bound by custom and constrained by doctrine.\n\nLaozi says: Is there truly a constant law in the world? It arises from human affairs, reflects human principles, conforms to Heaven and Earth, and delves into the spirits and gods. If one attains this, then governance can be properly ordered.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Three Sovereigns (三皇)** had no laws yet the people followed; the **Five Emperors (五帝)** had laws yet no punishments; the **Xia Dynasty (夏后氏)** did not break their word, the **Yin Dynasty (殷人)** swore oaths, and the **Zhou Dynasty (周人)** made alliances. In the decline of later ages, people endure filth yet scorn humiliation, covet gain yet lack shame. Therefore, laws and institutions are established to regulate the people’s customs and adjust urgency and leniency; tools and implements are adapted to the changes of the times and made suitable for their use.\n\nThose bound by laws cannot be entrusted with distant undertakings; those constrained by rites cannot be made to respond to changes. One must have singular insight and keen hearing to then be able to master the **Dao/Way** and act accordingly. To know the origin of laws, one must adapt to the times and change. To not know the source of governance, even if one follows it, one will still fall into disorder. Now, those who study the **Dao/Way** follow the ancients, cling to traditions, grasp texts and scriptures, and adhere to written laws, hoping to govern thereby. Without this, governance is impossible—like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, seeking suitability is difficult indeed.\n\nTo preserve safety and govern chaos, one must have wisdom. The **Dao/Way** must first be aligned with antiquity; even the foolish will have excess if they do this. Therefore, the **sage (聖人)** does not employ untested methods, nor does the enlightened ruler heed unverified words.\n\n**Wenzi (文子)** asked: *\"Where do laws originate?\"*\nLaozi said: *\"Laws arise from **virtue/power (義)**, and **virtue/power** arises from what is universally fitting. When what is universally fitting aligns with human hearts, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven nor emerge from Earth; they are born from human affairs and return to self-regulation. If one truly attains their root, they will not be disordered in their branches. If one knows their essence, they will not be confused by doubts. If they possess it within themselves, they will not deny it in others. If they do not possess it within themselves, they will not blame those who uphold it.

      "translated_text": "The law is the standard measure of the world and the ruler’s gauge of conduct. Those who set the law determine what is lawful and what is unlawful. Once the law is established, those who conform to it are rewarded, and those who deviate are punished. Even the noble and exalted are not lightly spared their rewards, nor are the lowly burdened with excessive penalties. Those who violate the law, even if they are virtuous, must be punished; those who conform to the measure, even if they are unworthy, are without fault. Thus, when justice prevails, harmony flourishes and discord is stifled.\n\nIn ancient times, officials were appointed to restrain the people from acting at will. The establishment of rulers was to curb officials from acting unilaterally. Laws, measures, and methods were instituted to prevent the ruler from making arbitrary decisions.\n\nWhen no one acts at will, the Dao prevails and order is achieved. Thus, simplicity and non-action are embraced—not because they imply inaction, but because they arise from self-discipline.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: The skilled in rewards expend little yet inspire many; the skilled in punishments spare the use of force yet deter vice. The skilled in giving use frugality yet cultivate virtue; the skilled in taking amass much yet incur no resentment. Therefore, the sage governs by encouraging what the people favor and restraining what they abhor. Reward one, and the world rushes to emulate; punish one, and the world stands in awe. Thus, the greatest rewards are not extravagant, and the severest punishments are not indiscriminate. The sage governs with restraint yet achieves broad influence—this is the way.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: The way of the subject is to debate matters openly, to act first in service, to uphold duty and clarify distinctions, thereby establishing success. When ruler and subject follow different paths, order prevails; when they follow the same, chaos ensues. Each must fulfill their proper role, and all must occupy their rightful place—thus, the superior and inferior may govern one another.\n\nTherefore, branches must not exceed the trunk, nor extremities overpower the root—this is the balance of weight and measure, of great and small, in mutual restraint.\n\nThose who wield authority hold little yet command much, guard few principles yet control broadly. A tree ten spans in girth supports a thousand-jun roof—this is the power of leverage. A five-inch hinge governs the opening and closing of doors—this is the power of position.\n\nOrders given from below must be obeyed: compliance brings benefit, defiance brings ruin. When the world follows without hesitation, it is because the commands align with the natural order. When decrees are issued and prohibitions enforced, it is because the multitude constitutes the force.\n\nJustice does not aim to benefit all under Heaven, yet if one is benefited, the world follows. Tyranny does not aim to harm all within the seas, yet if one is harmed, the world rebels. Thus, every action and decision must be carefully considered.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: To bend an inch is to straighten a foot; a small wrong yields a great right. The sage acts thus. Yet today, rulers judge their ministers by trifling deeds, overlook their grand achievements, and demand minor virtues—this is the path to losing true talent.\n\nThus, those with profound virtue are forgiven their minor faults; those with great reputation are overlooked for their small failings. Human nature inevitably has its flaws, but what matters is their overall conduct. Even if there are minor errors, they should not be held as burdens—what counts is their greater purpose. Neighborly virtue is not to be prized excessively.\n\nTherefore, excessive caution leads to failure, while those who are lax in conduct are shunned by the masses. Those who embody great principles have loose restraints; those who measure vast things earn distant renown. This is the way to judge ministers.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: From ancient times to now, no one has ever been flawless in conduct. Thus, the virtuous do not demand perfection from others. The square is not cut, the sharp is not notched, the straight is not reckless, the broad is not criticized. Moral excellence and martial prowess are not imposed upon others by force, but cultivated through the Dao. To blame others is easy; to cultivate oneself through the Dao is without fault.\n\nEven the *Xia* jade *huang* has its flaws, and the brightest pearl has its blemishes—yet the world treasures them, for minor defects do not mar their great beauty. Today, men fixate on others’ shortcomings, forget their virtues, and yet seek talent in the world—this is difficult indeed.\n\nThe common view focuses on lowly status, humble birth, and ignoble tasks, unaware of a person’s greater purpose. Thus, when judging a man, observe his actions when in power, his generosity when wealthy, his endurance when in poverty, his conduct when in disgrace. Examine his resolve in adversity to gauge his wisdom and courage, his demeanor in joy to test his integrity, his response to wealth to assess his benevolence, his reaction to fear to measure his self-control. Thus, human nature may be known.\n\nThe Master Laozi said: To bend is to seek extension; to be wronged is to seek rectitude. A small wrong yields a great right—the sage acts thus. A hundred rivers flow, yet only those that reach the sea are called valleys. Men pursue diverse paths, yet only those who return to the good are called sages.\n\nWise speech must be practicable; wise action must embody benevolence and righteousness. The sage’s errors, like eclipses of the sun and moon, do not obscure their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act rashly, the courageous do not kill recklessly. They choose carefully and act according to ritual propriety, ensuring that their deeds are accomplished and their reputation secure. Though they possess intelligence and ability, they must root themselves in benevolence and righteousness before standing firm. Intelligence and ability must align with the Dao; the sage uses benevolence and righteousness as the standard. Those who conform are called *junzi*; those who do not are called *xiaoren*.\n\nThe *junzi*, though they die, leave their name undimmed; the *xiaoren*, though they gain power, cannot escape their guilt.\n\nTo hold the map of the world in one hand and slit one’s own throat with the other—even the foolish would not do such a thing. For life is more precious than the world.\n\nTo die for one’s lord and parents is to regard death as returning home—for righteousness is heavier than life itself. Thus, the greatest benefits of the world, when compared to life, are small; yet life, when weighed against righteousness, is light. This is the measure of those who take benevolence and righteousness as their standard.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The completeness of *Dao* and *virtue* is like the sun and moon—barbarians and uncivilized tribes cannot alter their course. Those who follow or reject it alike face praise or blame by convention; those whose intentions and actions are balanced find prosperity or adversity by fortune. When their affairs are thorough in the world, their achievements are fulfilled; when their endeavors align with the times, their names are established.\n\nThus, those who seek to establish功名 simplify their dealings with the world but are meticulous with the times. When the moment arrives, they act without hesitation.\n\nThe ancient warriors did not covet land or riches, but sought to preserve life and pacify chaos, removing harm from the people. Those greedy for gain and excessive in desire ravage the world, causing unrest among the ten thousand households, leaving none at peace in their homes.\n\nWhen a sage arises, they suppress the strong and violent, pacify the turbulent age, and remove harm from the world—transforming filth into purity, danger into security. Thus, they must act decisively.\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor raged like fire, so the Yellow Emperor subdued him; Gōnggōng caused water calamities, so Zhuanxu executed him.\n\nTo teach the *Dao* and guide with *virtue*, yet if they do not listen, then one must confront them with awe and might. If they still do not comply, then one must use arms.\n\nTo kill the innocent and nourish the unrighteous is the greatest harm; to gather the world’s wealth for one’s own desires is the deepest calamity; to indulge one’s own desires while prolonging the suffering of the land—this is what the natural order rejects.\n\nThe reason for establishing rulers is to restrain violence and chaos. Now, seizing the strength of the people only to become tyrants—how can this not be eliminated?\n\nThose who raise fish must remove the *biānshì* (mudfish), those who raise birds and beasts must eliminate the wolves and jackals—how much more so for governing the people!\n\nThus, the origin of arms.\n\nLaozi said: The *Dao* of governing a state is this—no harsh decrees from above, no burdensome administration in office, no deceitful conduct among scholars, no excessive craftsmanship among artisans. Their tasks are fulfilled without disturbance, their tools complete without ornamentation.\n\nIn turbulent times, it is otherwise: those who practice conduct vie to outdo each other in arrogance, those who uphold ritual compete in falsehood. Carriages are extravagantly carved, utensils elaborately inlaid. Those seeking wealth hoard rare treasures as precious, while those criticizing culture pursue frivolous complications as urgent. Matters are debated with sophistry, delayed endlessly without resolution—harmful to governance, beneficial only to chaos. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete, yet they serve no practical purpose.\n\nThus, the *Dao* of Shennong stated: If men of prime do not till the fields, there will be those who starve; if women of their years do not weave, there will be those who freeze. Therefore, the ruler himself plows, his wife weaves, setting an example for the world. In guiding the people, he does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods nor value useless objects.\n\nThus, the plowmen do not strain, for they have enough to sustain life; the weavers do not toil excessively, for they have enough to clothe their bodies. With neither surplus nor deficiency, each attends to their own needs. Clothing and food are abundant, and deceit does not arise. Peaceful and content, the world is harmonious. The wise have no schemes to employ, the brave no valor to display.\n\nLaozi said: The *Dao* of the hegemonic king is this—planned with strategy, mapped with tactics, moved with righteousness, not for mere survival, but to preserve or perish.\n\nThus, when hearing of a ruler oppressing his people, one raises an army to their borders, accusing them of unrighteousness and reproaching their misdeeds.\n\nUpon reaching the outskirts, the general is ordered: Do not cut down trees, do not dig up graves, do not destroy crops, do not burn stores, do not capture civilians, do not seize livestock. Then, the proclamation is issued: The ruler of that land defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, judges unfairly, executes the innocent. Heaven condemns him, the people seek vengeance. The army comes to abolish unrighteousness and enthrone the virtuous. Any who dare defy the *Dao*, disturbing the people, shall be exterminated—root and branch. Those who surrender their families shall be rewarded with their families; those who surrender their neighborhoods shall be rewarded with their neighborhoods; those who surrender their districts shall be ennobled with their districts; those who surrender their counties shall be made lords of their counties.\n\nConquer the state without harming its people. Depose the tyrant, reform the governance, honor the talented, exalt the virtuous, aid the orphans and widows, relieve the poor, release the imprisoned, reward the meritorious. The common folk open their doors to welcome them, offering rice gruel as provisions, fearing they will not come.\n\nA righteous army reaches the border and halts without battle; an unrighteous army arrives with heaps of corpses and rivers of blood, clashing in endless conflict.\n\nThus, those who fight for territory cannot achieve kingship; those who act for self-gain cannot establish their功. Those who undertake deeds for others are aided by the multitude; those who act for themselves are abandoned. Where the multitude moves, even the weak become strong; where the multitude withdraws, even the mighty perish.\n\nLaozi said: The highest ruler governs the state, orders the realm within, practices benevolence and righteousness, spreads virtue and bestows favors, establishes just laws, and blocks wicked paths. Ministers and officials are loyal, the people are harmonious, and all are of one heart. Ministers unite in effort, vassals submit to his authority, and the four quarters revere his virtue. Rectifying the ancestral temple within, he resolves conflicts a thousand *li* beyond. His commands resonate across the land—this is the highest.\n\nNext, there are those with vast lands and numerous people, a wise ruler and capable generals, wealth and strong arms, reliable discipline, and clear orders. When facing equal enemies, before blades are drawn, the foe flees in disarray—this is the middle way.\n\nOthers know the suitability of the land, master the advantages of terrain, discern the shifts of oppressive governance, and understand military formations. Where blades clash and arrows fly, they bear the wounded and gather the slain, with blood staining the earth a thousand *li*—this is the lowest path of arms.\n\nThe victory or defeat of armies lies in governance. If governance prevails over the people, the lower will follow the higher, and the army grows strong. If the people overcome governance, the lower will rebel against the higher, and the army grows weak.",

reverence and accord.\nAt that time, their governance was subtle and profound,\ntheir nature pure and unadorned—\nbefore purity had yet dispersed,\nand all things thrived in great ease.\n\nWhen the age declined to the time of Fu Xi,\nthe world grew dim and laborious,\nall seeking to abandon their childlike innocence,\nto awaken within the expanse of Heaven and Earth—\ntheir virtue became convoluted and fragmented.\n\nWhen it came to Shennong and the Yellow Emperor,\nthey took charge of the world,\nordered the four seasons,\nharmonized yin and yang—\nand thus all the people stood erect in contemplation,\nbowed their heads in listening,\nyet the governance remained unbalanced.\n\nDown to the Xia and Shang dynasties,\nlustful desires reached for all things,\ncleverness was seduced by externals,\nand life’s true nature was lost.\n\nBy the Zhou dynasty,\nthe pure was diluted, the genuine corrupted,\nthe Dao abandoned for artifice,\nvirtue twisted into deceit—\ncrafty intelligence sprouted,\nmonkeys mimicked sages,\nornate falsehoods coerced the masses,\npolished poetry and scriptures were peddled for fame,\neach striving to impose their clever deceits,\nto fit into the world—\nand thus the Great Origin was lost.\nHence, the decline of nature and life has endured for ages.\n\nTherefore, the study of the Perfect Ones\nseeks to return nature to its void,\nto wander the mind in emptiness—\nwhile the world’s scholars\nstrive to refine virtue and constrain nature,\nagitate the five viscera,\nforce action beyond knowledge,\nto clamor for renown—\nthis is what the Perfect Ones do not do.\n\nTo refine virtue is to reveal oneself,\nto constrain nature is to sever life—\nyet the Perfect Ones settle their minds on death and life,\npenetrate the logic of honor and disgrace—\nwhen the world praises them, they are not further encouraged,\nwhen the world condemns them, they are not further deterred—\nfor they have grasped the essence of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said:\nIn ancient times, the sage-kings\ndrew their symbols from Heaven above,\nmeasured their standards from Earth below,\ntook their laws from human nature,\nharmonized the qi of yin and yang,\nbalanced the rhythms of the four seasons,\nobserved the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—\nhigh and low, fertile and barren—\nto establish governance and produce wealth,\nto alleviate hunger and cold,\nto ward off sickness and misfortune.\nThey received the affairs of humanity,\nestablished ritual and music,\npracticed the Way of benevolence and righteousness,\nto order human relationships.\n\nThey arranged the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth,\nto establish the bonds of father and son and form the family;\nthey listened to the pure and impure tones of the five notes and the six pitches,\nto establish the duties of ruler and subject and form the state;\nthey observed the sequence of early, middle, and late in the four seasons,\nto establish the order of seniority and juniority and form the offices.\nThey divided the land into regions,\npartitioned the states for governance,\nestablished the Grand Academy to teach them—\nthese were the fundamental principles of governance.\n\nWhen the Dao was obtained, they acted;\nwhen the Dao was lost, they abandoned it.\nFor nothing ever remains stretched without slackening,\nflourishing without decline—\nonly the sage can flourish without decline.\n\nWhen the sage first created music,\nit was to return the spirit and suppress licentiousness,\nto restore the mind to its natural state.\nBut when it declined,\nit flowed without return,\nindulged in lust and color,\nignored proper law—\nand this corruption spread to later ages,\nleading to the fall of states.\n\nWhen they composed scriptures,\nit was to govern all affairs,\nso the foolish would not forget,\nand the wise would record events.\nBut when it declined,\nthey used them for deceit,\nto exonerate the guilty and condemn the innocent.\n\nWhen they established parks,\nit was to prepare for ancestral temples,\nto inspect soldiers and guard against emergencies.\nBut when it declined,\nthey hunted and fished to exhaust the people’s time,\nto drain their strength.\n\nWhen they honored the worthy,\nit was to level teaching and justice,\nto settle lawsuits—\nthe worthy in office, the capable in their posts,\nfavor flowing to the people,\nall embracing virtue.\nBut when it declined,\ncliques and factions formed,\neach advancing their own,\nabandoning the public for private gain,\ninner and outer factions colluding—\nthe deceitful in power, the worthy in hiding.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth:\nwhen pushed to extremes, it reverses;\nwhen overdone, it diminishes.\nThus, the sage governs by rectifying flaws and altering institutions,\nwhen matters conclude, they change their approach—\ntheir excellence lies in harmony,\ntheir failure in expedience.\n\nThe sage’s Way declares:\nWithout cultivating ritual and righteousness,\nshame and modesty cannot stand—\nif the people lack shame and modesty,\nthey cannot be governed.\nWithout knowing ritual and righteousness,\nlaws cannot be upheld—\nwithout elevating the good and abandoning the base,\nthere is no turning toward ritual and righteousness—\nwithout law, governance is impossible.\nWithout knowing ritual and righteousness,\nlaws cannot be enforced—\nlaws can punish the unfilial,\nbut cannot make people filial;\ncan execute thieves,\nbut cannot make people virtuous.",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, Laozi says: When the world is about to lose its *nature* (性) and *life* (命), it is like the rise of the *yin* (阴) *qi* (氣). The ruler is shrouded in darkness and cannot see clearly, the Dao/Way is abandoned and does not flow, virtue/power is extinguished and does not shine forth. Actions are perverse against Heaven, decrees defy the four seasons, spring and autumn shrink their harmony, and the Earth and Sky strip away their virtue/power. The sovereign sits on his throne but is not at peace, the ministers withdraw in seclusion and do not speak, the officials follow the ruler’s whims and destroy the norms, estranging kin and seeking self-preservation. The wicked flatter while plotting in secret, and swiftly they load the arrogant lord with luxuries, mirroring his chaos to accomplish their schemes. Thus, the ruler and ministers grow estranged and unkind, kin are alienated and unfaithful, fields yield no crops, roads offer no respite, stored grain rots and walls crumble, tortoiseshells and jades are hollowed out, divination is practiced daily, yet the world remains fractured—one family does not suffice. The feudal lords impose laws and customs that diverge, uprooting the roots and abandoning the foundation. They carve the five punishments, sharpening them like blades, contending over the minutiae of law while slaughtering the common folk, taking half their lives. They raise armies to make war, assaulting cities with wanton slaughter, overturning the high and secure, deploying massive siege chariots, erecting towering ramparts, and clearing battlefields into death traps. They provoke fierce enemies, and when the people rise in rebellion, their reputation is but a fleeting pretense. They conquer lands and states, leaving heaps of corpses numbering tens of thousands, while the aged and weak perish from hunger and cold beyond count. From this point onward, the world has never truly found peace in its *nature* (性) and *life* (命), nor joy in its customs.\n\nThe worthy and sagely then arise in tumult, upholding virtue/power and Dao/Way, reinforcing benevolence and righteousness. They enlighten the near with wisdom and embrace the far with virtue/power, unifying the world so that generations succeed in aiding one another, dismissing slanderous flatterers and silencing baseless rumors. They abolish the harsh punishments, remove burdensome decrees, block idle gossip, and seal the gates of factionalism. They suppress cleverness, follow the great norms, topple superficial structures, and cast aside sharp minds. They open the path to great harmony and confusion, allowing all things to return to their original roots.\n\nThe sage does not create the times; when the times come, he does not fail to respond. Thus, he is never left without purpose. Laozi says: The depth of the *Ying* (酆) waters reaches ten *ren* (仞) yet it does not receive filth, for gold and jade lie within, their forms visible without—it is not that the waters are not deep and pure, but that fish, turtles, dragons, and serpents do not dwell there. On stone, no grains grow; on barren hills, no deer roam, for there is no shelter or shade. Therefore, governance marked by severity is mistaken for insight, ruthlessness for clarity, rigid cruelty for loyalty, and intricate schemes for merit. Such rule is like the vastest hide being stripped—it is the path of utter collapse. When governance is stifling, the people are simple; when governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\n\nLaozi says: Govern with virtue/power, wage war with the Dao/Way. First establish governance that cannot be overcome, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack the ungoverned with the disordered is like answering fire with fire or water with water—like cannot cure like, so the Dao/Way relies on difference for its efficacy. Calmness becomes the opposite of agitation, order the opposite of chaos, fullness the opposite of hunger, ease the opposite of toil, and uprightness the opposite of perversion. If these opposites correspond—like water and fire, metal and wood clashing against one another—where can one not prevail? Thus, when virtue/power is balanced, the many overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise subdue the foolish; and when wisdom is equal, those with strategy capture those without.»\n\n---\n*(Annotations preserved in brackets for *性* (nature/life-force) and *命* (fate/life), but otherwise omitted per guidelines.)*",
