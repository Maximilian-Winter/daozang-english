  "full_translation": "*The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Teachings on Registering Names for Protection by the Western Dipper*\n\nThe *Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Teachings on Registering Names for Protection by the Western Dipper* is of uncertain authorship, approximately dating to the early Northern Song dynasty. It is pseudepigraphically attributed to the Supreme Lord Lao, who transmits it to the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, recounting the rites of beseeching the Western Dipper Emperor Lord for disaster aversion. It comprises one scroll.\n\nSource of the base text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Empyrean*, *Category of Original Texts*.\n\n---\n\n*The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Lord’s Teachings on Registering Names for Protection by the Western Dipper*\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Lord Lao descended upon Shu’s capital. On the seventh day of the first month in the second year of the Yongshou era, having expounded the *Scripture of Longevity of the Eastern Dipper* to the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, he again descended upon Shu’s capital on the fifteenth day of the same month. At midnight, a numinous radiance illuminated thousands of *li*, the earth as smooth as water. A white jade terrace floated within the void of the firmament, where the Supreme Lord, leaning upon his armrest, summoned the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master and declared:\n\n“I possess the *True Scripture of the Mysterious Origin and Great Sage of the Western Dipper*, a treasure of the heavens above, which delivers boundless beings. The Lords of the Five Celestial Convergences and the Numinous Dipper hold the mandate of heaven—none may be lacking. I have observed that the merits and transgressions, gains and losses, deaths and lives of all beings are invariably recorded by the Bureau of the Great Register of the Western Dipper. It meticulously tallies the names of those destined for deliverance among the world’s recipients, their fate and destiny accounted without the slightest deviation. Thus, I have repeatedly bestowed upon you sacred talismans. Only the Emperor Lord of the Great Register of the Western Dipper records human goodness and transgressions, inscribing their merits and faults. Now, I shall expound this scripture for you, that it may be transmitted to the world, enabling you to fully attain the Dao of the Five Heavens, the celestial texts, and the numinous essence of the Five Primes, ascending naturally and delivering limitless beings.”\n\nThe Supreme Lord addressed the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, saying: “The Mysterious Origin is formless, boundless, and profoundly obscure; the Great Image is non-action. Among the revered numina of the Five Dippers, only the Great Emperor of the West holds the handle of heaven, wielding awe-inspiring commands to subdue demons with divine might. He oversees the execution of punishments both within and without, scrutinizing the forms of hidden and malevolent spirits. Below, he records the deeds of mortals—goodness is inscribed, evil is noted. Names and designations scatter and diverge, while the bounds of life and death perpetually revolve through eight hundred thousand myriads of cycles. He illuminates the realms of the Three Wretched States, the Five Sufferings, the Ten Lands, and the Nine Springs. All who come and go must pass through the registers of the directional assemblies. Vast and resplendent records tally the multitudes of spirits, and none receive deliverance except by this means. By the mandate of the Supreme Mystery, the Emperor Lord of the Western Dipper—within the Supreme Numinous Treasury, I have witnessed the celestial hymns and cavernous texts, treasures of heaven so secret none may hear them. Now, as you uphold the Great Dao, I shall reveal to you the *Scripture of the Great Register of the Western Dipper*.”\n\n“If one can revere it with utmost sincerity and transmit it through recitation, their name shall be inscribed in the jade registers of the Mysterious Records, their merits recorded. This shall ascend to the heavens, where the celestial departments shall monitor and confer it. Upon hearing the report, the Supreme Mystery shall, in accordance with their name, deliver them from the world. Names bear goodness or evil; actions entail merit or transgression—all is manifest and unhidden, recorded in the Mysterious Registers. I now bestow upon you the numinous tones of the Western Dipper, that they may circulate in the world, rescuing and delivering the shades of the netherworld. These are the chapters of the utmost truth, universally delivering boundless beings.”\n\nThe Supreme Lord said: “The celestial Dao is ever constant in its image. The Western Dipper records names, neither silent nor resounding, profoundly mysterious in the Supreme Clarity. The Great Emperor of Supreme Might commands ten thousand myriads of divine soldiers, wielding golden axes beneath the vast heavens—who dares linger? Slaying and annihilating demonic spirits and malevolent essences, I am flanked by Yuan Rong on the left and Xuan Ying on the right, summoning grand assemblies to command demonic forms. Mortals’ destinies, entwined with life and death, their roots of goodness and evil coiled and entangled—flying celestial divine kings illuminate my radiance. Upon the talismanic registers, every detail is meticulously noted. I possess cavernous chapters of utmost sageliness and primordial numen. Those who attain them shall ascend when the time comes; those who uphold them shall pass through the gates of the Primordial Court. The netherwork’s true silence and the great brilliance of the luminous stars—\n\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances of the Supreme Lord!*\n\n**Incantation:**”\n\nSilent clarity, emptiness merging with stillness—rooted in the Dao.\nSupreme beyond all supremacy, the Purple Tenuity Lord Emperor.\nWithin the true resides the numinous; the mysterious scriptures’ rightful spirits.\nMyriad billions of divine soldiers, arrayed in vast and intricate order.\nIlluminating and commanding with radiant authority, they govern the human body.\nFrom primordial dawn to final dusk, the Grand August Lofty Perfected.\n\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances!*\n\nThe White Standard Perfected Lord of the First Western Dipper,\nThe Lofty Origin Perfected Lord of the Second Western Dipper,\nThe Regal Numen Perfected Lord of the Third Western Dipper,\nThe Mighty Might Perfected Lord of the Fourth Western Dipper.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: Whoever recites this sutra must first purify themselves through fasting and ablution, still the body in silence, and stand facing west. Strike the teeth four times, then prostrate with utmost sincerity, first invoking the Great Sage Lord Emperor of the Western Dipper twenty-one times before reciting the sutra. For all petitions, supplications, or rites to avert calamity, perform them on one’s fate-day, or on the seventh, ninth, or fifteenth day of the month. Prepare an altar, no less than seven inches nor more than seven feet in height, nine feet square, and raise a banner of seven feet of uncut silk inscribed with the name of the Great Sage Lord Emperor of the Western Dipper at its top. Array rare treasures or various fragrant flowers upon the altar. Whether in the household or a Daoist abbey, conduct the pure offering at midnight, welcoming and prostrating to the Lord Emperor. Present your petitions facing west, bowing in reverence, and recite the true sutra in secret—none shall fail to be answered. It lengthens goodness and severs evil, inscribing names in the heavens. Those who hear its numinous sound shall be untouched by the ten thousand disasters. Subtle and wondrous is this sutra, immeasurably delivering beings.\n\nWhen the Most High had finished expounding the sutra, he addressed the Heavenly Master once more: “The profound mysteries of the Western Dipper—you have fully attained them. Transmit them to the world below, but do not treat its words lightly. Those who faithfully receive and practice it shall sever death and continue life. After seventy thousand years in the radiant luminaries, I shall once more expound these supreme mysteries here.”\n\nWhen the Lord Lao had concluded his revelation, his voice faded into silence, as if present yet absent, his whereabouts unknown. The Heavenly Master received it and transmitted it to the world.\n\nThus concludes *The Most High’s Scripture of the Western Dipper’s Recorded Names for Wondrous Protection of the Body*.",
