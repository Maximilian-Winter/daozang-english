*Golden Talisman Tenfold Invocation and Closing Rites for the Liberation of All Beings at Early Morning, Midday, and Evening across Three Sessions*)\n\n**One scroll.**\n\nSource: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozāng* (Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Treasury), *Dòngxuān Bù* (Section on Mysterious and Transcendent Teachings), under **Rites of Majesty and Awe** (*Wēiyí Lèi*).\n\n---\n\n**Golden Talisman Tenfold Invocation and Closing Rites for the Liberation of All Beings at Midday**\n*(After the solemn vow of fasting)*\n\n**Threefold Refuge** (*Sānupratishṭhāna*)\n**Sūtra of Past Lives** (*Shùmìng Zàn*)\n**Invocation of the Fivefold Session to Open the Scripture**\n\nWith reverence, I humbly present:\n*\"By the auspicious realm of the soaring jade and triumphant longevity,*\n*I transcend the formless realm [of the Pure Land].*\n*Within the verdant expanse where the [celestial] mists float,*\n*I attain the primordial blue sky.*\n\nIn ancient times, when the **Celestial Worthy** (*Xūhuáng*) was about to expound the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*),\nHe convened a grand assembly and spoke this **scripture** (*jīng*) here.\nAt first, ascending the **Lion Throne** (*Shīzuò*), its tenfold circuit [of recitation]\nStill allowed one to hear its teachings;\nBut once entering the **Grain of Millet** (*Shǔzhū*) [i.e., the profound mysteries],\nA single true secret remains—\nWho can truly discern it?\n\nThis is called the **symbol beyond symbols** (*xiàngwài zhī xiàng*),\nThe **essence within essences** (*yào shí xuánzhōng zhī xuán*).\n\nNow, with awe, I follow the **Imperial Edict** (*Lún yīn*),\nDevoutly observing the **Golden Talisman** (*Jīn lù*),\nAnd extending the **auspicious fast** (*Yí zhāi*) for several days and nights.\n\nNow, I lead the assembled officials,\nAscending the altar for the **fifth session** (*dìwǔ huì*),\nTo recite in rotation the **Supreme Scripture of Mysterious and Transcendent Treasures, the Precious Scripture for the Boundless Liberation of All Beings** (*Tàishàng Dòngxuān Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*),\nPay homage to the **Precious Decrees** (*Bǎo guì*),\nAnd with utmost reliance, turn to the **Incomparable Triple Jewel** (*Wúshàng Sānbǎo*—the **Dao/Way** (*Dào*), **Virtue/Power** (*Dé*), and **Scriptures** (*Jīng*)),\nThe **Compassionate Saints of the Ten Directions** (*Shífāng zhūtiān Dàshèng*),\nAnd the **merciful vows of all beings** (*cíbēi yuànlì*),\nTo preside over the **meritorious work** (*jīnggōng*) of this **scripture** (*jīng*).\n\nMay it be that the **Purple Dawn’s** (*Zǐyáng*) hidden texts are revealed,\nAnd the **Primordial Beginning’s** (*Yuánshǐ*) forbidden scriptures are unveiled.\nMay all beings be enlightened and illuminated,\nAnd brilliance shine upon the ten thousand things!\"\n\n«The jade and coral chime resound,\nNaturally forming the hollow sound of the void;\nThe Milky Way divides its chapters,\nPiercingly revealing the colors of the boundless expanse.\n\nAll sentient beings, all aware,\nSee and hear it all.\n\nWith reverent obeisance, we take refuge,\nAnd practice the scriptures' Dao/Way.\n\nWe spread our seats and chant,\nUpon completion of the sutra, we dissolve our seats and chant,\nAnd dedicate the merit.\n\nNow, Your servant, with utmost respect,\nOffers that all things—from creation’s end to its beginning—\nAre governed by the **Kun** (*Gèn*) direction;\nThe five phases, in their birth and completion,\nUltimately return to the earthly element.\n\nAt the season of spring’s arrival,\nThe **vital qi** should surge and ascend.\nFor within, the **yang** is contained,\nAnd without, the **yin**—here, they first harmonize in **Tai** (*Tài*).\n\nSince life first took form and nature was borne,\nWhat fear is there that it will not flourish and complete?\n\nYour servant, having just led the assembled officials,\nAscended the platform for the fifth recitation of the *Boundless Liberation of All Beings* (*Tàishàng Dòngxuān Língbǎo Wúliàng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*),\nDirectly offers merit to the **Supreme Primordial Lord of the Dao/Way** (*Wújí Tàishàng Língbǎo Tiānzūn*) of the northeast,\nThe **Noble Lord of Purple Clarity and Descending Blessings** (*Zǐqīng Jiàngfú Tiānzūn*),\nThe **Primordial Azure Celestial Sovereign of the Northeast** (*Dōngběi Shǐqīng Fànqì Tiānzūn*),\nThe **Celestial Illumination Star Lord of the Primordial One and Purple Qi** (*Tiānyī Zǐqì Dàoyào Xīngzūn*),\nThe **Celestial Phoenix Star Lord of the Tail Constellation** (*Wěisù Tiānjī Xīngzūn*),\nThe **Celestial Star Lord of the Dipper Constellation at the Heavenly Ford** (*Jīsù Tiānjīn Xīngzūn*),\nThe **Celestial Star Lord of the Dipper Constellation at the Heavenly Temple** (*Dǒusù Tiānmìao Xīngzūn*),\nThe **Celestial Star Lord of the Ox Constellation and Heavenly Mechanism** (*Niúsù Tiānjī Xīngzūn*),\nThe **Divine Swallows of the Two Mansions of Chou and Yin** (*Chǒuyín Èr Guāng Huàngyàn Fēnyuè Lièwèi Xīngzūn*) and their constellations,\nThe **Noble Deities of the Two Mansions of Mo and Ji** (*Mójiè Èr Guāng Zūnshén*),\nThe **Supreme Primordial Great God of the Northeast** (*Dōngběi fāng Wújí Wúliàng Pǐn Zhìzhēn Dàshén*),\nThe **Long-Lived Celestial Sovereign of the Flying Immortals and the Great Saint of Boundless Liberation** (*Fēitiān Shénwáng Chángshēng Dàshèng Wúliàng Dùrén Zūn*),\nThe **Noble Deities of the Current Year Star and Auspicious Horse** (*Běnmìng Tàisuì Lùmǎ Zūnshén*),\nAnd the **Divine Officials of the Purple Hall and the Celestial Constellations** (*Zǐtáng Shénshà Guānzhòng*),\n\nAs the **fasting platform** responds to the blessings of all true spirits.\n\nWe beseech that through the **merit and power of the sutra** (*jīnggōng yuànlì*),\nLongevity and prosperity be extended,\nAnd years of life be added and multiplied.\n\nMay the Five Stars align in harmony,\nAnd the Nine Luminaries proceed in order! »\n\n**Translation:**\n\nThe **Purple Qi** pours into the Dipper and Ox,\nAuspicious omens descend to Earth’s treasure;\nEast Wei rides upon the Tail and Arrow,\nHeroes ascend to supplement the Celestial Officials.\n\nBy doing good, a hundred blessings descend,\nBy establishing the Pole, the Five Auspicious Virtues unfold.\n\nWith reverence, I take refuge and chant in rotation.\n\n**Hymn of Wisdom and Benevolence**\nLearning the Dao begins with sincere faith,\nServing the Master as one’s closest kin.\nDrawing inspiration from the Pure Void,\nDiligently renewing each day.\n\nWhile others remain unenlightened,\nI shall not cross over alone.\nGreat vows demand great recompense,\nThe Mystic Virtue shall shine forth.\n\nFor deep sins of darkness,\nFacing judgment like the turning wheel,\nI humbly offer incense to the **Noble Sage of the Northeast**,\nProclaiming the **Sixfold Recitation of the Scripture**,\nBurning the **Sacred Talismans of Propagation**.\n\nWith reverence, I declare:\nAmong the **Thirty-Six Heavens of the Nine Realms**, none surpasses the **True King, Great Emperor**;\nThe **Sixty-One Volumes of Liberation** all stem from the **Boundless Original Scripture**.\n\nFor though some may specialize in a single teaching,\nHere, all are encompassed by the **One Vehicle’s essence**.\n\nPracticing Dao and cultivating the Way,\nExtraordinary merit is achieved.\nProtecting the nation and bringing peace to the family,\nThe True Law is preserved.\n\nFor roots stretch deep, waves surge wide,\nAnd great foundations bear vast branches.\n\nNow, I humbly follow the Imperial Edict,\nReverently crafting the **Golden Talismans**,\nExtending the **Great Auspicious Fast** for days and nights.\n\nWith the assembled officials, I ascend the platform,\nFor the **Sixth Recitation** of the *Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Mystic Treasure—Boundless Liberation, Supreme Grade, Marvelous Scripture*,\nPaying homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,\nRelying on the **Three Precious Ones of Supreme Compassion** and the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints**,\nTheir mercy and vows sustaining the merit of the scripture.\n\nMay Heaven open this Way,\nAnd the Emperor guide the sincere.\n\nInstantly grasp the profound meaning,\nJoyfully aligning with the natural order;\nHearing the sacred words in six recitations,\nIlluminated as if scales fall from the eyes.\n\nBlessings extend to the realm and family,\nJoy spreads to the borders and defenses.\nWitnessing the gathered assembly of the Law,\nThe marvelous sounds resound with divine power.\n\nWith reverence, I bow to the **Celestial Sovereign**,\nPracticing the scriptural teachings.\n\n**Seated Chant:**\nAfter reciting the scripture, I sing.\n\n**Dissolving the Seat Chant: Returning the Merit**\n\nWith reverence, I now return the merit,\nAs the Six Chants call forth the southeast—\nThe *Xun* trigrams’ qi, harmonious and bright.\n\nIn time, it is summer’s first dawn,\nWhen all things are pure and aligned;\nIn number, the waters complete,\nReturning to the One, the source’s embrace.\n\nThrough supreme learning’s alchemical art,\nThe marvel lies in *Liquan*’s flowing grace—\nThus teeth regrow where once they fell,\nAs jade’s essence nourishes the *Cilia*’s core;\nHair darkens where it turned to silver,\nAs golden essence ascends to the elbow’s glow.\n\nIf one knows the Dao’s profound return,\nThen the Way of divine transformation is known.\n\nNow, having led the officials in chanting\nThe *Sixth Universal Recitation* of the\n*Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure—\nThe Marvelous Scripture for Delivering Beings,*\n\nI direct the merit to the southeast—\nTo the **Supreme Celestial Sovereign of Boundless Treasure**,\nThe **Celestial Sovereign of Longevity and Life-Preservation**,\nThe **Celestial Lord of Azure-Qi and Divine Breath**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Divine Tail and Falling Radiance**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Winged Constellation and Celestial Capital**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Imperial Enclosure and Heavenly Seat**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Chariot Constellation and Celestial Street**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Horn Constellation and Heavenly Gate**,\nThe **Star Lord of the Hyades and Celestial Court**,\nThe **Divine Lords of the *Chen* and *Yi* Mansions**,\nThe **Star Lords of the *Zheng* and *Chu* Lunar Divisions**,\nThe **Divine Lords of the *Tianping* and *Shuangnu* Mansions**,\nThe **Supreme Great God of Boundless Truth in the Southeast**,\nThe **Flying Heavenly King, the Great Sage of Boundless Deliverance**,\nThe **Lords of the Native Year and Auspicious Horse**,\nThe **Purple Hall Star Gods and Official Spirits**,\nAnd all responsive true spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nI pray that through the merit and power of the scripture,\nThe southeast’s **Longevity Star in the Quail’s Tail** may be pacified,\nExtending blessings and auspicious signs,\nIncreasing years and refining fate.\n\nMay the Three Lights shine forth,\nAnd the Five Constants return to harmony.\n\nThe **Dragon’s Horn** mansion—when the Dipper’s handle brightens, it heralds auspicious signs;\nWithin the **Quail’s Tail**, when the stars disperse in order, they form the foundation of blessings.\n\nWith bowed reverence, I take refuge and turn to chant in praise.\n\n**Ode to Wisdom and Enlightenment**\nLearning the Dao is indeed arduous,\nYet morning and evening, one cultivates the Field of Merit.\nPlanting virtue is like nurturing trees—\nLayer by layer, it grows into mountains.\nIf one can dwell upon the Mysterious and Lofty,\nThen like a breeze, one ascends to the Azure Sky.\nPracticing this Dao of Non-Action,\nOne forever binds ties with the Good.\n\nThis is the *Supreme Most Hidden Scripture*,\nNamed the *Chapter of Wisdom*.\n\nA land’s prosperity stems from great talent,\nAscending beyond the mundane to attain immortality.\nA divine form, rare in the world,\nResplendent as a lotus in the depths.\n\n**Highest Merit to the Southeast—Reverently Declared**\nWith solemn incense, I proclaim the sacred scriptures,\nSevenfold recitation of the opened text.\nWith humble reverence, I present the *Lingbao Original Chapter*,\nThe *Secret Canon of the Mysterious Capital*.\n\nWhen its five sections unfold,\nThey possess the power to pacify Heaven and stabilize Earth;\nWhen its ten thousand precepts are revealed,\nThey hold the force to guide the cosmic flow and govern the age.\n\nWhy then is this scripture named *Degree of People*?\nIs it not because humans are the most refined of all things,\nAnd thus the ruler must be the sovereign of all under Heaven?\nHumans are the most noble of the Three Powers—\nWithout them, how could one perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth?\nThus, its name is fitting, and its analogy profound.\n\nNow, I humbly follow Your edict,\nReverently crafting the Golden Talismans,\nAnd extend the Grand Auspicious Fast for days and nights.\n\nNow, I lead the assembled spirits,\nAscending the platform for the seventh recitation of the\n*Supreme Most Daoist *Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of Boundless Degree of People*,\nThe Supreme Excellent Scripture*,\nPaying homage to the sacred decrees,\nAnd relying upon the boundless compassion of the Supreme Three Jewels,\nThe Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints,\nTheir mercy and vows—\nMay the merit of the scripture prevail.\n\nI pray that the Dao’s transformation may flourish,\nAnd the Mysterious Wind be greatly revived.\nMay those lost in obscurity and confusion\nEventually resonate with the profound and subtle blessings.\nMay the nation’s destiny be steadfast and secure,\nAnd blessings and auspicious signs be granted.\nWhat is wished for is obtained without seeking.\n\nOn the platform, the assembled ritualists\nResound with the sacred, resonant sounds of the law.\nWith bowed reverence to the Celestial Sovereign,\nI practice the scriptural methods.\n\n**Seated Chant**\nHaving completed the recitation of the scripture.\n\n**Dismounting Chant**\n**Transfer of Merit**\n\nWith reverence, I nourish the Earth with offerings,\nAnd return my form to the soil.\n\nThe Great Fire is forged from the Seven Qi,\nWhile the spirit is nourished by the Heart Sovereign.\n\nWithin, I refine the method of cultivating qi,\nWithout, I exhaust the art of nourishing the body.\nWhen I strike the drum, my hair turns youthful and my teeth grow firm—\nThen transform into a crimson visage.\nThough my bones were weak and sinews soft,\nNow I stand with robust strength.\n\nIndeed, the scripture’s singular effects\nAre but the same benevolence of the Sage’s transformation.\n\nJust now, I led the officials in ascending the platform,\nReciting the *Supreme Dao/Way’s Mysterious Treasure of Boundless Salvation for Humans—The Supreme Scripture* in its seventh cycle.\nDirectly, I transfer merit to:\n\nThe **Supreme Soul Treasure Celestial Venerable of the Boundless Southwest**,\nThe **Celestial Venerable of Boundless Blessing in the Southwest**,\nThe **Primordial White Dao/Way’s Celestial Qi Sovereign**,\nThe **Celestial Enclosure Imperial Seat Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Great Unity Moon’s Dark Luminous Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Tianxiù Celestial Screen Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Shen宿 Celestial Water Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Jing宿 Celestial Well Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Gui宿 Celestial Feast Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Shen-Wei Two Mansions Venerable Deities**,\nThe **Supreme Most True Great God of the Boundless Southwest**,\nThe **Flying Heaven Divine King of Longevity, the Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,\nThe **Native Star Year’s Auspicious Horse Venerable Deity**,\nThe **Purple Hall Spirit Officials and Attendants**,\nAnd all responsive true spirits of the Three Realms.\n\nI beseech that through the merit and vow of the scripture,\nThe **Quèwěi constellation** in the southwest may be steadied,\nLife preserved and years extended,\nAuspicious omens welcomed and blessings gathered.\n\nMay I pray that auspicious signs illuminate the celestial realm,\nTheir light shining upon the human world.\n\nThe **Celestial Well** guards the **Feast** and the **Room**,\nFollowing the **Dao**’s course through the star degrees;\nThe **Beak** and **Three Stars** govern the **Big Dipper**,\nWondrously revolving at the **Heavenly Pass**.\n\nAuspicious blessings pair in the **Command Palace**,\nNoble fortunes ever uphold the **Destiny Limit**.\n\nWith bowed head, I take refuge and turn to chant.\nThe **Wisdom Praise** speaks:\n*\"Each person’s path has its root,\nAll born of past-life merit.\nEstablish virtue while time allows,\nSpeak vows—none shall be denied.\nGood and evil await their turn,\nRise and fall by logic’s unseen depth.\nThe worthy scholar follows the **Dao**’s words,\nYet the **Way** itself lies in forgetting all.\"*\n\nThis is the **Great Wisdom**—\nTo the **Supreme Ultimate Sage** above,\nA **Jade-Covered Chariot** links with the **Celestial Carriage**,\nCommanding the **Nine Dragons** in procession.\n**Gold and leather** bear the **Sacred Scripture**,\nYouthful immortals present the fragrant incense.\n\nSongs and melodies resound in the **Mysterious Capital**,\nJade chimes strike the **Lapis Lazuli Bell**.\n\nWith solemn rites to the **Southwest**,\nI humbly proclaim and solemnly declare:\n*\"The **Sacred Text** is opened wide—\nThough it embodies the **Boundless Salvation** of the **Great Sage**,\nThe **Inner Dao** of the **Immortal Way** holds the **Divine Transformation**’s power.\nSince the **Five-Zhang Pearl** hangs high in its celestial court,\nIt already contains the **Nine Refinements** of **Gold and Mercury**’s alchemy.\nWhen the sun and moon pause their light,\nIt is the silent, luminous hour;\nWhen mountains hide their clouds,\nIt is the breath’s slow, endless flow.\"*\n\nThe **Three Corpses** perish, and the **Three Realms** stand guard;\nThe **Five Qi** are refined, and the **Five Emperors** await their welcome.\n\nWhen the **Mysterious Pearl** elixir is perfected,\nThe **Sage’s** sacred work is complete—\nThe **Golden Chamber** grants passage to the **Celestial Gate**,\nAnd the **Jade Tablets** record the name for the **Jade Capital’s** feasts.\n\nNow I drink the **Imperial Edict’s** decree,\nReverently crafting the **Golden Talismans**,\nExtending the **Auspicious Fast** for days and nights.\n\nI lead the **official assembly**,\nAscending the platform for the **eighth circuit** of recitation—\nThe *Supreme Dao/Way’s **Mysterious Treasure Soul-Jewel Sutra of Boundless Salvation***,\nBowing to the **Sacred Edicts**, relying on the **Supreme Triple Jewel’s** merciful sovereign,\nThe **Ten Directions’** great sages—\nTheir compassionate vows sustain the **Sutra’s** power.\n\nHumbly, I pray to ride the **Three Pure Ones’** clouds,\nTo bear the **Nine-Luminous** effigy upon my neck.\nThe **Black Tortoise and Hare** dwell in unity within one chamber,\nWhile the **Lion and Crane** stand guard in the four quarters.\n\nNow, with mouth reciting and heart contemplating,\nWe enter the **Great Measure’s** profound depths;\nDivine communion and intuitive understanding\nAwaken the **Ultimate Stillness’s** boundless mechanism.\n\nMay all sentient beings equally attain **unerring enlightenment**,\nAnd the **congregation of the Law** resound with **mystic harmonies**.\n\nWith deepest reverence to the **Void Sovereign**,\nWe practice the **Sutra’s** sacred method.\n\nThe **Seat is spread**—\nThe **Sutra** is chanted to its close.\n\n**Dissolving the Seat and Turning Merit**\n\nWith reverence, I align my heart with Heaven and Earth’s nurturing of all life—\nMy merit complete, I do not rule over them.\nThe **Lingbao** teaches salvation for all beings, its Dao boundless in its reach.\nThus, the **Sutra’s** power circles the eight extremes,\nIts patterns mirroring the **Primordial Dao’s** singular transformation.\n\nEach now upright in **nature and fate**,\nAll shall equally attain **birth and fulfillment**.\nFrom high to low, from vast to minute—\nForm and hue arise without division;\nConceived in womb, egg, or damp—\nNone perish, none decay—what cause for worry?\nDivine wonders! The **Mystic Virtue** is vast indeed.\n\nNow, I lead the officials and congregation,\nAscending the platform to recite the **Supreme Dao’s *Lingbao Scripture of Boundless Salvation for All Beings, Supreme Grade of Wondrous Perfection***—\nThe **Eighth Chapter**—\nAnd turn its merit toward:\nThe **Supreme Lingbao Sovereign of the Boundless** in the **Western-Northern Quarter**,\nThe **Nine-Palace Guardian Sovereigns of the Western-Northern Quarter**,\nThe **Primordial Mystic Dao’s Celestial Qi Sovereign**,\nThe **Celestial Enclosure Emperor’s Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Divine-Headed Luo**’s **Radiant Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Xiù Constellation’s Heavenly Granary Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Bì Constellation’s Heavenly Market Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Kuí Constellation’s Heavenly Marshal Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Lóu Constellation’s Heavenly Prison Star Sovereign**,\nThe **Xū and Hài Constellations’ Ru and Wei Star Sovereigns of the Two Palaces**,\nThe **Emperor Gods of the White Ram and Pisces Constellations**,\nThe **Supreme Most True Great God of the Boundless Western-Northern Quarter**,\nThe **Flying Heaven Divine King, Long-Living Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,\nThe **Native Year Star and Luck-Horse Sovereign Gods**,\nThe **Purple Hall Spirit Officials and the Assembly of the Ritual Platform**—\nAll responsive celestial spirits.\n\nI beseech, through the **Sutra’s** merit and my vows,\nTo pacify the **Western-Northern Quarter**,\nTo descend upon the **Lóu and Chī**’s abodes,\nTo preserve life and extend years,\nTo invite auspiciousness and bring blessings.\n\nMay the **Divine Talismans** settle the **Ru and Wei** divisions,\nMay the **Celestial Patterns** brighten the **Kuí and Bì** stars.\nWithin the **Star Constellations of fate**,\nLet auspicious omens ever flourish;\nIn the **years, months, days, and hours of adversity**,\nLet all transform into **prosperity and rectitude**.\nWhatever is guarded by **action** shall be without calamity or harm.\n\nWith deepest reverence, I take refuge and turn to chant praise.\n\n**Ode of Wisdom**\n\nMy body soars beyond the **Great Void**,\nAscending the **Purple Clarity** in boundless ease.\nI uphold the **Primordial Essence**, the **Law’s** unyielding thread,\nWandering the **Mystic Peak** in carefree flight.\nTen thousand kalpas pass like yesterday’s night,\nA thousand springs unfold like morning’s dawn.\nTowering clouds shade my **Lingbao** grove,\nMy hand grasps the **Treasure Forest’s** boughs.\nIncense smoke arises naturally,\nThe **Mystic Stairs** stir the **Whirling Ascension**.\nThe **Divine Banners** ride the wind’s command,\nDissolving all fleeting thoughts in their wake.\nExtinguishing **worldly wisdom**, I expand the **Great Unity**,\nIn **Non-Action**, I sing the **Pure Song**.\n\n**Humbly Declared to the Western-Northern Quarter**—\n**Proclaimed and Recorded for the Sacred Offerings**.\n\n**The Threefold Hearings of the Sutra—\nTaking the Vow, Rekindling the Furnace, Descending the Altar,\nOffering Thanks to the Master, Returning in Circle,\nReciting the Golden Arrow Ten Times to Liberate Beings.**\n\n**At noon, the grand ritual concludes.**",
