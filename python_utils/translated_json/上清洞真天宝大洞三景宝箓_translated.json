  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Cavern-Real Heavenly Treasure Great Cavern Three Radiance Precious Register**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Cavern-Real Heavenly Treasure Great Cavern Three Radiance Precious Register*\n**Author:** Unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Compiled from four early Supreme Clarity School registers: *The Most High Golden Tiger Talisman Register*, *The Most High Flying Steps of the Empty Constant Register*, *The Most High Two Radiance Three Swift Registers*, and *The Most High Mysterious Register of Tortoise Mountain*. Two scrolls in total.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Cavern-Real Heavenly Treasure Great Cavern Three Radiance Precious Register*, Scroll One\n\n#### **The Most High Lord Emperor’s Golden Tiger Talisman Register**\n**Jade Clarity Rank, First Grade**\n\nOn the day of [X] in the month of [X] in the year of [X] of the Great Era, [X] of [X] prefecture, [X] county, [X] village, [male/female disciple], named [X], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month at the [X] hour, now presents offerings and sincerity to the Master of the Three Caverns, [X], to receive *The Most High Lord Emperor’s Golden Tiger Talisman Register*. After receiving and wearing it, one must uphold and cultivate it in accordance with the precepts, never lightly disclosing or defiling its sacred writ. Should one violate this, they shall bear divine punishment, unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas. If cultivated in accordance with the Dao, one shall attain immortality in both life and death, as bound by the covenant and statutes.\n\nThe **True Talisman of the Golden Tiger and Jade Essence of the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity** is the innate golden scripture of the Supreme Primordial’s Upper Radiance. It commands golden immortals, seals mountains, summons spirits, overawes the Six Heavens, and annihilates the myriad demons. The Most High ever deploys the Four Numinous Beasts, the Six Jia Spirits, and seven hundred thousand attendants to guard this talisman within the Jade Palace of the Great Tenuity. Those who wear this talisman shall wield authority over Heaven and Earth, rebuke the host of spirits, command radiant dragons, and hold office among the exalted immortals. Once its jade resonance is activated, jade blossoms shall attend at one’s side, golden perfected ones shall guard as soldiers, a thousand demons shall lose their courage, ten thousand ghosts shall vanish in form, the Nine Demons shall bow their heads, the Six Heavens shall crumble, the Dao’s wonders shall reach the ultimate truth, and the spirits shall gather the Five Numinous Powers. To the left, the Dark Lad shall howl; to the right, the Golden Dawn shall be subdued. How great is this precious writ, the true majesty of the Supreme Emperor! It is not merely for dispelling poisons, repelling trials, and extinguishing demons—it is the mark of attaining the wondrous ranks of immortality and realizing the true Dao.\n\nTwenty-seven **Jade Maidens of the Script** shall attend and protect the body of the one who upholds the scriptures. Those who revere the talisman and honor the precepts shall ascend to the Three Clarities’ Palaces. Should one violate or profane it, or transmit it to the unworthy, their body shall enter the winds and fires, unredeemed for eternal kalpas.\n\nThe talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on white silk and worn upon the head. Additionally, a belt of orpiment and azure is tied at the right side of the waist. All is in accordance with the covenant and statutes of the Most High.\n\nAll talismans within this scroll are inscribed in cinnabar.\n\nThe **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance Golden Elixir True Talisman** holds inner invocations of awe-inspiring spirit, summoning divine soldiers to sever and extinguish wayward souls. One must enter the chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Whether sitting or lying, recite the invocation:\n\n*\"Expel the Qian Toxin King! Raise the fluttering banner of Luo! The Eight Immortals grasp their halberds! The Five Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor! The Supreme Mystery descends in radiance! The Seven Mornings guard the courtyard! The Yellow Perfected shines with talismanic brilliance! Flames and bells cast forth! Divine tigers brandish their might! Poisoned blades clash in chaos! The purple majesty of the script unfurls! The Four Quaking Ones roar to the heavens! The Four Heavens stand towering! Know the names of ghosts, and the outer realm shall tread in the mysterious qi! Guard within with the master’s soldiers! Left, wield awe; right, turn to survey! Wind strikes, fire conquers! Shout and sever ten thousand demons! Crush and behead a thousand spirits! The Golden Perfected rouses its might! The Nine Demons submit their forms! The Northern Feng crumbles and falls! All that is destroyed shall be overthrown!\"*\n\n*\"I wear the true talisman and command the ten thousand spirits. The Three Primes report to the true, the mysterious aligns with the Emperor’s sincerity. The Supreme Micro Emperor ascends to the Three Clarities.\"*\n\nThe method of the **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance’s** awe-inspiring inner invocation belongs to the esoteric scriptures of the **Highest Clarity**. The *\"Qian Toxin King\"* is the hidden name of the great demon within the Six Heavens. The *\"fluttering banner of Luo\"* is the concealed title of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor. The *\"towering Four Heavens\"* are the soul-names of the ghostly ministers of the Northern Feng. One who knows the names of these three ghosts shall cause a thousand demons to flee without trace, ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms, the Nine Demons to be powerless to test, and a hundred evils to be unable to inflict harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits of palaces and temples, one may proceed with confidence, without need to burn incense or enter the chamber. If fasting and entering the chamber, or at the morning and evening audiences of the Eight Primes, to subdue demons, summon spirits, and command divine perfected ones, one may wear the talisman and proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe **Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Talisman**\nThe **Lord of the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor** addressed the **Upper Minister Azure Youth** and the **Queen Mother of the Western Citadel**, saying: *\"The* **Highest Clarity Wisdom Scripture for Dispelling Demons** *is the jade tablet of the Supreme Ultimate, the true formula of the Most High. The* **Divine Tiger True Talisman** *is the treasured chapter of the Great Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens. Wisdom can dispel filth, dispelling demons can restrain evil, and the true talisman can subdue demons and extinguish demons. Those who possess jade tablets with purple names and cultivate the supreme method shall not be assailed by the myriad demons or tested by the ten thousand demons. This may be called: no harm can intrude upon the divine might of the Divine Tiger, the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now I entrust this to you, to transmit to later students who are destined to become true persons. Follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected Ones: within seven hundred years, permit three transmissions. Do not show it to the unworthy, nor carelessly reveal the true scripture, lest one incur the punishment of the wind-blade.\"*\n\n*\"Those who delight in the true Dao, diligently focus their minds on the mysterious, do not begrudge wealth, and value the method above material goods—such is the Dao that abides within. Only to such persons may this be spoken. Those who inwardly covet treasures and outwardly indulge in frivolous desires—the Dao, though already illuminated, shall be sealed within a jade coffer, locked with a golden gate. After ascending and attaining transcendence, it shall be concealed within a famous mountain.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe **Jade Capital of the Supreme Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Golden Clouds’ Awe-Inspiring Jade Invocation**, the **Supreme Prime Scripture of the Supreme Divine Tiger Talisman**.\n\nThe **large characters of the Divine Tiger** and the **invocation for wielding spirits** are stored by the Supreme Lord in the chamber of the **Primordial Beginning**, not transmitted to the world. Only those who are **supreme perfected ones** may behold them. According to the statutes of the **Supreme Ultimate’s esoteric methods**, on the day of ascension, one may transmit it to a single person; beyond that time, it may not be revealed again. The rites of transmission follow the preceding method.\n\nFurthermore, when transmitting the scripture, the disciple shall hand-copy one copy for the master. After one hundred days, the master shall cast it into the eastern flowing waters, ensuring no one sees. This scripture is called *\"Transcending the Human Dao\"* and is a solemn covenant with the Three Officials.\n\n---\n\n**Oral Formula and Invocation Method for the Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Great Talisman**\nWhen receiving the oral formula of the **Supreme Lord’s Jade Spirit Divine Tiger Great Talisman**, after completing the covenant and reception, the disciple shall cross their hands and draw a single line to present to the master. One hundred days after receiving the scripture, the master shall purify themselves for three days. The text drawn by the disciple, along with the covenant oaths and invocations, shall be sealed with an iron seal and cast into the deep waters of the Eastern Sea. Then, facing the heavens, recite the invocation:\n\n*\"Supreme true talisman, Jade Spirit Divine Tiger! The receiver’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, erasing punishments and trials. They shall surely attain perfection and disperse all sorrows and sufferings. Do not divulge this! Ten thousand ages pass in an instant. Solemnly covenant with the Water Official, swiftly swear to the Earth Deity.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, return directly without looking back. This is called *\"completing the covenant.\"* It is the beginning of having one’s name recorded in the register of the **Upper Official of the Three Officials**.\n\nIf, after receiving it, one does not act accordingly, they shall never be permitted to wear the **Divine Tiger Scripture** nor have their name inscribed in the **Highest Clarity**. After three years, their body shall perish, and they shall endure the long trials of the Water Official.\n\nAfter the solemn covenant, on the **wu-shen** day of the **fourth month of each season**, use cinnabar to draw the talisman on white silk, making it three feet and two inches in length. Write the characters *\"white king\"* (bai wang), strike the teeth seven times, and recite the invocation:\n\n*\"The spirit of the Supreme Divine Tiger gathers qi into the purple script, containing the radiance of jade essence. Its might subdues fierce demons, restrains the ten thousand spirits. Divine youths attend and guard, Jade Maidens support the form. I wear this scripture and command golden soldiers, becoming a king of immortals, flying and ascending to the Highest Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, strike the teeth seven more times and swallow saliva three times. On that day, use a **purple damask pouch** and a **white brocade pouch** to contain it and wear it on the body.\n\nAccording to the statutes of the **Four Poles**, this talisman is weighty and may not be exposed to the world of mortals. Only those who already possess an **immortal name and jade tablet** may hear and see it. On the day of receiving the talisman, always inscribe it in cinnabar on white silk, rolling it to a size of one’s choosing and placing it in the pouch. If it has not been soiled or defiled, it may be worn on the body. In all matters, maintain secrecy, do not mix it with other scriptures, nor reveal its title.\n\nBeware, for this is forbidden by the Great Ultimate—take heed! The primordial celestial talisman, the divine *qi*, the essence and radiance of the Most Supreme, coalesces into the **Seven-Headed Spirit Tiger of Vital *Qi***, ever attendant to guard the body, subdue and extinguish demonic forces, and dispel misfortune. The tiger’s retinue must never speak to others, saying, “I possess a celestial talisman,” nor disclose the title of this scripture. Should one speak to one person, one tiger departs; to two, two tigers leave; to three, three depart—until all seven tigers have gone, and the body is left without its guardian hosts. Then, malevolent spirits, demonic ghosts, the **Three Officials**, and the **Northern Emperor** will all come to test and assail. If one has not yet attained immortality, keep this deeply secret. By the statutes of the **Four Pacts**, take utmost care—take heed, take heed!\n\n**Sponsor, Supervisor, Preceptor, and the Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity**—Second Rank of the Jade Clarity Department.\n\nOn the day of [year], in the reign of [Tai Sui], the [month] and [day], [hour], [so-and-so] of [prefecture, commandery, county, village], male/female, named [personal name], aged [years], born on the [month, day, hour], now presents offerings and tokens to the **Master of the Three Caverns**, [so-and-so], to request and receive the *Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity*. I vow to uphold and cultivate it without敢轻泄 or exposing its true text. Should I once violate these statutes, I shall bear the consequences of divine judgment, unforgiven for ten thousand kalpas. If received and maintained according to the proper method, I shall attain immortality in both life and death—all in accordance with the covenant and its decrees.\n\nThe **Most High Lord of the Great Dao** states: The Void and Perpetuity are the *hun* and *po* of Heaven and Earth, the majestic brilliance of *yin* and *yang*. The Void is the essence and spirit of the Nine Heavens, while Perpetuity is the numinous soul of the Nine Earths. The two *qi* converge at the center of the Dipper, forming the great deity of the Supreme Emperor, whose radiance aids and illuminates the cosmos. They regard the assisting deities as their gaze, dispatching the celestial light to survey all directions, recording the constellations of Heaven, revolving the Five Constants, summoning and gathering transformations, hastening the mechanisms of the divine. When Heaven is at peace and Earth is prosperous, the Void and Perpetuity remain concealed; when Heaven is in turmoil and Earth is disturbed, they shine forth in clarity. Fortune and misfortune, omens and warnings—all are instantly reported. They transform the myriad *qi*, alter *yin* and *yang*, and govern the succession of the four seasons—none occurs without their agency. The two stars are most revered, hidden within the splendor of dawn. Those who behold them gain boundless longevity; those who cultivate their Way ascend to the Highest Clarity. Only those whose names are inscribed in the **Jade Register of the Mysterious Chart** may lawfully behold this text. Practitioners shall perform this ritual seven times a month. On the days of the **Six Ding** and the **Eight Festivals**, one may enter the chamber, burn incense, and arrange the diagram and mat to the left and right. Facing south, strike the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars entering the five palaces of the viscera, their light penetrating the entire body until warmth is felt. Next, meditate upon the **Royal Ladies of the Five Stars** and the **Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity**, recalling their names, taboo names, and attire according to their respective directions. When all is complete, recite the secret invocation:\n\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—governing the Four Origins,\nMysterious clarity flows and reflects, illuminating the Five Gates.\nWithin reside the Spirit Lords of the Five Stars and their Ladies,\nThe Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity, Most Exalted,\nTransforming their forms and radiance, uniting ten thousand divisions.\nDescend into the Five Viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals,\nRefining my seven *po*, nurturing my three *hun*,\nLifting my form to ascend, soaring into the Dipper’s Gate,\nRoaming the Upper Capital, the Five Stars in assembly.\nToday, I invoke this mysterious blessing—grant what I have recited.\"*\n\nAfterward, draw in the light of the Five Stars and swallow twenty-five times. Then take seven steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Venus**. Hold the breath for seven breaths, facing west, and recite:\n\n*\"The Seven Gates of the West, white *qi* flying in radiance,\nAbove dwells the Luminous Emperor of Lesser *Yin*, the August Brilliance,\nWhose taboo name is ‘Metal’s Supreme Essence,’\nClad in feathered robes, resplendent hues flowing,\nGlowing bright in the Golden Palace,\nCalled the Five Luminaries, the lineage of the Void and Perpetuity.\nBearing talismans and wielding staffs, they summon *yin* and command *yang*,\nTransforming water and fire across seventy-four directions.\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, concealing my radiance in the Void,\nRiding the white chariot, roaming the cloud chambers,\nTo enjoy eternal years, boundless and infinite.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow seven breaths while looking upward. Then take twelve steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Saturn**. Hold the breath for twelve breaths, facing southwest, and recite:\n\n*\"The Four *Qi* of the Central August, overseeing the Eight Numinous,\nWithin the Jade Terrace and Purple Chamber, divine luminaries transform and arise.\nThere dwells the Primordial August One, the Five Constants’ hidden name,\nWho daily treads the Gate of Perpetuity, pacifying the Yellow Court.\nClad in robes of flying clouds, crowned with the essence of splendor,\nHolding talismans and wielding staffs, adorned with fiery bells,\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, reveal my divine name,\nDescend into my spleen and viscera, pacify my spirit and essence,\nAscend to Heaven and enter the clouds, conceal my radiance and transform my form,\nHide and alter the myriad things, roam the Jade Clarity,\nTo dwell with the August Lord, together guarding the Great Brilliance.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow twelve breaths while looking upward. Then take three steps, stand upon the **Star of Mars**, face south, hold the breath for three breaths, and recite:\n\n*\"The Three Gates ablaze with radiance, cinnabar light flowing in essence,\nMysterious *qi* surging, glowing bright in the Southern Abyss.\nAbove dwells the Crimson August One, the luminous spirit of the Five Emperors,\nWhose taboo name is ‘Wandering Radiance,’\nClad in brocade and patterned essence,\nCrowned with a treasure diadem, girded with jade bells,\nMoving in and out of the Vermilion Palace, the Purple Chamber and Crimson Walls.\nRecord and protect my life, inscribe my birth in the Southern Palace,\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, transform my *qi* and conceal my form.\nOn auspicious days, practice the Way—may all under Heaven be purified.\nMy heart-spirit coalesces into truth, my five *hun* shine with clarity,\nAligned with the Three *Qi*, merging with the radiance of the Fire Star.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow three breaths while looking upward. Then take nine steps, stand upon the **Star of Jupiter**, face east, hold the breath for nine breaths, and recite:\n\n*\"The Nine *Qi* of the East, the Jade Gate of the Azure Heavens,\nWithin dwells the Azure Dawn, the Lord of the Mysterious Supreme,\nWhose flowing essence surges—this is the celestial *hun*.\nWhose taboo name is ‘Great Brightness,’ exalted above Heaven and Earth,\nClad in phoenix robes and striped tiger skirts,\nTransforming into Five Luminaries, shifting forms across the Nine Capitals.\nCrowned with the essence of azure, wearing the Jade Diadem of the Heavens,\nBearing golden talismans and feathered staffs, tinkling bells in abundance,\nHolding the Hidden Script, soaring in flight with feathered texts.\nRecord my life, guard my Liver Gate,\nExternally radiant, internally luminous—my liver stores the immortal.\nWelcome my ascent, to ascend and pay homage to the Imperial Dawn.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the starlight and swallow nine times to conclude.\n\nNext, take five steps onto the Wood Star, face north, hold the breath for five cycles, and recite:\n\n*\"The Five *Qi* of the North, the Mysterious Gate of the Profound,\nThe Northern Asterism flows in radiance, the Supreme Jade Clarity of the *Kui* Constellation,\nWithin dwells the Grand Sovereign, the Five Emperors’ exalted names,\nWhose taboo name is ‘Primal Yin Elixir,’\nClad in robes of darkest azure, crowned with the Jade Diadem,\nGirded with belts of tinkling bells,\nBearing golden talismans and jade staffs, jade pendants gleaming bright,\nWandering the resplendent dawn, gazing beside the Eight Obscurities,\nDescending in revolving streams to enter my Kidney Court,\nPreserving and recording the Five Spirits, my viscera flourishing in brilliance,\nInternally and externally replete, transforming my radiance and altering my form,\nMy bones take flight, my flesh ascends—\nI ascend to the Jade Clarity.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the starlight and swallow five times to conclude.\n\nAfter pacing the Five Stars, retreat seven steps from the Water Star, ascend to the Metal Star, stand with feet together, and recite the first of the Nine Constants:\n\n*\"Nine Constants, Earth Lords, transform the shadows of the hidden depths,\nConceal my steps for me, that I may escape my form.\"*\n\nUpon completion, ascend to the second, the Nurturing Constant, and

the North, subduing the Three Yangs of the South,\nGolden talismans command the spirits, the Supreme Emperor lends his aid,\nThe Six *Wu* escape the Six *Ji*, preserving passage through the Cavern

Gate,\nThat my viscera may swiftly transform into immortality,\nSoaring through the Constants into the void, traversing water and fire across the myriad origins,\nWherever my will directs, ascending

reciting:\n\n*\"Imperial Measure of the Upper Palace, the Lady of the Left August,\nFacing the Imperial Lord, aligning radiance and uniting with the true,\nNamed the Void Constant, transforming the Nine Heavens,\nGuiding and conducting the sun and moon, gathering qi to form mist,\nRevolving water and fire, myriad transformations within the body,\nAt this moment, the primal auspice unfolds,\nGrant that I pace in flight, ever riding and entering the true,\nThe Nine Celestial Bodies flowing and descending, enjoying blessings by the myriad thousands,\nMy form equaling heaven and earth, my lifespan matching the divine tree.\"*\n\nUpon completion, raise the head and swallow the twenty-four qi, then cease.\n\nNext, ascend above the Star of Assistance and stand facing the Earthly Gate.\n\nThe Star of Assistance resides within the third star of the Dipper, at the Dipper’s mouth, serving as the abode of the Perfected One of Assistance and the star of Hidden Primordiality. When pacing the nine steps of the Dipper, one must avoid the Perfected One’s star and never tread upon it—always crossing from the second star to the fourth. In this Void Constant method, however, one does not pace the Perfected One’s star but only the stars of Assistance and Support. After completing the steps of the Star of Assistance, return to the Star of Support, pace it while reciting the invocation, and the circuit of the Void Constant Dao will be complete. The invocation reads:\n\n*\"Supreme Venerable of the Upper Palace, the Lady of the Right August,\nIn union with the Imperial Lord, merging with the radiant Flower Chamber,\nHeavenly soul and earthly spirit, named the Supreme Void,\nTransforming the nine qi, ancestral origin of the myriad Perfected,\nRevolving metal and turning stone, equaling heaven in merit,\nDissolving mountains and rivers, commanding clouds and dragons,\nMyriad marvels respond instantly, dividing light into countless streams,\nPacing in flight through the void, radiance flowing and surging,\nConcealing the body within the Dipper’s seat, cloaked in celestial light,\nEver transcending heaven and earth, enjoying boundless blessings,\nMay all wishes be fulfilled, and lifespan know no end.\"*\n\nUpon completion, knock the teeth and swallow qi thirty-six times, and the Void Constant Dao is complete. Practicing this for seven years will allow one to divide the form into nine voids; after fourteen years, one may soar through the Great Void. Careful and precise visualization is essential, as detailed in the scripture. Write the characters in cinnabar on white silk, store them in a brocade pouch, and wear it on the head during pacing. When ascending the stars, one must also visualize and invoke these three characters.\n\n**Method for Pacing the Stars in Sequence**\nFacing the Bright Yang of the Great Dipper, proceed forward. When the right foot treads upon the Celestial Pass, advance the left foot to join it, regulate the breath, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—\nthe five phases propel one another,\nthe seven stars gleam resplendent,\nthe celestial net wields supreme might.\nThe Star of Assistance governs flourishing,\nthe Star of Support repels decline.\nThe Nine Perfected and Supreme Ones,\nthe Great Ultimate and Radiant Tenuity,\nthe Three Palaces and Jade Emperors,\nthe Three Venerables ward off calamity.\nHeaven turns, earth revolves,\nsoul and spirit follow in unison.\nGrant that I ascend as a flying immortal,\ntrue light lingering and circling,\nmy name inscribed in the Golden Chamber,\nthe Jade Pass now open.\nRiding the dragon to ascend the void,\nsun and moon shine together,\nroaming the Upper Clarity,\njingling bells and emerald robes,\nseizing lightning on the left,\ncommanding thunder on the right.\nAll earthly evils,\nprostrate and dead, dare not pursue.\nIf wicked intent turns toward me,\nmay it be severed and crushed.\nBy imperial decree, Jade Maidens\nattend and escort me home.\nSoul, spirit, and body united,\nascend and soar as one.\"*\n\n**Method for Retrograde Pacing**\nStand at the Celestial Pass, face the North Pole, hold the breath and clench the fists. When the right foot treads upon the Yin Essence, the left foot steps before the Bright Yang, then the right foot joins the left. Turn right toward the Celestial Pivot and softly recite:\n\n*\"The Celestial Dipper’s true yang,\nthe Dipper’s motion rises and falls.\nAdvancing, the primordial mechanism turns;\nretreating, the numinous net stirs.\nSubdue the spirit to bring tranquility,\nrestrain the soul to ensure well-being.\nSoul, spirit, and body\ntogether ascend to the celestial halls.\nFacing the Golden Gate,\nthe Supreme August One on high,\nthe Immortal Mother on the left,\nthe Immortal Lord on the right,\npurple and emerald flying blossoms,\ndragon robes and tiger garments,\nadorned with the true sash and jade,\na halo crowning the head,\nholding divine bells in hand,\ngolden pendants at the waist,\nchanting the *Dongzhen* scriptures,\nthe sevenfold wondrous verses.\nFirst born from emptiness and nothingness,\nthen becoming an immortal king,\nsoaring through the nine paths,\ngrasping the Dipper and climbing the net.\nAdvancing with the Great One,\nretreating with the Mysterious Lord,\nreceiving the oral transmission,\nsitting in death and standing in oblivion.\nThe essential retrograde method\nelevates one to the rank of immortal minister.\nThe five viscera regenerate,\nwelcoming one another of their own accord.\nAll wishes are fulfilled,\nall pursuits prosper.\nMyriad evils and countless harms\nhide away in distant lands.\"*\n\n**Method for Reverse Pacing**\nAgain hold the breath, circle three times outside the Dipper’s stars, beginning at the Bright Yang to pace the soul. Turn right at the Bright Yang, step with the left foot onto the Celestial Pivot, then join with the right foot. Hold the breath and clench the fists, step with the left foot onto the Jade Light, the right foot onto the Gate of Yang, then both feet proceed in reverse to the Bright Yang. Turn the body to face the Mysterious Darkness, place the right hand over the heart, and point with the left hand toward the Mysterious Darkness. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth twenty-one times, and swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Recite:\n\n*\"Intestine Brightness and purple qi,\nthe Primordial Simplicity and mysterious stars,\nthe Golden Pass and Yellow Chamber—\nwithin dwells the Great Spirit,\nleft hand supporting the Supreme August One,\nright hand grasping the Lofty Perfected,\ndragon mouth holding emerald robes,\nflying brocade with tiger patterns,\njade talismans at the waist,\nlotus crown upon the head.\nEmerging from nothingness, entering the void,\ngolden perfection and jade radiance,\nthe numinous and venerable one,\nnamed Intestine Brightness,\nfeet treading crimson mist,\nmouth chanting the *Dongzhang* scriptures.\nBestowing upon me the hidden texts,\nteaching the pacing of the celestial net,\ncircling thrice in repetition,\ngrasping the Dipper and forgetting breath.\nGrant that I ascend as a flying immortal,\nsoaring through the void,\nmy name inscribed in the Upper Clarity,\nriding the dark dragon’s chariot.\nWhatever the mind knows,\nwhatever the heart desires,\nall shall be fulfilled.\nThe Three Venerables unite in virtue,\nsoul and spirit commune within,\narriving at the divine palace,\nJade Maidens and Jade Lads attend.\"*\n\n**Method for Grasping the Dipper’s Handle**\nStep with both feet onto the Yin Essence star, place the left hand over the heart, and point with the right hand toward the Perfected One’s star. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Softly recite:\n\n*\"Yin Essence, mysterious and plain,\nthe Flowery Gate within the radiant palace—\nwithin dwells the Jade Emperor,\nthe North Pole’s Supreme Venerable,\nphoenix-embroidered collar,\ndragon-emerald skirt,\ntiger bells at the waist,\nred mushroom crown upon the head,\nnamed Yin Essence,\nthe Supreme One’s Lord.\nBestowing upon me the hidden texts,\nteaching the pacing of the seven origins,\ngrasping the Dipper’s handle to ascend,\nroaming the numinous passes.\nExternally restraining the seven spirits,\ninternally governing the three souls.\nRefining the spirit to shed worldly burdens,\ntreasuring the soul as the womb’s spirit.\nSoul and spirit guard the body,\nascending as immortals together.\nSoaring through the Upper Clarity,\nreturning qi to rejuvenate the countenance.\nAll intentions fulfilled,\nten thousand desires without difficulty.\"*\n\n**Method for Receiving the Perfected**\nStep with both feet onto the Star of Support, the left foot first, without following its celestial net. Turn the body to face the Perfected One’s star, visualize and bow. Kneel with knees flanking the Star of Support, hands over the heart. Hold the breath for four breaths, knock the teeth four times, and swallow saliva four times. Recite the incantation: *\"Though the feet stand on the right Support, the visualized incantation resides at the Perfected One’s star.\"*\n\nThe Nine Stars of the Great Ultimate,\nSupreme Clarity’s luminous perfected ones,\nhold the balance of the true mechanism,\nexhaling and inhaling purple mist.\nGolden radiance and jade brilliance\ncast majestic light across the ten heavens,\ncommanding and guiding the Three Luminaries,\nharmonizing yang and regulating yin.\nThey govern the primordial and bestow qi,\nrenewing the old with transformative governance.\nAbove, they rule the Central Constellations;\nprofound is the mystery of the Mysterious Pass.\nGolden chambers and jade portals,\nthe northern gate’s fourfold convenience—\nemerging to ride the Eight Effulgences,\nfloating through the Celestial Origin.\nDragon-brocade and phoenix robes,\ntiger-jade skirts in flight,\ncrimson essence and emerald sashes,\npurple plumes with sevenfold edges.\nAt the waist, divine talismans girdle;\non the head, a lotus crown rests.\nAbove, they perch in the Nine Voids;\nbelow, they soar through the Eight Abysses.\nSelf-styled as the Jade Sovereign,\nthe Supreme Perfected of the Nine Heavens,\nthey pity my devotion to the Dao,\nbestowing upon me the Hidden Scriptures.\nI personally ascend the Star of Support,\npaying homage to the Numinous Lord,\nentreating the cinnabar writ\nto precede my birth.\nThus I govern the Three Heavens,\nsoaring through the Eight Mysteries.\nThe five viscera regenerate spontaneously,\nascending as a flying immortal of the highest rank.\nI become the Jade Emperor’s winged attendant,\na minister to the sages yet to come,\nmy rank exalted as Grand Master.\nRiding clouds and flying chariots,\nall wishes are fulfilled,\nand no malevolent forces may intrude.\n\n**Method for Treading the Dipper**\n\nBoth feet ascend together to the Star of Dark Mystery. Standing upon the Star of Support, the right hand rests upon the heart while the left hand points to the Star of Cinnabar Origin. Hold the breath for three cycles, strike the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Visualize the Star of Dark Mystery beneath the feet, then recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Divine radiance of the Grotto-Heaven,\nConcealed within Dark Mystery’s return,\nQi fills the Great Void,\nComing and going without form.\nHidden in heaven, buried in earth,\nPermeating all without birth—\nSuddenly ascending the Celestial Net,\nStepping upward to the Purple Court,\nGazing north to the Cloud Chambers,\nTurning south toward the Thunder Citadel.\nDazzled by ten thousand transformations,\nNo longer the former shape.\nIn fleeting visions of streaming light,\nTouching it, it instantly takes form.\nShould it come seeking to conceal itself,\nKnow my name:\nFrom emptiness, deliverance from peril,\nNinefold mystery of the Perfected.\nSitting or rising with the Six Jia,\nAudience granted by the Six Ding.\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,\nTo tread the Dipper and traverse the stars.\nLooking up, I behold the Supreme Sovereign,\nClad in crimson and azure,\nHolding the numinous radiance in hand,\nJade bells girded at the waist.\nAbove, I entreat flight as an immortal,\nBorn together with heaven.\nMy name inscribed in the Supreme Subtlety,\nFloating through the Highest Clarity.\nBelow, I entreat transformation,\nConcealing my luminous form in the register.\nAll affairs as I wish,\nAll obstacles leveled.\"*\n\n**Method for Treading the Constellation’s Path**\nBoth feet ascend together to the Star of Cinnabar Origin, the left foot first, then the right foot joining. The left hand rests upon the heart while the right hand points to the North Star. Hold the breath for three cycles, strike the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. Then recite the prayer:\n\n*\"Supreme Nine Terraces,\nCinnabar Origin’s mysterious path,\nExternally governing the North Star,\nInternally rectifying Heaven’s principle.\nGolden towers gleam without,\nJade courts radiate within.\nAt their center dwells the Most Honored,\nNamed the Crimson Child,\nWho rules within the Cinnabar Origin,\nIn the crimson chamber.\nEmbroidered clouds of jade,\nDragon mantle and tiger robe.\nIn the right hand, the Jade Register;\nIn the left, the Dipper’s guiding cord.\nFeet tread upon luminous clouds,\nHead crowned in purple.\nTo the right, flowing bells;\nTo the left, jade pendants.\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,\nTo tread the path and wander the stars.\nAbove, I entreat flight as an immortal,\nRiding the dark dragon’s chariot.\nMy name inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace,\nThe Jade Hall of the Supreme Ultimate.\nWherever I turn, wherever I seek,\nFortune and prosperity come to meet me.\"*\n\n**End.**\n**Method for Treading the Celestial Net**\n\n**Method for Treading the Celestial Net (Continued)**\n\nBoth feet ascend together to the North Star. The left foot leads, the right follows. With the right hand resting upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva thrice. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Mystery of the Great Tenuity,\nPurple Canopy of the North Star,\nBeneath lies the Great Perfected,\nSoaring boundlessly beyond.\nJade skirts in flight,\nGolden bells and azure sashes,\nA girdle of radiant jade,\nMystic numina in misty array—\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,\nThat I may ascend the Seven Qi,\nMount the clear and distant mists,\nMeet with the Perfected,\nAnd entreat flight as an immortal.\nInscribe my name in the Cinnabar Chamber.\nWherever I turn, wherever I seek,\nNo calamity, no harm shall befall me.\"*\n\n**End.**\n\n**Method for Mounting the Dragon**\nBoth feet ascend together to the Celestial Pivot Star. The left leads, the right follows, moving along the Net’s outer path. With the right hand resting upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva thrice. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme North Star,\nPurple Tenuity beyond the stars,\nPrecious Mystery of the Golden Chamber,\nWithout lies the Jade Gate.\nRevolving through the Nine Palaces,\nHarmonizing the Celestial Pivot—\nWithin dwells the Honored Divinity,\nNamed the Purple Sovereign.\nGrant me the Hidden Scriptures,\nThat I may ride the dragon,\nAscend the Nine Heavens,\nDescend to the Earth’s Origin.\nA chariot of luminous clouds,\nA robe of dark splendor and jade hues,\nA dragon-whip at the waist,\nA tiger-patterned headscarf.\nEmbracing the myriad beings,\nInstructing the flying immortals—\nRelease me from the name of death,\nThat I may endure with heaven and earth.\nMounting the dragon, treading the Dipper,\nWherever I turn, grace shall attend me.\"*\n\n**End.**\n\nStill holding the breath, visualize the dragon-chariot with its crimson canopy descending from heaven to welcome you. In a trance of ascent, forget the body for a long while, then turn to ascend the Auxiliary Star. Roam the Three Realms. Both feet ascend together to the Auxiliary Star, turning left. The left foot leads, following the Net around the North Star to tread upon the Auxiliary Star, the right foot joining after. Face the North Star, both hands resting upon the heart. Hold the breath for one cycle, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva once. Lift the head to gaze upon the star and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Ultimate’s Auxiliary Star,\nEssence dwelling in the Purple Pass,\nNurturing life, fostering destiny,\nPrecious guardian of spirit and soul.\nThe Golden Chamber opens again,\nThat I may behold the Auxiliary Star.\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,\nThat I may wander and revolve.\nInscribe my name among the Sage Emperors,\nA flying immortal of the Nine Heavens.\nA radiant headscarf, a girdle of truth,\nEntering and exiting the Grotto Gate.\"*\n\n**End.**\n\nWithin the Auxiliary Star, bow to the Dao Lord. In a trance, forget the body for a long while, then turn to ascend the Aligning Star. Wander the Three Yangs, then proceed to the Aligning Star. Both feet ascend together, the left foot leading, passing directly by each star until floating above the Aligning Star in the void. The right foot joins. Face the Perfected Star, both hands resting upon the heart. Hold the breath for one cycle, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva once. Recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great Void’s Mud-Pill Palace,\nPurple Palace’s Heavenly Honored,\nMystic Void’s True Pivot,\nForemost of the Emperor—\nIn the Dao, the Jade Sovereign;\nIn the body, the Mud-Pill.\nSwift as a sudden inspiration,\nQi pierces the Three Origins.\nEssence enters the Hall of Light,\nStrengthening the womb, enriching the soul.\nThe Crimson Mountain opens again,\nThat I may behold the Numinous Origin.\nGather the sun’s splendor on the left,\nPluck the moon’s root on the right.\nFlaming fire streams ten thousand leagues,\nA golden net and azure skirt.\nA tiger-tally at the waist,\nA flowered crown upon the head.\nBestow upon me the Hidden Scriptures,\nThat I may traverse the Celestial Pivot.\nEntreat flight as an immortal,\nCommanding the myriad spirits.\nWherever I turn, all shall converge,\nVirtue and fortune like mountains.\"*\n\n**End.**\n\nAbide within the Aligning Star in the heavens, bowing to the Jade Sovereign and entreating swift ascent as a flying immortal.\n\n**On the Day of Audience with the Pole**\nIf it coincides with the day of audience with the Pole, descend to pay homage to the Dipper. In descending, turn left. The right foot ascends to the Celestial Pivot, then proceed leftward to tread the Three Terraces and Five Stars.\n\n**Days of Audience with the Pole**\nFor treading the Net and stepping the Path, always use these days, including the first day of each *jiazi* cycle and the Eight Nodal Days:\n- Spring: First day of the first month, twentieth day of the second month, twenty-seventh day of the third month.\n- Summer: Eighth day of the fourth month, fifth day of the fifth month, eighteenth day of the sixth month.\n- Autumn: Seventh day of the seventh month, twentieth day of the eighth month, ninth day of the ninth month.\n- Winter: Fifth day of the tenth month, third day of the eleventh month, sixth day of the twelfth month.\n\nFor all practices of flying steps, treading the Net, and traversing the stars, use these days, following the preceding methods.\n\nAfter fourteen years of practice, the essence of the Seven Stars descends and transforms into divine beings, all riding the Flowing Bells and Eight Radiant Cinnabar-Speckled Clouds to attend you. They bow to you as an immortal official, and you ascend in broad daylight upon a flying dragon.\n- In one year, you avert misfortune and calamity.\n- In two years, you avert warfare.\n- In three years, you avert death.\n- In four years, you become an Earth Immortal. A thousand harms and ten thousand evils—none dare encroach.\nFrom this point onward, blessings and fortune shall be boundless, summoning divine spirits to harness and ride the flying dragon. The Supreme Ultimate bestows the magic mushroom; the Jade Emperor provides attendants.\n\nAfter twenty-eight years of practice, you become a Perfected of the Highest Clarity. Thus preserved and exalted.\n\n**Supervisor of Transmission, Transmission Master, and the Supreme Two Radiant Three Flying Registers**\n*Third Rank of the Jade Clarity Department*\n\nOn the day of [disciple’s name], styled [Daoist name], in the year of [Tai Sui year], the [month] and [day], born in [prefecture], [commandery], [county], [village], [male/female], [personal name], aged [years], born on the [month], [day], and [hour], now presents offerings and tokens of faith to the Three Caverns Master, [Master’s name], to receive the *Supreme Two Radiant Three Flying Registers*.\n\nFollow the divine canon of the Flying Radiance, adhering to its precepts and disciplines. Practice diligently from dawn to dusk, and do not transmit this to the unworthy. Should one grow negligent or careless, or lightly disclose its secrets, the recipient shall bear karmic retribution in the unseen realms. All is bound by the oath of the Four Poles and the true statutes of the covenant.\n\nFor those cultivating the Way of the Three Radiant Ones, first purify through a hundred-day retreat—or fifty days at minimum—severing all worldly affairs before entering seclusion. After completing the retreat, maintain purity throughout the year, not merely during the seclusion period. If, during practice, prolonged interruptions occur, perform another fifty-day retreat before resuming. For minor lapses, a five-day retreat suffices.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Sun**\nAt midday, the Crimson Qi of the Supreme August True Lord, whose taboo name is *Jiangche Liang* and style *Gaoqianshuang*, presides. Though the scripture does not record specific methods for venerating this exalted and secret office, it states that those who know shall not die. At the outset of practice, hold this knowledge in the heart, but do not invoke the name lightly. The method for the moon follows the same principle.\n\n**Names and Titles of the Five Thearchs:**\n- **Azure Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in azure-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring azure blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Dawn Lotus of Kingfisher Plumes*.\n- **Vermilion Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in crimson-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring cinnabar blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Vermilion Hollow Brilliance*.\n- **White Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in white-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring white blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Luminous Jade Lotus of Purity*.\n- **Black Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in black-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring black blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Mystic Mountain Lotus*.\n- **Yellow Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in yellow-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring yellow blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Purple Lotus of Divine Radiance*.\n\nMemorize the forms and vestments of the Five Thearchs. During practice, visualize each Thearch’s crown and attire as described. Each morning, face the rising sun and bow twice. First, don proper robes, prepare the incense burner, rinse the mouth, and hold the scripture’s characters upon the tongue, their heads turned inward. Sit upright and wait for the sun’s full radiance to appear. Kneel, offer incense, and silently invoke the taboo name and style of the Supreme August Lord, pressing both hands to the heart in reverence. After bowing, close the eyes, hold the breath for ten cycles, sit squarely facing the sun, clasp the thumbs into fists, tilt the face toward the sun, and hold for ten breaths. Then, swallow the sunlight ten times, imagining its rays entering the mouth and being ingested. Visualize the sun’s crimson qi, its purple rays with nine beams, and silently intone: *\"Nine Spirits of Luminous Brilliance, Nine Rays of Flowering Radiance, descend and infuse my face.\"* Slightly part the lips, gently inhale, and swallow ten times. Hold the breath and envision the radiance within the abdomen, ascending to the *Mud Pill* and descending to the viscera, illuminating the body inside and out. Sustain this vision until the practice concludes, ensuring the light does not dissipate.\n\nAfterward, softly intone—only loud enough for your own ears to hear:\n*\"Within the sun dwells the Azure Thearch, Round and Eternal, styled Dragon Veil.\"*\n\nFirst, visualize the Five Thearchs seated within the sun, arrayed according to the five directions. Focus on the Azure Thearch, silently invoking his name, and he shall respond. Proceed likewise for the other Thearchs.\n- **Vermilion Thearch:** *Danling Zhi*, styled *Verdant Crimson Glow*.\n- **White Thearch:** *Haoyu Jiang*, styled *Returning Golden Mist*.\n- **Black Thearch:** *Chengcao Chun*, styled *Mystic Verdant Flame*.\n- **Yellow Thearch:** *Shouyi Fu*, styled *Whirlwind Radiance*.\n\nNext, invoke:\n*\"First, visualize the Moon Spirit as a round orb, golden in hue, slightly smaller than the sun, nestled within the sun’s qi. Do not fixate on its form; simply sense its divine presence responding within.\"*\n*\"Moon Spirit, Essence of Radiance, Warm and Serene Terrace.\"*\n\nThen, silently recite:\n*\"May I, with the Five Thearchs and the Moon Spirit, together ride the radiant clouds and ascend to the Sun Palace.\"*\n\nClose the eyes and visualize:\n- The Azure Thearch emerging from the sunlight to stand at your left,\n- The Vermilion Thearch at your right,\n- The White Thearch behind you,\n- The Black Thearch above your left hand,\n- The Yellow Thearch above your right hand.\n\nSilently invoke each Thearch’s taboo name and style, summoning all five. Visualize their vestments and colors vividly. Once all are present, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:\n*\"Crimson Crucible, Cinnabar Radiance, Round Flower of Nine Brilliances,\nGreat Splendor awakens the spirit, blazing with vermilion essence.\nFive Thearchs initiate the dawn, illuminating the myriad lives.\nGaze upon the Perfected of the Highest Clarity—emptiness and harmony prevail.\nCirculate the qi, refine the elixir, coursing through the five forms.\nMay my spirit transform, my six palaces flourish and fill.\nRide the crimson clouds, ascend the Nine Chariots of Yang,\nSoaring to the Sun Palace to merge with the Thearch’s spirit.\"*\n\nNext, visualize the crimson cloud chariot of *Yang Sui*, drawn by nine vermilion dragons, arriving from the sunlight before you. Board it with the Five Thearchs and ascend to the sun.\n\nAfter one year of practice, you shall perceive their likenesses; after two, their forms shall appear; after three, they shall descend; after four, your visage shall gleam with jade-like radiance, and you shall attain luminous clarity. In five years, you shall achieve Perfection. In eleven years, you shall ride a cloud chariot with a feathered canopy, drawn by a host of dragons, ascending to the Sun Palace to receive the scriptures and be named an *Upper Clarity Perfected*. You shall be attended by twenty-six jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Moon**\n\n**Method for Flying to the Moon**\n\nIn fasting seclusion, visualize as in the solar method. Within the moon’s yellow *qi* resides the Divine Mother of the Supreme Thearch, whose taboo name is *Yaodao You* and whose style is *Yuhui Tiao*. The Lady of the Azure Thearch appears as an infant, clad in a shimmering azure-jade brocade mantle and a skirt of soaring phoenixes woven in kingfisher plumes. Her hair is bound in a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, the rest cascading to her waist—all the Ladies share this coiffure.\n\nThe Lady of the Vermilion Thearch wears a cinnabar-jade brocade mantle and a crimson phoenix-embroidered skirt of flying feathers. The Lady of the White Thearch dons a white-jade brocade mantle with four-dragon motifs and a plain-feathered skirt adorned with simurgh patterns. The Lady of the Black Thearch is robed in a black-jade brocade mantle with nine-cloud designs and a black-feathered skirt of dragon motifs. The Lady of the Yellow Thearch wears a yellow-cloud mountain-patterned brocade mantle and a green-feathered skirt embroidered with phoenixes.\n\nThe forms and attire of these Five Ladies must be memorized beforehand. In cultivation, visualize their appearances as in the solar method. Each evening, face the rising moon and bow twice in its direction. On the second or third day after the new moon, when the moon first appears as the sun sets, begin the practice. As the moon ascends, wait until the sunlight fully fades and the moonlight grows bright before proceeding. During the dark of the moon, when its form is absent, no visualization is possible.\n\nIf the moon is not visible indoors, go to the courtyard or beneath the eaves; in rain, remain inside. First, don your cap and robes, prepare an incense burner, rinse your mouth, and place the scripture’s text upon your tongue, its characters facing inward. Offer incense to the moon, kneel lengthwise, and visualize the style of the Divine Mother of the Supreme Thearch. Press your hands to your heart and bow. After bowing, close your eyes, hold your breath for nine cycles, and sit upright facing the moon, hands resting on your knees. Hold the scripture in your right hand, clench your left fist, and tilt your face toward the moon. After nine breaths, swallow the moonlight nine times. Visualize the moonlight entering your mouth, then imagine the moon’s yellow *qi* and white radiance, its eight dark rays. Silently invoke: *\"Lunar essence, night’s essence—eight rays descend upon my face.\"* Slightly part your lips, gently inhale, and swallow nine times. Then, holding your breath, envision the radiance within your abdomen ascending to the *Niwan* and descending to the viscera, illuminating your form and penetrating within and without. Sustain this brilliance until the practice concludes, allowing no dissipation. When finished, softly exhale so that only your ears perceive the sound.\n\nThe Lady of the Azure Thearch is named *Eyin Zhu*, styled *Fenyan Ying*. First, visualize the Five Thearch Ladies seated within the moon according to the five directions, forming a circular image. Focus your mind on the Lady of the Azure Thearch and call her, then visualize her responding. The other Ladies follow likewise.\n\nThe Lady of the Vermilion Thearch is named *Yiyi Liao*, styled *Wanyan Xu*. The Lady of the White Thearch is named *Lingsu Lan*, styled *Yulian Hua*. The Lady of the Black Thearch is named *Jielian Qiao*, styled *Chunshu Jin*. The Lady of the Yellow Thearch is named *Qingying Jin*, styled *Jionding Rong*.\n\nNext, invoke: First visualize the solar essence as a vermilion, apotropaic square within the moon’s *qi*, equal in size to the moon. Do not fixate on its form—simply sense its numinous presence responding. *\"Solar essence, spirit—vermilion youth of pearlescent radiance.\"*\n\nConclude with a silent prayer: *\"May I, without uttering a sound, ascend with the Five Thearch Ladies and the solar essence-spirit, riding flying clouds to the Lunar Palace.\"*\n\nClose your eyes and visualize the Lady of the Azure Thearch descending from the moonlight to your left, the Lady of the Vermilion Thearch to your right, the Lady of the White Thearch behind you, the Lady of the Black Thearch at your left hand, and the Lady of the Yellow Thearch at your right hand. Each holds a text in her hands, facing you. Silently call their taboo names and styles, summoning the Five Thearch Ladies, and visualize their attire and colors distinctly. Then, envision all five Ladies in their respective positions simultaneously. Strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Yellow essence unfurls its splendor,\nPrimal Yin’s inner chapter,\nMirroring the Great Mystery,\nOpening the myriad realms.\nScattering the misty cold winds,\nSeven dawns of dark jade,\nRevolving Yin’s triple convergence,\nHeaven and Earth exhale light.\nCloud mantles of dense silk,\nJade pendants and girdle ornaments,\nSilken veils of refined cloth,\nNurturing the Wood Thearch.\nPurple radiance emerges,\nFloating blossoms in nine voids,\nCircular brightness bestows hues,\nSix *qi* transform and flow.\nFive Thearch Ladies,\nTreading clouds, grasping winds,\nFeathered skirts brushing the heavens,\nWafting through the eastern void,\nSoaring trees unfurling dawn,\nCanopies of refined Peng,\nRoots spanning ten thousand leagues,\nShading the five bodies.\nSoul harmonized, spirit transformed,\nSix mysteries fill the clouds.\nReturning from age to infancy,\nJade infants revert to youth.\nTimely riding the sinking mist,\nTen dragons draw flying clouds,\nAscending to the Lunar Palace,\nEntrusted with safeguarding weight.\"*\n\nConclude. Visualize the solar essence riding the moonlight before your face, nine inches away, sensing its numinous presence within. Then, envision a chariot of flowing bells and flying clouds, drawn by ten yellow dragons, arriving from the moonlight before you. Board it with the Five Ladies and ascend to the moon.\n\nAfter one year of practice, you shall perceive their semblances; after two, their forms shall appear; after three, they shall descend; after four, you shall attain luminous clarity, your body emanating flowing light. In five years, you shall achieve Perfection. In eleven years, you shall ride a chariot of dark reins and radiant splendor, ascending to the Lunar Palace to be named an *Upper Clarity Perfected*. You shall be attended by twenty-six jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Stars**\nWood governs spring...\n\nFire governs summer; Metal, autumn; Water, winter. All follow the calendar: the onset of their reign begins at midnight preceding each of the four *li* days, each lasting seventy-two days. Earth governs the eighteen days preceding each solstice and equinox, its reign commencing at midnight before these *fen* and *zhi* days.\n\nWhen the stars are visible, you may go to the courtyard, sitting or standing as you please, to observe the five stars converging. At the appointed time for practice, go to the courtyard—sitting is preferable to standing. On the altar in the courtyard, face the star, spread a mat, arrange the ritual table, burn incense, and bow in reverence. Then sit upright to proceed. If the stars are not visible on cloudy nights, you may perform the practice within your chamber by visualization.\n\nThe stars need not be in their cardinal directions; practice facing wherever they appear. For instance, Wood may be in the west. Each night, absorb the essence of all five stars, ensuring completeness, but prioritize the star governing the current month. If you are a secluded Daoist in retreat, you may also perform this within your chamber, visualizing the true script of the five stars and practicing toward them. If unversed in astrological calculations and unaware of the stars’ positions, or if you maintain long-term seclusion and fasting, you may always practice within your chamber, facing the cardinal directions of the five stars’ original positions.\n\nWhen swallowing the radiance of the stars, visualize the Supreme Sovereign and the Lady of the Supreme Sovereign riding within the star’s light, entering your mouth as you swallow. With eyes closed, faintly perceive their forms.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Wood Star**\nThe Wood Star is the round mirror of Wood’s essence, the darkly radiant Eastern Yang’s terrace. Within the star are nine gates, each emitting nine rays of light, each ray stretching nine million *zhang*. Within each gate resides a Green Emperor. Visualize the star as vast and perfectly round, ninety *li* in diameter, evenly surrounded by nine gates. The Emperor wears the attire of the Green Emperor and is titled the Duke of Azure Numinosity.\n\nRegularly observe the Jupiter star. Burn incense, focus your mind, and gaze at the star, calling: *\"Green Emperor Sovereign.\"* Then visualize the Azure Terrace Sovereign and his Lady within the star. Place your right hand over your heart and bow. Hold your breath, click your teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close your eyes, and silently invoke: *\"Jupiter Star Perfected Sovereign, personal name Chenglan, style Qingning; Lady, personal name Baorong, style Feiyun. May I be granted to ascend with the Primordial Yang Green Sovereign and his Lady, together riding the Eight Radiant Azure Chariot to the Supreme Palace.\"*\n\nAfterward, lower your hands slightly before your closed eyes to glimpse the star’s radiance, and recite the incantation: *\"Heavenly light harmonizes, essence flows in the east. Gazing up at the nine gates, flying auroras scatter their rays. On the Primordial Yang Azure Terrace, within lies the azure and yellow. Azure fangs hang in splendor, illuminating the nine directions. The Lady of Yuji, styled Feiyun, wears spirit brocade, dragon mantle and tiger skirt, girded with phoenix talismans, her head crowned with a floral coronet. Emerging from non-being, entering the void, she roams the Great Non-being. Preceded by the Green Emperor, followed by a thousand spirits, they come to welcome and receive, enabling flight as a Perfected. Ascending to Jade Clarity, to the chambers of the Most High.\"*\n\nFinish, then remove your hands, close your eyes, face the star, and absorb its radiance. Visualize the nine rays entering your throat. First, visualize the True Sovereign and Lady, swallowing them into your liver. Then absorb twenty-seven breaths, completing the ingestion, and click your teeth three more times.\n\nAfter fourteen years of consistent practice, the Green Sovereign of the Great Lord within Jupiter will memorialize the Most High Jade Clarity Palace, inscribing your name on the Jade Tablet of the Grand Tenuity. Your name shall be recorded in jade script, and you shall be titled an *Upper Clarity Upper Flying Perfected*.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Fire Star**\nThe Fire Star is the dark mirror of Fire’s essence, reflecting the Southern Pavilion. Within the star are three gates, each emitting three rays of light, each ray stretching three million *zhang*. Within each gate resides a Red Emperor. Visualize the star as vast and perfectly round, thirty *li* in diameter, evenly surrounded by three gates. The Emperor wears red attire. At the center dwell the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Yang Red Sovereign of the Supreme Perfected and his Lady.\n\nRegularly observe the Mars star. Burn incense, focus your mind, and gaze at the star. Visualize the star’s vast roundness, its gates, rays, and the Red Emperor, silently calling: *\"Red Emperor Sovereign.\"* Then visualize the Vermilion Cloud Crimson City Sovereign and his Lady within the star. Place your left hand over your heart and bow, cover your mouth with your right hand, hold your breath three times, click your teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close your eyes, and silently invoke: *\"Mars Star Perfected Sovereign, personal name Weiting, style Sanyong; Lady, personal name Huaping, style Xuanluo. May I be granted to ascend with the Cinnabar Heaven Red Sovereign and his Lady, together riding the Eight Radiant Vermilion Chariot to the Jade Clarity Palace.\"*\n\nAfterward, face the star and recite the incantation: *\"Mysterious image flows and reflects, cinnabar light in the southern darkness. Gazing up at the three gates, the Vermilion Cloud Crimson City. Within dwells the Cinnabar Sovereign, named Weiting. The Lady shines within, known as Huaping. Together they wear cloud frost, phoenix splendor and dragon bells, girded with tiger script, their heads crowned with flying azure.

Let the star’s three rays enter your throat. First, visualize the True Sovereign and Lady, swallowing them into your heart. Then absorb twenty-seven breaths, completing the ingestion, and click your teeth three more times.\n\nAfter fourteen years of consistent practice, the Red Sovereign of the Supreme Perfected within Mars will memorialize the Three Origins Mysterious Supreme Palace, inscribing your name on the Jade Tablet of the Mysterious Chart. Your name shall be recorded in gold script, and you shall be titled an *Upper Clarity Upper Flying Perfected*.\n\nThe Dao of Ascending the Golden Star to Fly:\nThe Star Chart of Venus mirrors the Golden Essence, radiant and luminous in the western sky. Within Venus are seven gates, each emitting seven rays of light, each ray stretching seven million *li* in length. Within each gate resides a White Sovereign. Visualize the star as vast and perfectly round, spanning seventy *li* in diameter, its circumference evenly marked by seven gates. The Sovereigns wear white robes, and within the star dwell the White Sovereign of the Grand Simplicity and Lesser Yin, the Dao Lord, and his Lady.\n\nRegularly observe Venus: burn incense, compose your mind, and gaze upon the gates and the White Sovereigns within. Silently invoke: *\"White Sovereign Lord.\"* Then visualize the Jade Chamber within the star, where the White Sovereign Lord and his Lady reside. Place your hand over your heart in reverence, cover both nostrils with your left hand, hold your breath seven times, click your teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close your eyes, and silently invoke: *\"Star Lord of Venus, personal name Liaoling, style Zhenxun; Lady, personal name Biaoying, style Ling’en.

I gaze upward at the seven gates, where numinous thresholds gleam with sharp brilliance. Pale radiance shines forth, virtue marking the Golden Lineage. Within dwells the Lesser Yin, styled the White Sovereign. His Lady, Ling’en, governs the Jade Chamber. Together they don white brocade, flowing bells and tiger talismans adorning their robes.

Then absorb twenty-seven breaths, completing the ingestion, and click your teeth three more times.\n\nAfter fourteen years of consistent practice, the White True Sovereign of the Lesser Yin within Venus will memorialize the Jade Emperor’s Palace of the Grand Supreme, inscribing your name upon the Golden Pavilion of the Upper Clarity. Your name shall be recorded on the Jade Tablet, and you shall be titled *Left True Duke of the Upper Clarity*, charged with overseeing the Supreme Ultimate.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of Ascending the Water Star to Fly:\nThe Star Chart of Mercury mirrors the Water Essence, profoundly reflecting the northern darkness. Within Mercury are five gates, each emitting five rays of light, each ray stretching five million *li* in length. Within each gate resides a Black Sovereign. Visualize the star as vast and perfectly round, spanning fifty *li* in diameter, its circumference evenly marked by five gates.

At that time, forty million billion **Jade Lads** and ninety million billion **Jade Maidens** spread yellow gold upon the earth and fashioned a couch of white jade. The **Heavenly Worthy** descended, with a mat of yellow gold, while all the **Perfected Immortals and Divine Kings** knelt in reverence and inquired of the **Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens**:\n\nWe have heard that the **Supreme Lords and Sages**, the **Great Emperor’s Mysterious Hymn**, the **Jade Emperor’s Radiant Splendor**, the **Cinnabar Blossoms and Verdant Kingfishers**, the **Phoenix-riding and Dragon-drawn chariots**, come to welcome the **August Thearch of Eastern Florescence**, joining in the chanting of the **Nine Shao Harmonious Spirit-Chants**.

      "translated_text": "The **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance Golden Elixir True Talisman** holds inner invocations of awe-inspiring spirit, summoning divine soldiers to sever and extinguish wayward souls. One must enter the chamber, burn incense, and strike the teeth thirty-six times. Whether sitting or lying, recite the invocation:\n\n*\"Expel the Qian Toxin King! Raise the fluttering banner of Luo! The Eight Immortals grasp their halberds! The Five Numinous Ones of the Supreme Emperor! The Supreme Mystery descends in radiance! The Seven Mornings guard the courtyard! The Yellow Perfected shines with talismanic brilliance! Flames and bells cast forth! Divine tigers brandish their might! Poisoned blades clash in chaos! The purple majesty of the script unfurls! The Four Quaking Ones roar to the heavens! The Four Heavens stand towering! Know the names of ghosts, and the outer realm shall tread in the mysterious qi! Guard within with the master’s soldiers! Left, wield awe; right, turn to survey! Wind strikes, fire conquers! Shout and sever ten thousand demons! Crush and behead a thousand spirits! The Golden Perfected rouses its might! The Nine Demons submit their forms! The Northern Feng crumbles and falls! All that is destroyed shall be overthrown!\"*\n\n*\"I wear the true talisman and command the ten thousand spirits. The Three Primes report to the true, the mysterious aligns with the Emperor’s sincerity. The Supreme Micro Emperor ascends to the Three Clarities.\"*\n\nThe method of the **Supreme Prime Upper Radiance’s** awe-inspiring inner invocation belongs to the esoteric scriptures of the **Highest Clarity**. The *\"Qian Toxin King\"* is the hidden name of the great demon within the Six Heavens. The *\"fluttering banner of Luo\"* is the concealed title of the Demon King of the Northern Emperor. The *\"towering Four Heavens\"* are the soul-names of the ghostly ministers of the Northern Feng. One who knows the names of these three ghosts shall cause a thousand demons to flee without trace, ten thousand ghosts to conceal their forms, the Nine Demons to be powerless to test, and a hundred evils to be unable to inflict harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or amidst the spirits of palaces and temples, one may proceed with confidence, without need to burn incense or enter the chamber. If fasting and entering the chamber, or at the morning and evening audiences of the Eight Primes, to subdue demons, summon spirits, and command divine perfected ones, one may wear the talisman and proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe **Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Talisman**\nThe **Lord of the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor** addressed the **Upper Minister Azure Youth** and the **Queen Mother of the Western Citadel**, saying: *\"The* **Highest Clarity Wisdom Scripture for Dispelling Demons** *is the jade tablet of the Supreme Ultimate, the true formula of the Most High. The* **Divine Tiger True Talisman** *is the treasured chapter of the Great Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens. Wisdom can dispel filth, dispelling demons can restrain evil, and the true talisman can subdue demons and extinguish demons. Those who possess jade tablets with purple names and cultivate the supreme method shall not be assailed by the myriad demons or tested by the ten thousand demons. This may be called: no harm can intrude upon the divine might of the Divine Tiger, the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now I entrust this to you, to transmit to later students who are destined to become true persons. Follow the statutes of the Supreme Perfected Ones: within seven hundred years, permit three transmissions. Do not show it to the unworthy, nor carelessly reveal the true scripture, lest one incur the punishment of the wind-blade.\"*\n\n*\"Those who delight in the true Dao, diligently focus their minds on the mysterious, do not begrudge wealth, and value the method above material goods—such is the Dao that abides within. Only to such persons may this be spoken. Those who inwardly covet treasures and outwardly indulge in frivolous desires—the Dao, though already illuminated, shall be sealed within a jade coffer, locked with a golden gate. After ascending and attaining transcendence, it shall be concealed within a famous mountain.\"*\n\n---\n\nThe **Jade Capital of the Supreme Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Golden Clouds’ Awe-Inspiring Jade Invocation**, the **Supreme Prime Scripture of the Supreme Divine Tiger Talisman**.\n\nThe **large characters of the Divine Tiger** and the **invocation for wielding spirits** are stored by the Supreme Lord in the chamber of the **Primordial Beginning**, not transmitted to the world. Only those who are **supreme perfected ones** may behold them. According to the statutes of the **Supreme Ultimate’s esoteric methods**, on the day of ascension, one may transmit it to a single person; beyond that time, it may not be revealed again. The rites of transmission follow the preceding method.\n\nFurthermore, when transmitting the scripture, the disciple shall hand-copy one copy for the master. After one hundred days, the master shall cast it into the eastern flowing waters, ensuring no one sees. This scripture is called *\"Transcending the Human Dao\"* and is a solemn covenant with the Three Officials.\n\n---\n\n**Oral Formula and Invocation Method for the Supreme Lord’s Divine Tiger Great Talisman**\nWhen receiving the oral formula of the **Supreme Lord’s Jade Spirit Divine Tiger Great Talisman**, after completing the covenant and reception, the disciple shall cross their hands and draw a single line to present to the master. One hundred days after receiving the scripture, the master shall purify themselves for three days. The text drawn by the disciple, along with the covenant oaths and invocations, shall be sealed with an iron seal and cast into the deep waters of the Eastern Sea. Then, facing the heavens, recite the invocation:\n\n*\"Supreme true talisman, Jade Spirit Divine Tiger! The receiver’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, erasing punishments and trials. They shall surely attain perfection and disperse all sorrows and sufferings. Do not divulge this! Ten thousand ages pass in an instant. Solemnly covenant with the Water Official, swiftly swear to the Earth Deity.\"*\n\nAfter the invocation, return directly without looking back. This is called *\"completing the covenant.\"* It is the beginning of having one’s name recorded in the register of the **Upper Official of the Three Officials**.\n\nIf, after receiving it, one does not act accordingly, they shall never be permitted to wear the **Divine Tiger Scripture** nor have their name inscribed in the **Highest Clarity**. After three years, their body shall perish, and they shall endure the long trials of the Water Official.\n\nAfter the solemn covenant, on the **wu-shen** day of the **fourth month of each season**, use cinnabar to draw the talisman on white silk, making it three feet and two inches in length. Write the characters *\"white king\"* (bai wang), strike the teeth seven times, and recite the invocation:\n\n*\"The spirit of the Supreme Divine Tiger gathers qi into the purple script, containing the radiance of jade essence. Its might subdues fierce demons, restrains the ten thousand spirits. Divine youths attend and guard, Jade Maidens support the form. I wear this scripture and command golden soldiers, becoming a king of immortals, flying and ascending to the Highest Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, strike the teeth seven more times and swallow saliva three times. On that day, use a **purple damask pouch** and a **white brocade pouch** to contain it and wear it on the body.\n\nAccording to the statutes of the **Four Poles**, this talisman is weighty and may not be exposed to the world of mortals. Only those who already possess an **immortal name and jade tablet** may hear and see it. On the day of receiving the talisman, always inscribe it in cinnabar on white silk, rolling it to a size of one’s choosing and placing it in the pouch. If it has not been soiled or defiled, it may be worn on the body. In all matters, maintain secrecy, do not mix it with other scriptures, nor reveal its title.",

      "translated_text": "Beware, for this is forbidden by the Great Ultimate—take heed! The primordial celestial talisman, the divine *qi*, the essence and radiance of the Most Supreme, coalesces into the **Seven-Headed Spirit Tiger of Vital *Qi***, ever attendant to guard the body, subdue and extinguish demonic forces, and dispel misfortune. The tiger’s retinue must never speak to others, saying, “I possess a celestial talisman,” nor disclose the title of this scripture. Should one speak to one person, one tiger departs; to two, two tigers leave; to three, three depart—until all seven tigers have gone, and the body is left without its guardian hosts. Then, malevolent spirits, demonic ghosts, the **Three Officials**, and the **Northern Emperor** will all come to test and assail. If one has not yet attained immortality, keep this deeply secret. By the statutes of the **Four Pacts**, take utmost care—take heed, take heed!\n\n**Sponsor, Supervisor, Preceptor, and the Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity**—Second Rank of the Jade Clarity Department.\n\nOn the day of [year], in the reign of [Tai Sui], the [month] and [day], [hour], [so-and-so] of [prefecture, commandery, county, village], male/female, named [personal name], aged [years], born on the [month, day, hour], now presents offerings and tokens to the **Master of the Three Caverns**, [so-and-so], to request and receive the *Register of Soaring Steps in the Void of Perpetuity*. I vow to uphold and cultivate it without敢轻泄 or exposing its true text. Should I once violate these statutes, I shall bear the consequences of divine judgment, unforgiven for ten thousand kalpas. If received and maintained according to the proper method, I shall attain immortality in both life and death—all in accordance with the covenant and its decrees.\n\nThe **Most High Lord of the Great Dao** states: The Void and Perpetuity are the *hun* and *po* of Heaven and Earth, the majestic brilliance of *yin* and *yang*. The Void is the essence and spirit of the Nine Heavens, while Perpetuity is the numinous soul of the Nine Earths. The two *qi* converge at the center of the Dipper, forming the great deity of the Supreme Emperor, whose radiance aids and illuminates the cosmos. They regard the assisting deities as their gaze, dispatching the celestial light to survey all directions, recording the constellations of Heaven, revolving the Five Constants, summoning and gathering transformations, hastening the mechanisms of the divine. When Heaven is at peace and Earth is prosperous, the Void and Perpetuity remain concealed; when Heaven is in turmoil and Earth is disturbed, they shine forth in clarity. Fortune and misfortune, omens and warnings—all are instantly reported. They transform the myriad *qi*, alter *yin* and *yang*, and govern the succession of the four seasons—none occurs without their agency. The two stars are most revered, hidden within the splendor of dawn. Those who behold them gain boundless longevity; those who cultivate their Way ascend to the Highest Clarity. Only those whose names are inscribed in the **Jade Register of the Mysterious Chart** may lawfully behold this text. Practitioners shall perform this ritual seven times a month. On the days of the **Six Ding** and the **Eight Festivals**, one may enter the chamber, burn incense, and arrange the diagram and mat to the left and right. Facing south, strike the teeth twenty-four times, close the eyes, and visualize the Five Stars entering the five palaces of the viscera, their light penetrating the entire body until warmth is felt. Next, meditate upon the **Royal Ladies of the Five Stars** and the **Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity**, recalling their names, taboo names, and attire according to their respective directions. When all is complete, recite the secret invocation:\n\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—governing the Four Origins,\nMysterious clarity flows and reflects, illuminating the Five Gates.\nWithin reside the Spirit Lords of the Five Stars and their Ladies,\nThe Twenty-Five Luminaries of the Void and Perpetuity, Most Exalted,\nTransforming their forms and radiance, uniting ten thousand divisions.\nDescend into the Five Viscera, coalescing into Jade Immortals,\nRefining my seven *po*, nurturing my three *hun*,\nLifting my form to ascend, soaring into the Dipper’s Gate,\nRoaming the Upper Capital, the Five Stars in assembly.\nToday, I invoke this mysterious blessing—grant what I have recited.\"*\n\nAfterward, draw in the light of the Five Stars and swallow twenty-five times. Then take seven steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Venus**. Hold the breath for seven breaths, facing west, and recite:\n\n*\"The Seven Gates of the West, white *qi* flying in radiance,\nAbove dwells the Luminous Emperor of Lesser *Yin*, the August Brilliance,\nWhose taboo name is ‘Metal’s Supreme Essence,’\nClad in feathered robes, resplendent hues flowing,\nGlowing bright in the Golden Palace,\nCalled the Five Luminaries, the lineage of the Void and Perpetuity.\nBearing talismans and wielding staffs, they summon *yin* and command *yang*,\nTransforming water and fire across seventy-four directions.\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, concealing my radiance in the Void,\nRiding the white chariot, roaming the cloud chambers,\nTo enjoy eternal years, boundless and infinite.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow seven breaths while looking upward. Then take twelve steps, bring the feet together, and stand upon the **Star of Saturn**. Hold the breath for twelve breaths, facing southwest, and recite:\n\n*\"The Four *Qi* of the Central August, overseeing the Eight Numinous,\nWithin the Jade Terrace and Purple Chamber, divine luminaries transform and arise.\nThere dwells the Primordial August One, the Five Constants’ hidden name,\nWho daily treads the Gate of Perpetuity, pacifying the Yellow Court.\nClad in robes of flying clouds, crowned with the essence of splendor,\nHolding talismans and wielding staffs, adorned with fiery bells,\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, reveal my divine name,\nDescend into my spleen and viscera, pacify my spirit and essence,\nAscend to Heaven and enter the clouds, conceal my radiance and transform my form,\nHide and alter the myriad things, roam the Jade Clarity,\nTo dwell with the August Lord, together guarding the Great Brilliance.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow twelve breaths while looking upward. Then take three steps, stand upon the **Star of Mars**, face south, hold the breath for three breaths, and recite:\n\n*\"The Three Gates ablaze with radiance, cinnabar light flowing in essence,\nMysterious *qi* surging, glowing bright in the Southern Abyss.\nAbove dwells the Crimson August One, the luminous spirit of the Five Emperors,\nWhose taboo name is ‘Wandering Radiance,’\nClad in brocade and patterned essence,\nCrowned with a treasure diadem, girded with jade bells,\nMoving in and out of the Vermilion Palace, the Purple Chamber and Crimson Walls.\nRecord and protect my life, inscribe my birth in the Southern Palace,\nGrant me the power to soar in flight, transform my *qi* and conceal my form.\nOn auspicious days, practice the Way—may all under Heaven be purified.\nMy heart-spirit coalesces into truth, my five *hun* shine with clarity,\nAligned with the Three *Qi*, merging with the radiance of the Fire Star.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, swallow three breaths while looking upward. Then take nine steps, stand upon the **Star of Jupiter**, face east, hold the breath for nine breaths, and recite:\n\n*\"The Nine *Qi* of the East, the Jade Gate of the Azure Heavens,\nWithin dwells the Azure Dawn, the Lord of the Mysterious Supreme,\nWhose flowing essence surges—this is the celestial *hun*.\nWhose taboo name is ‘Great Brightness,’ exalted above Heaven and Earth,\nClad in phoenix robes and striped tiger skirts,\nTransforming into Five Luminaries, shifting forms across the Nine Capitals.\nCrowned with the essence of azure, wearing the Jade Diadem of the Heavens,\nBearing golden talismans and feathered staffs, tinkling bells in abundance,\nHolding the Hidden Script, soaring in flight with feathered texts.\nRecord my life, guard my Liver Gate,\nExternally radiant, internally luminous—my liver stores the immortal.\nWelcome my ascent, to ascend and pay homage to the Imperial Dawn.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Star of Assistance resides within the third star of the Dipper, at the Dipper’s mouth, serving as the abode of the Perfected One of Assistance and the star of Hidden Primordiality. When pacing the nine steps of the Dipper, one must avoid the Perfected One’s star and never tread upon it—always crossing from the second star to the fourth. In this Void Constant method, however, one does not pace the Perfected One’s star but only the stars of Assistance and Support. After completing the steps of the Star of Assistance, return to the Star of Support, pace it while reciting the invocation, and the circuit of the Void Constant Dao will be complete. The invocation reads:\n\n*\"Supreme Venerable of the Upper Palace, the Lady of the Right August,\nIn union with the Imperial Lord, merging with the radiant Flower Chamber,\nHeavenly soul and earthly spirit, named the Supreme Void,\nTransforming the nine qi, ancestral origin of the myriad Perfected,\nRevolving metal and turning stone, equaling heaven in merit,\nDissolving mountains and rivers, commanding clouds and dragons,\nMyriad marvels respond instantly, dividing light into countless streams,\nPacing in flight through the void, radiance flowing and surging,\nConcealing the body within the Dipper’s seat, cloaked in celestial light,\nEver transcending heaven and earth, enjoying boundless blessings,\nMay all wishes be fulfilled, and lifespan know no end.\"*\n\nUpon completion, knock the teeth and swallow qi thirty-six times, and the Void Constant Dao is complete. Practicing this for seven years will allow one to divide the form into nine voids; after fourteen years, one may soar through the Great Void. Careful and precise visualization is essential, as detailed in the scripture. Write the characters in cinnabar on white silk, store them in a brocade pouch, and wear it on the head during pacing. When ascending the stars, one must also visualize and invoke these three characters.\n\n**Method for Pacing the Stars in Sequence**\nFacing the Bright Yang of the Great Dipper, proceed forward. When the right foot treads upon the Celestial Pass, advance the left foot to join it, regulate the breath, and softly recite:\n\n*\"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—\nthe five phases propel one another,\nthe seven stars gleam resplendent,\nthe celestial net wields supreme might.\nThe Star of Assistance governs flourishing,\nthe Star of Support repels decline.\nThe Nine Perfected and Supreme Ones,\nthe Great Ultimate and Radiant Tenuity,\nthe Three Palaces and Jade Emperors,\nthe Three Venerables ward off calamity.\nHeaven turns, earth revolves,\nsoul and spirit follow in unison.\nGrant that I ascend as a flying immortal,\ntrue light lingering and circling,\nmy name inscribed in the Golden Chamber,\nthe Jade Pass now open.\nRiding the dragon to ascend the void,\nsun and moon shine together,\nroaming the Upper Clarity,\njingling bells and emerald robes,\nseizing lightning on the left,\ncommanding thunder on the right.\nAll earthly evils,\nprostrate and dead, dare not pursue.\nIf wicked intent turns toward me,\nmay it be severed and crushed.\nBy imperial decree, Jade Maidens\nattend and escort me home.\nSoul, spirit, and body united,\nascend and soar as one.\"*\n\n**Method for Retrograde Pacing**\nStand at the Celestial Pass, face the North Pole, hold the breath and clench the fists. When the right foot treads upon the Yin Essence, the left foot steps before the Bright Yang, then the right foot joins the left. Turn right toward the Celestial Pivot and softly recite:\n\n*\"The Celestial Dipper’s true yang,\nthe Dipper’s motion rises and falls.\nAdvancing, the primordial mechanism turns;\nretreating, the numinous net stirs.\nSubdue the spirit to bring tranquility,\nrestrain the soul to ensure well-being.\nSoul, spirit, and body\ntogether ascend to the celestial halls.\nFacing the Golden Gate,\nthe Supreme August One on high,\nthe Immortal Mother on the left,\nthe Immortal Lord on the right,\npurple and emerald flying blossoms,\ndragon robes and tiger garments,\nadorned with the true sash and jade,\na halo crowning the head,\nholding divine bells in hand,\ngolden pendants at the waist,\nchanting the *Dongzhen* scriptures,\nthe sevenfold wondrous verses.\nFirst born from emptiness and nothingness,\nthen becoming an immortal king,\nsoaring through the nine paths,\ngrasping the Dipper and climbing the net.\nAdvancing with the Great One,\nretreating with the Mysterious Lord,\nreceiving the oral transmission,\nsitting in death and standing in oblivion.\nThe essential retrograde method\nelevates one to the rank of immortal minister.\nThe five viscera regenerate,\nwelcoming one another of their own accord.\nAll wishes are fulfilled,\nall pursuits prosper.\nMyriad evils and countless harms\nhide away in distant lands.\"*\n\n**Method for Reverse Pacing**\nAgain hold the breath, circle three times outside the Dipper’s stars, beginning at the Bright Yang to pace the soul. Turn right at the Bright Yang, step with the left foot onto the Celestial Pivot, then join with the right foot. Hold the breath and clench the fists, step with the left foot onto the Jade Light, the right foot onto the Gate of Yang, then both feet proceed in reverse to the Bright Yang. Turn the body to face the Mysterious Darkness, place the right hand over the heart, and point with the left hand toward the Mysterious Darkness. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the teeth twenty-one times, and swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Recite:\n\n*\"Intestine Brightness and purple qi,\nthe Primordial Simplicity and mysterious stars,\nthe Golden Pass and Yellow Chamber—\nwithin dwells the Great Spirit,\nleft hand supporting the Supreme August One,\nright hand grasping the Lofty Perfected,\ndragon mouth holding emerald robes,\nflying brocade with tiger patterns,\njade talismans at the waist,\nlotus crown upon the head.\nEmerging from nothingness, entering the void,\ngolden perfection and jade radiance,\nthe numinous and venerable one,\nnamed Intestine Brightness,\nfeet treading crimson mist,\nmouth chanting the *Dongzhang* scriptures.\nBestowing upon me the hidden texts,\nteaching the pacing of the celestial net,\ncircling thrice in repetition,\ngrasping the Dipper and forgetting breath.\nGrant that I ascend as a flying immortal,\nsoaring through the void,\nmy name inscribed in the Upper Clarity,\nriding the dark dragon’s chariot.\nWhatever the mind knows,\nwhatever the heart desires,\nall shall be fulfilled.\nThe Three Venerables unite in virtue,\nsoul and spirit commune within,\narriving at the divine palace,\nJade Maidens and Jade Lads attend.\"*\n\n**Method for Grasping the Dipper’s Handle**\nStep with both feet onto the Yin Essence star, place the left hand over the heart, and point with the right hand toward the Perfected One’s star.

Softly recite:\n\n*\"Yin Essence, mysterious and plain,\nthe Flowery Gate within the radiant palace—\nwithin dwells the Jade Emperor,\nthe North Pole’s Supreme Venerable,\nphoenix-embroidered collar,\ndragon-emerald skirt,\ntiger bells at the waist,\nred mushroom crown upon the head,\nnamed Yin Essence,\nthe Supreme One’s Lord.\nBestowing upon me the hidden texts,\nteaching the pacing of the seven origins,\ngrasping the Dipper’s handle to ascend,\nroaming the numinous passes.\nExternally restraining the seven spirits,\ninternally governing the three souls.\nRefining the spirit to shed worldly burdens,\ntreasuring the soul as the womb’s spirit.\nSoul and spirit guard the body,\nascending as immortals together.\nSoaring through the Upper Clarity,\nreturning qi to rejuvenate the countenance.\nAll intentions fulfilled,\nten thousand desires without difficulty.\"*\n\n**Method for Receiving the Perfected**\nStep with both feet onto the Star of Support, the left foot first, without following its celestial net. Turn the body to face the Perfected One’s star, visualize and bow. Kneel with knees flanking the Star of Support, hands over the heart. Hold the breath for four breaths, knock the teeth four times, and swallow saliva four times.

Practice diligently from dawn to dusk, and do not transmit this to the unworthy. Should one grow negligent or careless, or lightly disclose its secrets, the recipient shall bear karmic retribution in the unseen realms. All is bound by the oath of the Four Poles and the true statutes of the covenant.\n\nFor those cultivating the Way of the Three Radiant Ones, first purify through a hundred-day retreat—or fifty days at minimum—severing all worldly affairs before entering seclusion. After completing the retreat, maintain purity throughout the year, not merely during the seclusion period. If, during practice, prolonged interruptions occur, perform another fifty-day retreat before resuming. For minor lapses, a five-day retreat suffices.\n\n**Method for Flying to the Sun**\nAt midday, the Crimson Qi of the Supreme August True Lord, whose taboo name is *Jiangche Liang* and style *Gaoqianshuang*, presides. Though the scripture does not record specific methods for venerating this exalted and secret office, it states that those who know shall not die. At the outset of practice, hold this knowledge in the heart, but do not invoke the name lightly. The method for the moon follows the same principle.\n\n**Names and Titles of the Five Thearchs:**\n- **Azure Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in azure-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring azure blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Dawn Lotus of Kingfisher Plumes*.\n- **Vermilion Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in crimson-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring cinnabar blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Vermilion Hollow Brilliance*.\n- **White Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in white-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring white blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Luminous Jade Lotus of Purity*.\n- **Black Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in black-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring black blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Mystic Mountain Lotus*.\n- **Yellow Thearch:** Form like an infant, clad in yellow-jade brocade robes, a skirt of soaring yellow blossoms and feathered wings, crowned with the *Purple Lotus of Divine Radiance*.\n\nMemorize the forms and vestments of the Five Thearchs. During practice, visualize each Thearch’s crown and attire as described. Each morning, face the rising sun and bow twice. First, don proper robes, prepare the incense burner, rinse the mouth, and hold the scripture’s characters upon the tongue, their heads turned inward. Sit upright and wait for the sun’s full radiance to appear. Kneel, offer incense, and silently invoke the taboo name and style of the Supreme August Lord, pressing both hands to the heart in reverence. After bowing, close the eyes, hold the breath for ten cycles, sit squarely facing the sun, clasp the thumbs into fists, tilt the face toward the sun, and hold for ten breaths. Then, swallow the sunlight ten times, imagining its rays entering the mouth and being ingested. Visualize the sun’s crimson qi, its purple rays with nine beams, and silently intone: *\"Nine Spirits of Luminous Brilliance, Nine Rays of Flowering Radiance, descend and infuse my face.\"* Slightly part the lips, gently inhale, and swallow ten times. Hold the breath and envision the radiance within the abdomen, ascending to the *Mud Pill* and descending to the viscera, illuminating the body inside and out. Sustain this vision until the practice concludes, ensuring the light does not dissipate.\n\nAfterward, softly intone—only loud enough for your own ears to hear:\n*\"Within the sun dwells the Azure Thearch, Round and Eternal, styled Dragon Veil.\"*\n\nFirst, visualize the Five Thearchs seated within the sun, arrayed according to the five directions. Focus on the Azure Thearch, silently invoking his name, and he shall respond. Proceed likewise for the other Thearchs.\n- **Vermilion Thearch:** *Danling Zhi*, styled *Verdant Crimson Glow*.\n- **White Thearch:** *Haoyu Jiang*, styled *Returning Golden Mist*.\n- **Black Thearch:** *Chengcao Chun*, styled *Mystic Verdant Flame*.\n- **Yellow Thearch:** *Shouyi Fu*, styled *Whirlwind Radiance*.\n\nNext, invoke:\n*\"First, visualize the Moon Spirit as a round orb, golden in hue, slightly smaller than the sun, nestled within the sun’s qi. Do not fixate on its form; simply sense its divine presence responding within.\"*\n*\"Moon Spirit, Essence of Radiance, Warm and Serene Terrace.\"*\n\nThen, silently recite:\n*\"May I, with the Five Thearchs and the Moon Spirit, together ride the radiant clouds and ascend to the Sun Palace.\"*\n\nClose the eyes and visualize:\n- The Azure Thearch emerging from the sunlight to stand at your left,\n- The Vermilion Thearch at your right,\n- The White Thearch behind you,\n- The Black Thearch above your left hand,\n- The Yellow Thearch above your right hand.\n\nSilently invoke each Thearch’s taboo name and style, summoning all five. Visualize their vestments and colors vividly. Once all are present, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly intone:\n*\"Crimson Crucible, Cinnabar Radiance, Round Flower of Nine Brilliances,\nGreat Splendor awakens the spirit, blazing with vermilion essence.\nFive Thearchs initiate the dawn, illuminating the myriad lives.\nGaze upon the Perfected of the Highest Clarity—emptiness and harmony prevail.\nCirculate the qi, refine the elixir, coursing through the five forms.\nMay my spirit transform, my six palaces flourish and fill.\nRide the crimson clouds, ascend the Nine Chariots of Yang,\nSoaring to the Sun Palace to merge with the Thearch’s spirit.\"*\n\nNext, visualize the crimson cloud chariot of *Yang Sui*, drawn by nine vermilion dragons, arriving from the sunlight before you. Board it with the Five Thearchs and ascend to the sun.\n\nAfter one year of practice, you shall perceive their likenesses; after two, their forms shall appear; after three, they shall descend; after four, your visage shall gleam with jade-like radiance, and you shall attain luminous clarity. In five years, you shall achieve Perfection. In eleven years, you shall ride a cloud chariot with a feathered canopy, drawn by a host of dragons, ascending to the Sun Palace to receive the scriptures and be named an *Upper Clarity Perfected*.

The Lady of the Azure Thearch appears as an infant, clad in a shimmering azure-jade brocade mantle and a skirt of soaring phoenixes woven in kingfisher plumes. Her hair is bound in a three-cornered cloud-toppled chignon, the rest cascading to her waist—all the Ladies share this coiffure.\n\nThe Lady of the Vermilion Thearch wears a cinnabar-jade brocade mantle and a crimson phoenix-embroidered skirt of flying feathers. The Lady of the White Thearch dons a white-jade brocade mantle with four-dragon motifs and a plain-feathered skirt adorned with simurgh patterns. The Lady of the Black Thearch is robed in a black-jade brocade mantle with nine-cloud designs and a black-feathered skirt of dragon motifs. The Lady of the Yellow Thearch wears a yellow-cloud mountain-patterned brocade mantle and a green-feathered skirt embroidered with phoenixes.\n\nThe forms and attire of these Five Ladies must be memorized beforehand. In cultivation, visualize their appearances as in the solar method. Each evening, face the rising moon and bow twice in its direction. On the second or third day after the new moon, when the moon first appears as the sun sets, begin the practice. As the moon ascends, wait until the sunlight fully fades and the moonlight grows bright before proceeding. During the dark of the moon, when its form is absent, no visualization is possible.\n\nIf the moon is not visible indoors, go to the courtyard or beneath the eaves; in rain, remain inside. First, don your cap and robes, prepare an incense burner, rinse your mouth, and place the scripture’s text upon your tongue, its characters facing inward.
