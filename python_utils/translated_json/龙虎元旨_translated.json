  "full_translation": "**The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger**\n\n**Title:** *The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger* (Lónghǔ Yuánzhǐ).\n**Transmitted by:** Tang Master Dong Shi (董師元), compiled by Cheng Jun (成君).\n**One scroll.** Source of the original text: *The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Dynasty* (Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng), **Too Xuan Department** (太玄部).\n\n---\n\n**The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger**\n\nThe *Dragon and Tiger* refer to *lead and mercury* (yín gǒng). Mercury is the Dragon, lead is the Tiger.\nThe mother conceals the child within her womb; the child hides within the mother’s embrace.\nKnow the white while guarding the black; divine clarity will naturally arise.\n\nThe white is the essence of gold (*jīn*), the black is the foundation of water (*shuǐ*).\nThe method of using lead is subtle and profound—this is what is meant.\n\nThat which cannot be recognized must be known; merely rely on Heaven’s nature, and it will be encountered naturally.\n\nNow, take Heaven’s *qi* (arcanum), add Earth’s *qi* (arcanum), and combine the essences of the Sun and Moon to form the Dao of yin and yang.\nMercury is the Azure Dragon, its trigrammatic master is *Zhèn* (☳, Thunder), its hidden master is the liver, and it governs the east with *jiǎ yǐ* (甲乙, Wood).\nWood can generate fire; its original form is azure, but when it meets fire, it becomes vermilion—thus, it transforms into *cinnabar* (dānshā).\nIt becomes the Vermilion Bird, its trigrammatic master is *Lí* (☲, Flame), its hidden master is the heart, and it governs the south with *bǐng dīng* (丙丁, Fire).\nLí is yang; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—thus, cinnabar generates mercury within it.\nThe two strokes in Lí represent the golden rooster (yīng).\nThe golden rooster within the Sun is also yin.\n\nLead is the Dark Turtle, its trigrammatic master is *Kàn* (☵, Abyss), its hidden master is the kidney, and it governs the north with *rén guǐ* (壬癸, Water).\nKàn is yin; when yin reaches its peak, yang arises—thus, lead contains white gold within it.\nThe one stroke in Kàn represents the silver hare (yù).\nThe silver hare within the Moon is also yang.\n\nGold is the White Tiger, its trigrammatic master is *Duì* (☱, Joy), its hidden master is the lung, and it governs the west with *gēng xīn* (庚辛, Metal).\nIts nature returns to its origin; when subjected to water and fire’s consumption and refining, its hue shifts to yellow.\nThe yellow sprout signifies transformation, arising from water and fire’s consumption and refining.\n\nThe sage does not transmit this openly; instead, it is revealed through oral formulas.\nYellow governs the spleen and is the Central Palace (*Zhōnggōng*), ruled by *wù jǐ* (戊己, Earth).\nWhen the four substances converge into the Central Palace, the elixir is formed.\nAn ancient verse states:\n*\"The Dao is solitary yet complete—\nSuccess alone is its fulfillment,\nReturning to the Earth of the Middle.\"*\n\nThe liver’s azure is the father—Wood.\nThe lung’s white is the mother—Metal.\nThe kidney’s black is the child—Water.\nThe spleen’s yellow is Earth—Earth has no fixed form,\nThe sovereign rules through the four seasons,\nThe Five Phases mutually generate within it.\n\nThe Five Phases mutually generate and also mutually restrain.\nThus, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal—this is mutual generation.\nFire subjugates Metal, Metal subjugates Wood, Wood subjugates Earth, Earth subjugates Water, Water subjugates Fire—this is mutual restraint.\nThe *tooth* (yá) is Metal; it subdues Wood.\nThe *cinnabar* (shā) is Fire; it consumes Metal.\nLead is Water; it extinguishes Fire.\nWhen Water is abundant, Earth restrains it.\nCompleting its kind, restraining its *qi*—this is the principle of **reversed restraint**.\nAn ancient verse states:\n*\"Yellow Earth is the father of Metal,\nThe flowing pearl is the mother of Water.\nWater fears Earth as its specter—\nWhen Earth restrains Water, flames do not rise.\"*\n\nThis is the **one Water, two Fires, three Woods**—\nThe three natures converge, forming the core principle.\nYin and yang find their pairings,\nAnd tranquility arises naturally.\n\nClouds follow the Dragon,\nWinds follow the Tiger.\nShadows cling to form,\nEchoes answer speech.\nWater’s nature is moist and descending,\nFire’s nature is ardent and ascending.\nThe Great Return of the Golden Elixir follows this pattern.\n\nThe formula states:\n*\"Within yin lies its yang,\nWithin yang lies its yin.\nHaving recognized cinnabar within mercury,\nOne must seek the gold encased in lead.*\nThe two flavors are Heaven and Earth’s greatest treasures,\nThe Sun and Moon’s purest essences.\n\nThe Sun is akin to yang’s *qi* (arcanum)—\nIt loves movement and never rests,\nHence the golden rooster and its likeness.\nWhen yang peaks, yin arises—\nThus, the golden rooster within the Sun is yin.\n\nThe Moon is akin to yin’s *qi*—\nIt loves stillness and does not move,\nHence the silver hare and its likeness.\nWhen yin peaks, yang arises—\nThus, the silver hare within the Moon is yang.\n\nTherefore, Water without yang cannot bear,\nFire without yin cannot illuminate.\nYin *qi* descends from Heaven,\nYang *qi* ascends from Earth—\nClouds, rain, mist, and dew are its manifestations.\nThe male is white, the female is red—\nThus, they form the primordial pair.\nYin arises from yang,\nYang arises from yin—\nThis is the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nNow, four *liángs* (硫黃) of sulfur,\nRestrained with one *cǐn* (斤) of mercury,\nThe four *liángs* occupy the Central Palace,\nAll governed by Earth and Water’s mutual restraint,\nGradually merging into one.\n\nMercury within the sulfur is not mercury alone—\nThis is not its kind, and thus, it cannot form.\n\nPeople mistakenly consider sulfur as the *Great Yang* (Tàiyáng)—\nIncorrect. The Sun is the essence of the Great Yang,\nYet the golden rooster within it is yin.\nThus, the Sun contains the *Great Yin* (Tàiyīn) within its yang essence—\nThe golden rooster is it.\n\nSulfur is Earth; the eight stones are of its kind—\nNot the essences of yin and yang.\n\nTransformation arises from its truth,\nIts beginning and end are self-dependent.\n\nHú Gāng (狐剛), the son of Zǐ (子), asked:\n*\"The elixir of the Azure and Yellow—\nAll possess their truth.\nThe eight stones’ efficacy is not negligible.\nWhy does cinnabar alone secure longevity?\"*\n\nWèi Jūn (魏君) replied:\n*\"Femininity in stone, masculinity in sulfur—\nRepel malevolence, dispel evil.\nStone quartz and *zhuó* (鐘乳, stalactite)—\nNourish marrow, replenish essence.\nMagnetism when yang arises—\nTreat the kidney’s afflictions.\nCloud mother (*yǔnmǔ*, mica) when taken long—\nCold and heat cannot invade.\nJade fragments when consumed often—\nSpirit remains unscattered.\nCǒnggōng (孔公) purple stone—\nBody becomes plump and robust.\nFire mountain (*huǒshān*, sulfur) and cannon cinnabar—\nBreak *líng* (玲, phlegm) with immediate effect.\nOnce-green (*cèngqīng*, malachite) and empty-green (*kōngqīng*, azurite)—\nBoil mercury until it dries.\nAncient records and transmissions state:\nSulfur scatters *pì* (癖, phlegm).\nScriptures of the immortals declare:\nRed stone and cinnabar—\nNaturally, they do not die.\n\nIf one’s *qi* is weak, blood is scattered, body exhausted, and bones dry—\nThe eight stones’ efficacy can slightly enhance.\nIf one seeks longevity, eternal vision, preservation of life, and tranquility of spirit—\nOne must ingest cinnabar.\n\nThe eight stones meet fire, all become ash.\nCinnabar enters fire, transforming into quicksilver.\nIt can be heavy or light,\nDivine or responsive,\nDark or bright—\nThis is the nature of the Five Phases.\nWhen meeting fire, it ascends swiftly and lightly—\nGhosts and spirits seek it, yet cannot find.\n\nAll Dragon and Tiger interactions,\nTheir transformations are firm and steadfast.\n\nThe powdered form, when ingested, transforms the intestines into sinews.\nThus, when baked in clay, it becomes pottery that does not decay for a thousand years.\nWhen mixed into flesh, no corruption can dissolve it.\nThe Golden Elixir, once taken into the body, grants immortality for a thousand years.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe Golden Elixir enters the five viscera,\nIts mist disperses like wind and rain.\nIts vapors permeate the four limbs,\nBestowing radiant and youthful complexion.\nOld men become vigorous youths,\nAged women transform into bewitching maidens.\nTeeth and gums regenerate effortlessly,\nAnd one escapes the calamities of mortal life—\nThus, they are called *True Persons*.\nHow could the efficacy of the Golden Elixir\nBe compared to the eight stones?\n\nThe method of cultivating the Great Elixir\nDoes not lie in the abundance of ingredients,\nBut in the precise application of technique.\n\nAn ancient verse states:\n*\"If lead is true, it is a loyal retainer.\nIf lead is false, mercury will not unite with it.\"*\n\nThe *Green Waist Messenger* (once-green),\nThe *Red Blood General* (realgar),\nThe *White Tiger* (silver) as the brain,\nThe *Yellow Sprout* (yellow sprout) as the sinew.\n\nThe *White Tiger* is silver,\nThe *Yellow Sprout* is earth,\nThe *Green Waist* is once-green (copper sulfate),\nThe *Red Blood* is realgar.\n\n*Green Mist Master* said:\n*\"Lead is the fire’s retainer,\nMercury and wood are of the same lineage—\nThus, it is called a loyal retainer.\"*\n\nThe *Yellow Sprout* is the earth within the sand,\nThe root of the lineage.\nIts meaning is profound—\nA secret known only to the True Master.\n\n*Green Mist Master* said:\n*\"The Dao is not the ordinary Dao,\nMysterious beyond mystery.\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail.\nSudden in the void, its form emerges—\nThis is the Yang within Yin.\nSudden in the existent, its form vanishes—\nThis is the Yin within the intestines.\nWho names it the Yellow Sprout?\nIt is the union of husband and wife.\"*\n\n*Fox the Firm* asked: *\"What is the Yellow Sprout made of?\"*\n*Wei Gong* replied:\n*\"It uses lead, yet does not use lead.\nThe Five Metals are born from lead.\nLead is the marrow of the Five Metals,\nThe excellent mediator of the Seven Treasures,\nThe honored sovereign of the Eight Stones.\nThe Five Metals must avoid lead—\nDo not mistakenly employ it.\nRefined lead, refined lead—\nLead is refined into it.\"*\n\n*Fox the Firm* asked: *\"Fortunate to hear of the Yellow Sprout,\nI dare ask: What vessel is used to refine lead?\"*\n*Wei Gong* replied:\n*\"The cauldron is not a cauldron,\nThe medicine is not medicine.\nThe Yellow Sprout is not lead—\nIt must be forged within lead.\nTo recognize the Yellow Sprout,\nOne must not stray from lead’s foundation.\nWithout the Yellow Sprout’s gate,\nEven lead must be misapplied.\"*\n\n*Green Mist Master* said:\n*\"If the Sprout is lead, abandon lead ten thousand miles.\nIf the Sprout is not lead, begin with lead.\nLead is the Sprout’s mother,\nThe Sprout is lead’s child.\nIf one obtains the Golden Flower,\nLead is discarded and not used.\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"The cauldron is not a golden cauldron,\nThe furnace is not a Yue furnace.\nFrom Kan’s depths, it ascends,\nIn the soil of Dui, it resides.\nWhen the three natures converge,\nThe two essences naturally unite.\nThe embryo is secured, unspilled,\nTransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nThe secret states:\n*\"White gold is the sovereign,\nThe essence of black lead,\nOf the Western position,\nYet containing the essence of Minor Yang.\nFurther refined within lead,\nIts divine function becomes true.\nIn the ash-pit’s furnace,\nLead sinks, silver floats—\nThis is called Yellow Lightness,\nAlso the Golden Flower,\nAlso Autumn Stone,\nAlso Yellow Sprout.\nIts nature is subtly warm—\nAlready a treasure of longevity.\nYet, the lone Yang’s fang is insufficient.\nOnly when Yin and Yang unite\nDo they become sovereign and minister.\nThus, the Yellow Emperor obtained the beauty of the Golden Flower,\nAnd thus it is called *Beautiful Golden Flower*.\"*\n\nThe *Huainan King* said of Autumn Stone:\n*\"The eighth month’s node,\nThe Western position—\nBecause of its white color,\nIt is called Autumn Stone.\"*\n\n*Wang Yang* called it the Yellow Sprout,\n*\"Because its yellow hue resembles the first sprouts of all things,\nThus it is called Yellow Sprout.\"*\n\nIts essence originates from one source,\nYet it is named differently by each master.\n\nOnce-green (copper sulfate) is the *qi*,\nIlluminating the four quarters.\nRealgar is the *messenger*,\nIts brilliance radiant.\nLike a trustworthy mediator,\nThey unite and mutually assist—\nWhen the great work is complete,\nEach has its designated role.\n\nThe Eight Stones are abandoned,\nWhile the Yellow emerges from Wudu.\nOnly gold and water\nDazzle like pearls of light.\nUnderstand its meaning,\nAnd the divine path will support you.\n\nThe secret states:\n*\"Gold’s nature is refined,\nBorn from the utmost Yang.\nMercury is produced from cinnabar.\nStone’s nature is hot,\nBorn from the utmost Yin.\nSilver is produced from lead.\nThe two essences each obtain the original *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\nWater and fire consume and refine—\nStone sinks, gold floats.\nSovereign and minister reverse,\nYin becomes Yang,\nSovereign becomes minister—\nOnly then do Yin and Yang rely on each other,\nSovereign and minister harmonize.\nThis is the supreme mystery of the Immortals,\nThe origin of the Great Dao.\nAbove and below, water and fire,\nRise and fall according to time—\nThousands of transformations, ten thousand changes,\nNone surpass the interplay of lead and mercury.\nLike things gather,\nOpposing things cannot form a single kind.\nThus, sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes,\nFoxes do not nurse colts—\nHence, the necessity of kindred affinity.\"*\n\n*Green Mist Master* said:\n*\"All things teem and return to their roots.\nGold is born from water,\nThe gateway to all marvels.\nWhen Yin and Yang ignite,\nAbove and below surge—\nThe divine embryo is unspilled,\nThe spirit is bound, the soul confined.\nLike things unite,\nOpposing things separate—\nSparrows do not birth phoenixes,\nFoxes are not horses in drought.\"*\n\nThe secret states:\n*\"Eight *liang* of Yellow Sprout,\nBelongs to Heaven, to Firmness, to the Yang Dragon.\nEight *liang* of mercury,\nBelongs to Earth, to Softness, to the Yin Tiger.\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth, Firm and Soft,\nYin and Yang, Dragon and Tiger.\nEight *liang* of fang (tooth),\nEight *liang* of mercury,\nTogether making one *jin*—\nIn accordance with the two strings [of the *Luo* vessel].\nEach *liang* has four *fen*,\nSixty-four *fen* in total—\nIn accordance with the sixty-four hexagrams.\nEach *fen* has six *chǐ* (dram),\nTotaling three hundred eighty-four *chǐ*—\nIn accordance with the three hundred eighty-four lines.\nAlso symbolizing a year’s three hundred sixty days,\nTogether with the twenty-four seasons,\nCompleting the number three hundred eighty-four.\nOne for Water,\nTwo for Fire,\nThree for Wood,\nFour for Metal,\nFive for Earth—\nIn accordance with the Five Phases.\nFive days make a *hou* (watch),\nForty-five days make a node—\nThus, the ancients relied on the *Yijing* for its symbolism.\"*\n\nThe solitary Yin cannot form, the solitary Yang cannot generate—\nOnly when Yin and Yang unite does the Dao flourish.\n\nIts medicine, like a child in the womb,\nOr a fruit upon the tree,\nIs seen only when ripe,\nYet its transformations remain unfathomable.\n\nFirm yet yielding, it is meticulously refined,\nNo leakage allowed—\nArising from the hour of *Yin* (3 AM),\nPeaking at the hour of *Wu* (noon),\nAnd ending at the hour of *Xu* (7 PM).\n\nAt first, Fire—one Yang—gives birth to the *Gèn* (Restoring) hexagram,\nProceeding through *Lín* (Approaching), *Tài* (Peace), *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength),\n*Yáng* (Nourishing), *Qián* (The Creative), *Rùn* (The Receptive),\n*Dùn* (Retreat), *Pǐ* (Opposition), *Guān* (Contemplation), *Bō* (Shedding),\n*Kūn* (The Receptive)—\nUntil at *Rùn*, the Fire is extinguished,\nAnd at *Kūn*, the process concludes.\n\nIts medicine, when attaining the flavor of Metal, is pungent;\nWhen attaining the flavor of Wood, is sour;\nWhen attaining the flavor of Water, is salty;\nWhen attaining the flavor of Fire, is bitter—\nCirculating through the four directions,\nAnd returning to the central palace,\nWhere it attains the flavor of Earth and is sweet.\n\nThus it is called the *Huan Dan* (Returning Elixir) of the Five Phases,\nIts flavors complete, returning to the central palace of *Wu Ji* (Earth).\nOnly then does it earn the name *Huan Dan*.\n\nNow, what is called *Dan* is but the name for its red hue.\n*Huan* means returning to its original essence.\nIf its flavor is not sweet,\nThough it bears a red hue, it is not *Huan Dan*.\n\nWhen the Five Phases traverse the twelve hexagrams,\nAnd complete the cycle of two eights (16),\nIt does not exceed one *jin*—\nFrom the lower to the upper strings,\nPenetrating the Great Dao,\nBeyond the grasp of ghosts and spirits,\nBeyond the knowledge of sages and worthies.\n\nThe medicine is formed from mercury,\nLike fruit from flowers bearing fruit,\nLike a child shaped by *qi*,\nAnd the medicine from Metal and Water forming the elixir—\nOnly sages and worthies can reveal the transformations within the furnace.\n\nYet the heavens and earth naturally achieve success—\nThis is the wondrous Dao of *Xuanhua* (Mysterious Transformation).\n\nThe words of the *Tàishàng* (Supreme) are not to be transmitted to the unworthy,\nFor the sin extends to seven generations.\nIf one who receives it does not transmit it,\nThey too will suffer the consequences.\n\nThus the ancient sages inscribed it,\nAnd hid it in the stone chamber and golden coffer—\nLet those who find it take it as a solemn warning.\n\nThe fire regimen begins with half a *jīn* (斤) in the eleventh month,\nOne *jīn* in the twelfth month,\nOne and a half *jīn* in the first month,\nNo fire in the second month,\nTwo *jīn* in the third month,\nOne and a half *jīn* in the fourth month,\nTwo *jīn* in the fifth month,\nOne and a half *jīn* in the sixth month,\nOne *jīn* in the seventh month,\nNo fire in the eighth month,\nHalf a *jīn* in the ninth month,\nFour *liǎng* (两) in the tenth month—\nuntil the fifteenth day to open the furnace.\n\nIf one wishes to refine the nurturing medicine,\nfirst place it in the small furnace,\nfor fifteen days,\nthen measure the portion without reduction,\nand transfer it to the large furnace,\ncommencing from the eleventh month,\nuntil the *Mào-Yǒu* (卯) and *Yǒu-Xiù* (酉) hexagrams,\nwhen no fire is used—\nthus, the elixir is formed in ten months.\n\n*Zǐ-Chǒu-Yín* (子丑寅) belong to spring,\n*Mào-Chén-Sì* (卯辰巳) to summer—\nthese six months are of pure *yáng* (阳) energy in operation,\nwhere *yīn* (阴) seeks *yáng*,\nand Water enters Metal.\n\n*Wǔ-Wèi-Shēn* (午未申) belong to autumn,\n*Yǒu-Hài-Xū* (酉亥戌) to winter—\nthese six months are of pure *yīn* energy in operation,\nwhere *yáng* seeks *yīn*,\nand Metal enters Water.\n\nThe two *qì* (气) mutually vaporize—\nthe forms of Metal and Water constantly transform,\nshifting without fixed direction,\nneither ascending nor descending remains constant.\nWater gains Metal and ascends,\nMetal gains Water and descends—\nmutually relying, they undergo transformation,\ncondensing within the vessel,\nthe body of the *Huándān* (还丹) elixir—\ntruly wondrous, truly wondrous!\n\nLater gentlemen should not rashly discuss it.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) truly spoke:\n\"Within a hundred years of receiving my text,\none may transmit it to three persons.\"\n\nThirty years may transmit to one person.\nIf there is no one of like mind,\nwrite a copy in thirty years,\nexhausting its principles,\nand conceal it in a cave of a sacred mountain,\nawaiting those of destiny to obtain it.\n\nMaster Dongyu of Shuyue received it in the fifth year of Zhengyuan [800 CE]\nfrom the recluse Qingxia Zi of Luofu Mountain.\nIn the nineteenth year of Zhengyuan [814 CE],\nhe transmitted it to the Prefectural Secretary Zhang Tao of Jianzhou.\nIn the third year of Kaicheng [838 CE],\nit was passed to his kinsman Li Fen in the capital.\nIn the fifth year of Changqi [841 CE],\nit was transmitted to the recluse Chengjun.\n\nThe oral instructions are not recorded in the text—\nkeep them secret, keep them secret.\n\nThe song says:\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first divided, the sun and moon ascended high,\nLike a chicken egg, like a peach.\nThe true *qi* of *yīn* and *yáng* knows the seasons,\nWaiting three years to shed the armor of battle.\n\nThe Great Dao is clear before one’s eyes,\nYet common folk misunderstand and return to the source.\n\nThe yellow sprout is the *qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nIts divine foundation linked with mercury.\nThe *Lóng-Hǔ* (龙虎) elixir’s essence is most profound—\nWithin the Five *Shén* (神), mercury and lead flow.\n\nA thousand autumns pass as purple clouds take flight,\nAscending to the head of the Great Luo Heaven.\n\nRecognizing the root source, there is no need for haste—\nThree threes combine to nine, pure *yáng* refined.\n\nThe hidden light of transformation shines forth,\nFrom this point, ascending to Heaven draws near the Jade Emperor.\n\nTo use lead, one must obtain mercury to harmonize,\nTheir two natures as parents—sing the song of the daughter.\n\nWhen refined to the *Zǐchē* (紫河车) stage, the earth trembles,\nWhite clouds accompany the crane’s arrival.\n\nUniting Heaven and Earth, uniting the primal,\nWhen child and mother meet, one dare not speak.\n\nFirst mercury, then lead—this is the true Great Dao,\nDo not let the crane depart without its companion.\n\nThis treasure has always been transmitted in twos and eights,\nIn auspicious years and months, placed in the furnace.\n\nA thousand autumns’ fire follows the season,\nNecessarily sprouting as mercury dries.\n\nThe essence of *Lóng-Hǔ* is complete.",

      "translated_text": "**The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger**\n\n**Title:** *The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger* (Lónghǔ Yuánzhǐ).\n**Transmitted by:** Tang Master Dong Shi (董師元), compiled by Cheng Jun (成君).\n**One scroll.** Source of the original text: *The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Dynasty* (Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng), **Too Xuan Department** (太玄部).\n\n---\n\n**The Fundamental Essence of the Dragon and Tiger**\n\nThe *Dragon and Tiger* refer to *lead and mercury* (yín gǒng). Mercury is the Dragon, lead is the Tiger.\nThe mother conceals the child within her womb; the child hides within the mother’s embrace.\nKnow the white while guarding the black; divine clarity will naturally arise.\n\nThe white is the essence of gold (*jīn*), the black is the foundation of water (*shuǐ*).\nThe method of using lead is subtle and profound—this is what is meant.\n\nThat which cannot be recognized must be known; merely rely on Heaven’s nature, and it will be encountered naturally.\n\nNow, take Heaven’s *qi* (arcanum), add Earth’s *qi* (arcanum), and combine the essences of the Sun and Moon to form the Dao of yin and yang.\nMercury is the Azure Dragon, its trigrammatic master is *Zhèn* (☳, Thunder), its hidden master is the liver, and it governs the east with *jiǎ yǐ* (甲乙, Wood).\nWood can generate fire; its original form is azure, but when it meets fire, it becomes vermilion—thus, it transforms into *cinnabar* (dānshā).\nIt becomes the Vermilion Bird, its trigrammatic master is *Lí* (☲, Flame), its hidden master is the heart, and it governs the south with *bǐng dīng* (丙丁, Fire).\nLí is yang; when yang reaches its peak, yin arises—thus, cinnabar generates mercury within it.\nThe two strokes in Lí represent the golden rooster (yīng).\nThe golden rooster within the Sun is also yin.\n\nLead is the Dark Turtle, its trigrammatic master is *Kàn* (☵, Abyss), its hidden master is the kidney, and it governs the north with *rén guǐ* (壬癸, Water).\nKàn is yin; when yin reaches its peak, yang arises—thus, lead contains white gold within it.\nThe one stroke in Kàn represents the silver hare (yù).\nThe silver hare within the Moon is also yang.\n\nGold is the White Tiger, its trigrammatic master is *Duì* (☱, Joy), its hidden master is the lung, and it governs the west with *gēng xīn* (庚辛, Metal).\nIts nature returns to its origin; when subjected to water and fire’s consumption and refining, its hue shifts to yellow.\nThe yellow sprout signifies transformation, arising from water and fire’s consumption and refining.\n\nThe sage does not transmit this openly; instead, it is revealed through oral formulas.\nYellow governs the spleen and is the Central Palace (*Zhōnggōng*), ruled by *wù jǐ* (戊己, Earth).\nWhen the four substances converge into the Central Palace, the elixir is formed.\nAn ancient verse states:\n*\"The Dao is solitary yet complete—\nSuccess alone is its fulfillment,\nReturning to the Earth of the Middle.\"*\n\nThe liver’s azure is the father—Wood.\nThe lung’s white is the mother—Metal.\nThe kidney’s black is the child—Water.\nThe spleen’s yellow is Earth—Earth has no fixed form,\nThe sovereign rules through the four seasons,\nThe Five Phases mutually generate within it.\n\nThe Five Phases mutually generate and also mutually restrain.\nThus, Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal—this is mutual generation.\nFire subjugates Metal, Metal subjugates Wood, Wood subjugates Earth, Earth subjugates Water, Water subjugates Fire—this is mutual restraint.\nThe *tooth* (yá) is Metal; it subdues Wood.\nThe *cinnabar* (shā) is Fire; it consumes Metal.\nLead is Water; it extinguishes Fire.\nWhen Water is abundant, Earth restrains it.\nCompleting its kind, restraining its *qi*—this is the principle of **reversed restraint**.\nAn ancient verse states:\n*\"Yellow Earth is the father of Metal,\nThe flowing pearl is the mother of Water.\nWater fears Earth as its specter—\nWhen Earth restrains Water, flames do not rise.\"*\n\nThis is the **one Water, two Fires, three Woods**—\nThe three natures converge, forming the core principle.\nYin and yang find their pairings,\nAnd tranquility arises naturally.\n\nClouds follow the Dragon,\nWinds follow the Tiger.\nShadows cling to form,\nEchoes answer speech.\nWater’s nature is moist and descending,\nFire’s nature is ardent and ascending.\nThe Great Return of the Golden Elixir follows this pattern.\n\nThe formula states:\n*\"Within yin lies its yang,\nWithin yang lies its yin.\nHaving recognized cinnabar within mercury,\nOne must seek the gold encased in lead.*\nThe two flavors are Heaven and Earth’s greatest treasures,\nThe Sun and Moon’s purest essences.\n\nThe Sun is akin to yang’s *qi* (arcanum)—\nIt loves movement and never rests,\nHence the golden rooster and its likeness.\nWhen yang peaks, yin arises—\nThus, the golden rooster within the Sun is yin.\n\nThe Moon is akin to yin’s *qi*—\nIt loves stillness and does not move,\nHence the silver hare and its likeness.\nWhen yin peaks, yang arises—\nThus, the silver hare within the Moon is yang.\n\nTherefore, Water without yang cannot bear,\nFire without yin cannot illuminate.\nYin *qi* descends from Heaven,\nYang *qi* ascends from Earth—\nClouds, rain, mist, and dew are its manifestations.\nThe male is white, the female is red—\nThus, they form the primordial pair.\nYin arises from yang,\nYang arises from yin—\nThis is the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.\n\nNow, four *liángs* (硫黃) of sulfur,\nRestrained with one *cǐn* (斤) of mercury,\nThe four *liángs* occupy the Central Palace,\nAll governed by Earth and Water’s mutual restraint,\nGradually merging into one.\n\nMercury within the sulfur is not mercury alone—\nThis is not its kind, and thus, it cannot form.\n\nPeople mistakenly consider sulfur as the *Great Yang* (Tàiyáng)—\nIncorrect. The Sun is the essence of the Great Yang,\nYet the golden rooster within it is yin.\nThus, the Sun contains the *Great Yin* (Tàiyīn) within its yang essence—\nThe golden rooster is it.\n\nSulfur is Earth; the eight stones are of its kind—\nNot the essences of yin and yang.\n\nTransformation arises from its truth,\nIts beginning and end are self-dependent.\n\nHú Gāng (狐剛), the son of Zǐ (子), asked:\n*\"The elixir of the Azure and Yellow—\nAll possess their truth.\nThe eight stones’ efficacy is not negligible.\nWhy does cinnabar alone secure longevity?\"*\n\nWèi Jūn (魏君) replied:\n*\"Femininity in stone, masculinity in sulfur—\nRepel malevolence, dispel evil.\nStone quartz and *zhuó* (鐘乳, stalactite)—\nNourish marrow, replenish essence.\nMagnetism when yang arises—\nTreat the kidney’s afflictions.\nCloud mother (*yǔnmǔ*, mica) when taken long—\nCold and heat cannot invade.\nJade fragments when consumed often—\nSpirit remains unscattered.\nCǒnggōng (孔公) purple stone—\nBody becomes plump and robust.\nFire mountain (*huǒshān*, sulfur) and cannon cinnabar—\nBreak *líng* (玲, phlegm) with immediate effect.\nOnce-green (*cèngqīng*, malachite) and empty-green (*kōngqīng*, azurite)—\nBoil mercury until it dries.\nAncient records and transmissions state:\nSulfur scatters *pì* (癖, phlegm).\nScriptures of the immortals declare:\nRed stone and cinnabar—\nNaturally, they do not die.\n\nIf one’s *qi* is weak, blood is scattered, body exhausted, and bones dry—\nThe eight stones’ efficacy can slightly enhance.\nIf one seeks longevity, eternal vision, preservation of life, and tranquility of spirit—\nOne must ingest cinnabar.\n\nThe eight stones meet fire, all become ash.\nCinnabar enters fire, transforming into quicksilver.\nIt can be heavy or light,\nDivine or responsive,\nDark or bright—\nThis is the nature of the Five Phases.\nWhen meeting fire, it ascends swiftly and lightly—\nGhosts and spirits seek it, yet cannot find.\n\nAll Dragon and Tiger interactions,\nTheir transformations are firm and steadfast.",
