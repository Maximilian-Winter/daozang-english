  "full_translation": "**Record of the Mystic Pearl**\n\nThe dharmas of the ten directions may all be spoken of.\nYet all spoken dharmas are illusory and false;\neven the unspoken dharma is illusory in contrast to this falsity.\nIf spoken dharmas are false, then the unspoken is also false.\nSince all these are equally false, where then is the true?\nYet if all these false dharmas are in truth real,\nwhy were the former called false?\nBecause speech arises, and thus falsity is spoken.\nWhy then is truth spoken?\nBecause speech arises.\nAnd why does speech arise? To reach that which is beyond.\nWhy must that be heard? To penetrate the mind.\nAnd why penetrate the mind? To attain the Dao.\n\nAll things are born bearing the Dao,\nall things undergo change and transformation,\nyet the Dao itself knows no change or transformation.\nThus, movement does not depart from stillness.\nSince things bear the Dao, when things differ, the Dao also differs—\nthis is the Dao’s response to things.\nPress a seal into clay: though the clay bears countless impressions,\nthe original seal’s characters do not diminish.\nThough the original characters do not diminish,\nthey can imprint many clays,\nand the characters in the clay are identical to those of the original seal.\nThus it is said: “Having given to others, one possesses even more.”\n\nThe Dao is nowhere absent; all belongs to the Dao’s response.\nIf one takes the responsive as real,\nthen where it does not respond should not exist—\nyet if it responds, that response is dead.\nIf one takes the unresponsive as real,\nthen where it responds, the unresponsive is dead.\nWhere then is the Dao?\nIf one takes the ultimate as real,\nthen both the possible and the impossible are the Dao.\nIf one takes it as unreal,\nthen both the possible and the impossible are not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao resides between realm and wisdom,\nit abides between knowing and unknowing.\nTrace the thread of inquiry, and one attains perfect rectitude.\nThe true nature of rectitude unites in virtue with emptiness.\nThrough emptiness, it can give rise and cease,\nyet it neither arises nor ceases.\nThe Dao pervades all things, and thus things are the Dao.\nSince things arise and cease, the Dao also arises and ceases.\nIf things are contingent, then the Dao is entirely things.\nIf the Dao is eternal, then things are entirely impermanent.\n\nThe sutra states: “Unable to distinguish the false from the true,\nhow does one practice the true Dao?”\nAnswer: When the realm is exhausted and practice is complete,\nthis is called the correct Dao.\nExpanding the mind to pervade the realm,\nemerging from wisdom to rely on the other—\nwhen the other is fully encompassed,\nit becomes the great body.\nOnce the great body is established,\nthe small self dissolves,\nand together with the small self,\nit merges with the realm’s divisions.\n\nAlways take the mind-Dao as the agent,\nand the realm-body as the object;\nagent and object interact.\nWhen the dharma-realm is perfectly complete,\nagent and object each cease,\nand the true essence remains eternally still.\n\nQuestion: The sutra says, “The Dao is intertwined with sentient beings.”\nHow are they the same or different?\nAnswer: The Dao and sentient beings are both the same and different,\nboth eternal and impermanent.\nWhy?\nThe Dao and sentient beings arise interdependently—thus they are the same.\nSentient beings arise and cease, while the Dao neither arises nor ceases—thus they are different.\nDifferent dharmas do not occupy the same place,\nand their names do not depend on one another.\n\nObjection: If names do not depend on one another,\nhow can they be called “same,” “different,” “eternal,” or “impermanent”?\nAnswer: Since each dharma has no comparison and no cause,\nhow can it have a name?\nIf one allows names to exist,\nit is clear that one dharma has two names.\nIf one allows names to be absent,\nit is clear that one dharma has no name.\nAnswer: I merely forcefully apply names,\nand thus they come to exist.\nThough forced, in that moment of forcing,\nit is both same and different, both eternal and impermanent.\nWhen forgotten, in that moment of forgetting,\nit is neither same nor different, neither eternal nor impermanent.\nThe true nature of this dharma\nis neither forced nor unforced,\nneither eternal nor impermanent.\nHow can names be forcibly established in the nameless?\n\nAnswer: To enter silence is difficult.\nIf this dharma were definitively silence,\nthere would be no one in the world who forces speech.\nYet if there are those who force speech,\nthen silence is not truly real.\nFurther answer: It is precisely because silence is seen\nthat within it, all forced speech is seen.\nSince silence is originally absent,\nit is clear that forced speech is also absent.\n\nThe treatise states: “The nature of the Dao and the nature of sentient beings\nare both identical to spontaneity.”\nSentient beings are born bearing the Dao—\nare sentient beings the Dao?\nAnswer: Sentient beings are born bearing the Dao,\nbut sentient beings are not the Dao.\nWhy? Because they are not the Dao,\nthey must cultivate and practice.\nObjection: If sentient beings are not the Dao,\nyet through cultivation attain the Dao,\nthen the Dao is attained outside the self.\nSentient beings are not originally so—\nhow can one speak of attaining the Dao through cultivation?\nSentient beings have an impermanent nature,\nand thus through cultivation they attain the Dao.\nThe Dao has no impermanent nature,\nand thus it responds to sentient beings’ cultivation.\nSentient beings do not name themselves—\nit is through the Dao that they first gain a name.\nThe Dao does not name itself—\nit is through sentient beings that it gains a name.\nIf names arise through dependence,\nit is clear that within the Dao there are sentient beings,\nand within sentient beings there is the Dao.\nThus, sentient beings are not the Dao.\nYet through cultivation, the Dao is attained—\nthus the Dao is not sentient beings.\nSince it responds to sentient beings’ cultivation,\nthe Dao is therefore sentient beings,\nand sentient beings are therefore the Dao.\nWhen arising, they arise simultaneously;\nwhen forgotten, they are forgotten simultaneously.\nThe true nature of this dharma\nis neither arising nor forgetting,\nnor is it neither arising nor forgetting.\nEnter equality and abide in it—\nthe practitioner realizes it.\nWhen principle is attained, abide in it;\nwithin abiding, when forgetting is present, observe;\nwithin observation, when penetration is attained, abide.\n\nThe Dao and sentient beings are mutually dependent.\nIf there are sentient beings, there is the Dao;\nif there are no sentient beings, there is no Dao.\nSentient beings and the Dao share the same essence,\nsentient beings and the Dao both follow the same course—\nwhy then establish teachings and exclusively urge sentient beings to cultivate?\nIf sentient beings attain the Dao,\nthey attain the Dao apart from cultivation.\nIf the Dao responds to sentient beings,\nthe Dao is apart from what is practiced.\nThe sutra does not permit attachment—\nhow then can there be cultivation?\nWhat is called cultivation\nis a name established on the basis of delusion.\nSince deluded dharmas are not real,\nthe teachings are all dregs.\nWhy cling to teachings and speak of cultivation?\nThus, the Dao, sentient beings, and teachings—\nall three cannot be obtained.\n\nSince the three cannot be obtained, they are also not mere emptiness.\nNeither united nor separate, thus is the true reality.\nSentient beings and the Dao do not depart from one another.\n\nWhen among sentient beings, the Dao is hidden and sentient beings appear;\nwhen in the state of attaining the Dao, the Dao appears and sentient beings are hidden.\nOnly their concealment and revelation differ—\nnot a distinction of existence or nonexistence.\n\nThus, when the Dao has not yet manifested,\none cultivates to dispel its concealment;\nwhen sentient beings have not yet receded,\none relinquishes the three poisons to dispel their revelation.\nIf sentient beings recede,\nthe Great Dao becomes perfectly unobstructed,\nand perfect unobstruction is the reception of bliss.\n\nWhen the Dao is concealed,\nsentient beings are all afflicted,\nand affliction is suffering.\nAvoiding suffering and desiring bliss,\none teaches to dispel through cultivation.\nOnce cultivation is realized,\none departs from cultivation and further departs from teachings—\nwherever one abides, there is liberation,\nprovisionally named \"profound truth.\"\n\nThe Dao constantly follows birth and death,\naccompanying them without separation.\nThough sentient beings are born, the Dao is not born;\nthough sentient beings die, the Dao does not die.\nIf sentient beings die, their Dao unites with death;\nif sentient beings are born, their Dao unites with birth.\nOnly when birth departs from death and constantly unites with the Dao\ncan there be \"thus\" or \"not thus.\"\nIf death could unite with the living,\nthen there would be no Dao;\nif birth could unite with the dead,\nthen there would be no Dao.\nThe Dao is neither \"thus\" nor \"not thus\"—\nthus one knows the Dao is constant.\nBirth and death are not constant,\nyet beyond birth and death there is no separate Dao,\nand beyond the Dao there is no separate birth and death.\n\nBirth and death and the Dao do not abandon one another,\nnor have they ever truly merged.\nBecause birth and death are constant,\nthey cannot be merged;\nbecause they are not abandoned,\nthey cannot be separated.\n\nEntering sameness, one follows sameness to enter contemplation;\nthrough contemplation, one attains penetration and abides.\nWhen abiding, if one forgets, one contemplates again.\nContemplation does not hinder abiding,\nnor does abiding hinder contemplation.\nContemplation abides in abiding,\nand abiding abides in contemplation.\nAbiding and contemplation are neither one nor two,\nyet both one and two—\nentering sameness, one contemplates and abides again.\n\nIf all dharmas arise,\nthere is nothing that does not arise.\nArising belongs to sentient beings—\nhow could the essence of the Dao ever arise?\nIf all dharmas are forgotten,\nthere is nothing that is not forgotten.\nForgetting belongs to sentient beings—\nhow could the essence of the Dao ever be forgotten?\nThe true nature of the Dao\nis neither arising nor forgetting.\nFrom what do arising and forgetting arise?\nThe Dao does not pervade arising and forgetting—\nhow then can it be named the Dao?\nHow can arising and forgetting be named?\nOnly through arising and forgetting is the true nature known,\nand only through the true nature are arising and forgetting recognized.\nCompletion occurs in a single instant,\nand cessation occurs in a single instant.\n\nEntering sameness, one compares brightness and darkness:\nthough they arise and cease, they have never abandoned emptiness.\nThough emptiness abides constantly,\nit has never abandoned brightness and darkness.\nBrightness and darkness arise and cease,\nbut emptiness does not arise or cease.\nEmptiness contains brightness and darkness,\nyet brightness and darkness are not emptiness.\nOnly brightness, darkness, and emptiness—\nemptiness is also brightness and darkness.\nBrightness, darkness, and emptiness\nhave never been one, nor have they ever been two;\nthey are both one and two,\nyet neither one nor two—\nentering sameness, one abides thus.\n\nOne constantly takes what is known as one’s own body,\nand what knows as one’s own mind.\nKnowing, seeing, and the like are the Dao that can be spoken of;\nthe emptiness of knowing and seeing is the true Dao.\nKnowing and seeing without limit is the great body;\nseeing semblances is like striking the eye,\nhearing semblances is like the great ear.\nRecognizing what is known is the great mind;\nthe emptiness of the great mind is liberation.\nLiberation is the exhaustion of the mind’s outflows,\nand the exhaustion of the mind’s outflows is the exhaustion of the body’s outflows.\nYet the body’s outflows are not nonexistent—\nin this state, the essence is constantly empty.\n\nThe one who contemplates and what is contemplated\nboth belong to the mind,\nand both belong to the realm of objects.\nMind and realm of objects,\neach abiding in its own place, do not come or go—\nfrom where then do they arise?\nIf one awakens to the non-arising of arising,\none attains stability of mind.\n\nAll sentient beings who seek the Dao\nmust extinguish knowing and seeing.\nOnly when knowing and seeing are completely extinguished\ncan the Dao be attained.\nThough knowing and seeing naturally cease after the death of sentient beings,\nwhy exert painful effort to cultivate,\nforcibly extinguishing knowing and seeing?\n\nExplanation:\nDeath is not freely chosen;\nat the time of death, one dies by another’s agency.\nAfter death, knowing and seeing cease—\nthis cessation is also by another’s agency.\nWhen the next life arises,\nbirth occurs by another’s agency.\nKnowing and seeing arise with birth,\nthus the body is bound,\nand the Dao is not attained.\nIf, while the body has not yet ceased,\nknowing and seeing are already absent,\nthen at the time of future birth,\none will naturally not receive rebirth.\nWithout birth, there is no knowing and seeing—\nthus liberation is attained.\n\nPraise:\nDeath is not freely chosen;\nafter death, there is another birth.\nIf knowing and seeing extinguish the self,\nthen by the self, there is no future birth.\nThe body’s burdens must be resolved first.\nWhen all existences within the body are empty,\nthat emptiness is also empty,\nand the mind roams the heavens.\nWhen both emptiness and existence are empty,\nthe mind is without attachment.\nGuiding and restraining people,\none follows their beginnings and ends.\nWhy is this?\nBecause people and the cycle arise together.\n\nObjection:\nWhere does this cycle reside?\nThe cycle of people does not increase—\nhow then can there be a cycle?\n\nAnswer:\nObserve this cycle carefully—\nit does not lie outside the cycle of people,\nyet this cycle exists.\nThe cycle is neither sound nor form—\nultimately, all is empty.\nPractitioners should know\nthat knowing is the same as not knowing.\nWho would there be to know?\nIn this state, there is neither non-knowing\nnor the existence of knowing.\nIt is also said:\nIf there is knowing, then there is the name \"not knowing.\"\nKnowing is fundamentally nonexistent—\nthere is no such thing as \"no not-knowing.\"\nOriginally, there is no knowing in the mind;\nonly when facing objects does knowing arise.\nThe mind is not without knowing—\nwithout objects, there is no knowing.\nThis is also true of firewood and fire.\nThus it is said:\nThe impermanent can be made permanent,\nand the permanent can be made impermanent.\nBecause of the presence or absence of objects,\nthere is knowing and not knowing;\nwithout the presence or absence of objects,\nthere is neither knowing nor not knowing.\nWith knowing, there is not knowing;\nthere are things one does not know.\nWithout knowing, there is no not knowing—\nthere is nothing one does not know.\nThus it is said:\nWhat the body sees—\nold kingdoms, old capitals—\ngazing upon them brings joy.\nHow much more so the return to the city of the nature and essence of no-knowing!\n\nThen it is wondrously clear!\n\nWhen the mind faces objects, mind and objects arise together;\nif objects do not disturb the mind, it is the mind that deludedly arises.\nThe mind does not arise of itself—it arises because of objects.\nWithout the mind, objects do not arise of themselves;\nwithout objects, the mind also does not arise of itself.\n\nWhat can be spoken of is the provisional Dao;\nthe constant Dao is the true Dao.\nIf one abides in these,\nthis constant will indeed become provisional.\n\nWhy?\nThe constant alone abides in constancy and does not pervade the provisional,\nthus this constant faces the provisional,\nand so its constancy becomes provisional.\n\nUtterances arise and emerge into the world—\nspeaking of constancy is also speaking of the provisional.\nSince constancy and provisionality are originally nonexistent,\nthere is also no non-constancy or non-provisionality.\n\nIf among the manifold words,\none observes their subtleties through speech,\nif one awakens to the emptiness of manifold words,\none observes their wonder without desire.\n\nSubstance and function are not the same—\nwhy?\nSubstance is not function,\nfunction is not substance.\n\nObserve carefully:\nwhen substance moves, it becomes function,\nand that function is indeed substance;\nwhen function ceases and returns to substance,\nthat substance is function.\n\nPreserve them, and there are four;\nforget them, and there is not one.\n\nAmong the inexhaustible dharmas under heaven,\nnone surpass being and non-being.\nWithin all being and non-being,\nnone surpass constancy and annihilation.\n\nWhat is born does not exceed the four kinds of birth;\nwhere birth resides does not exceed the great Dao.\n\nNot only is the provisional Dao provisional,\nthe constant Dao is also provisional;\nnot only is the constant Dao constant,\nthe provisional Dao is also constant.\n\nAll arise through mutual dependence,\nyet their arising is no arising;\nthey also perish through mutual dependence,\nyet their perishing is no perishing.\n\nViews of emptiness and views of existence\nboth reside within the one mind.\nIf this mind is also nonexistent,\nwhere then would views of emptiness and existence reside?\n\nAll mental states and their meanings\nare likewise so.\n\nTherefore, when the mind arises, all dharmas arise;\nwhen the mind ceases, all dharmas cease.\nIf one realizes the mindless,\nthere is certainly no arising, nor any ceasing.\n\nIn the constant, there are four truths:\none is constant, two are not.\nTo equalize them is to fall into the one;\nwithout equalization, the one is not seen.\nThe Dao is both equalization and non-equalization.\n\nAbandon sageliness and discard wisdom,\nfrom the ordinary attain sageliness—\nthis sageliness still faces the ordinary.\nWhen one is in the ordinary,\nit has long since departed with the ordinary;\nsince the ordinary has departed, sageliness also departs.\n\nWhen both ordinary and sagely are forgotten,\nthere is no wisdom and no benevolence,\nfew desires and return to the Dao.\n\nQuestion: If abandoning sageliness has led to sageliness,\nmay one be permitted to abandon it?\nFor one who has not yet attained sageliness,\nhow should one dispel the abandonment?\n\nAnswer: We speak only of one who has attained sageliness,\nnot of one who has not.\nOne who has not attained has no sageliness—\nhow can one speak of no-sageliness?\n\nThe great Dao responds to nature,\nyet this nature is not visible.\nThe natures of foolish and wise beings—\nboth natures are not visible.\n\nBecause they are not visible,\nthey can unite with the utmost mystery.\nSince they are not two through kalpas,\nthey are called \"the same.\"\n\nIt is also said: This too is inadmissible.\n\nThe great Dao embodies truth;\nit has never not been the Dao.\nSentient beings embody illusion;\nthey have never not changed.\n\nThrough kalpas and distant realms,\nthey are called different.\n\nThe great person grasps the mysterious root,\nresponding to things without mind, yet penetrating.\nTo know the penetration of the great Dao\nis called the great person.\n\nThough the great Dao differs,\nthere is nothing that is not great—\nthus it is called the mysterious root.\n\nThe great Dao follows the mysterious and quiescent.\nThose who still the mind—\nthis is called quiescence.\nThose who do not still it—\nthis is called non-quiescence.\n\nClearly knowing that within one place,\nthere is quiescence and non-quiescence;\nthose who arouse the mind—\nthis is quiescence and non-quiescence;\nthose who do not arouse it—\nthere is no quiescence and no non-quiescence.\n\nThese four phrases—\nthe great Dao is within them.\n\nIt is also said:\nActivity is movement,\nnon-activity is quiescence.\nOnly when stirred does it move;\nwithout stirring, it is naturally quiescent.\n\nOnly in movement is there quiescence,\nonly in quiescence is there movement.\nSimply take movement—\nmovement within quiescence;\nsimply take quiescence—\nquiescence like movement.\n\nThough movement and quiescence differ,\ntrue nature emerges from one.\nThough true nature is one,\nit is not bound to movement or quiescence.\nThough movement and quiescence are two,\ntrue nature is not bound—\nthis is like mud and seal.\n\nIf one brings the quiescent mind to movement,\nthough moving, the mind remains constantly quiescent;\nif one brings the moving mind to quiescence,\nthough quiescent, it remains constantly moving.\n\nTo always have stability is to break the prior;\nto always have the prior is to break stability.\n\nWhen opposed, they alternately conceal and reveal;\nwhen united, concentration and wisdom are both complete.\n\nWithin one mind and one thought,\nall perfectly unites past and present.\n\nThus, one thought and one movement\nare neither short nor long;\none speck of dust, one world—\nneither large nor small.\n\nTherefore, the sage in the present\ncan speak of ancient matters—\nall by tracing texts in reverse to attain their truth.\n\nThus, present texts speak of ancient matters:\nwhat was in the past can be practiced,\nwhat was not in the past cannot be practiced.\nHence it is said:\nThe Jade Calendar emerges into the world,\nencompassing and returning all principles.\n\nQuestion: How can today’s mind\nthink of ancient matters?\nHow can ancient matters\nbe said to reside in today’s thoughts?\n\nIf ancient matters are in the present,\nthen the past is known to be not past;\nif today’s mind is in the past,\nthen the future is known to be already come.\n\nIf one says the future is fixed,\nhow can the present know the past?\nIf one says the past is fixed,\nhow can the past truly remain in the present?\n\nSince today’s mind thinks of ancient matters,\nand ancient matters are tied to today’s mind—\nclearly, within one mind and one thought,\nit contains the past and also contains the present.\n\nBecause of this past and present,\none mind cannot be obtained;\nbecause of this one mind,\ntwo minds cannot be obtained.\n\nThus, it is neither one nor two,\ncan be one and can be two,\nis being and is non-being,\nhas no non-being and no being.\n\nBecause it is being,\ntake being to traverse it;\nbecause it is non-being,\ntake non-being to traverse it.\n\nAbandon non-being and enter the Dao—\ntake being to traverse it;\nabandon being and emerge into the world—\nworldly dharmas arise and perish;\nabandon the world and enter the Dao—\nthe nature of the Dao has no arising or perishing,\npast and present appear boundlessly.\n\nHence it is said:\nVastly, all defilements are purified,\npenetratingly, one reaches the Great Clarity.\nThe world is not a permanent abode—\nthe mysterious capital is the old capital.\n\nQuestion: Within a single thread, are there five notes?\n\nAnswer: There is the nature of the five notes.\nWhen the silk is not yet made into a string,\nthere are no five notes within the silk,\nnor is there nature within it,\nnor any interconnection of forms.\n\nWhen the silk becomes a string,\nplucking it produces the form of sound;\nwhen not plucked, the nature of sound remains—\nthese two existences interconnect.\n\nThus it is known that within a single thread,\nthere is being and there is non-being;\nits inherent nature\nis neither being nor non-being.\n\nIf one seeks to break being,\nthe nature of sound within the silk is not being;\nif one seeks to break non-being,\nthe nature of sound within the silk is not non-being.\nSince it is neither being nor non-being,\nit cannot be broken.\n\nQuestion: The silk has no sound, yet plucking it produces sound;\nthe cart has no ox, yet whipping it makes it move—\nhow are these two non-beings the same?\nThe silk has nature, and its nature is eternally present;\nthe silk has sound, yet sound arises and ceases—\nhow are these two beings the same?\n\nAnswer: Each has its two beings and two non-beings,\nmutually dependent and interconnected,\nthus being and non-being are each the same as defilements.\nWhen sentient beings cultivate and attain the sage’s Way,\nthey see that at the moment of attaining the Way, there are no defilements.\nYet when one examines the moment of attaining the Way,\nwhere do defilements reside?\nFrom whom is the Way obtained?\n\nIt is also said:\nObserve carefully—\ndefilements have no place to hide,\nyet there are no defilements.\nClearly knowing defilements are extinguished,\nthe Way has no other source;\nyet those who attain the Way\nclearly know the Way arises.\n\nIf one accepts this as fixed,\nall are subject to arising and ceasing.\nThe Way is not superior,\nnor are defilements inferior—\nwhy then苦苦 seek to extinguish defilements\nand strive to reach the Way’s ground,\nwhen the Way and defilements ultimately leave no remainder?\n\nFurther answer: Speaking of the Way and the self,\nthe essence of the Way is fundamentally thus—\nup to now, it has never given rise to defilements.\n\nFurther answer: Ultimately thus,\nup to now, it has never been extinguished—\nwhy then speak of the Way and defilements,\nfalsely claiming arising and ceasing?\n\nWhat is this?\nCarefully observing these four,\nthey are ultimately unassailable,\nfor within this Dharma,\nthere is no remainder and no lack.\nIf one claims the four are eternal,\nthey do not pervade the Dharma;\nif one speaks of the one and the infinite,\nit is clear they do not encompass all.\n\nIf one claims they can encompass all,\nthen the four are not real.\nHow then to understand this?\n\nAnswer: The four are mutually contradictory,\narising and ceasing do not occur simultaneously.\nDwelling in one, the other three are negated;\ndwelling in two, there is no fear.\nApplying one to all—\nwhy would multiplicity not be the Way?\nThere is one, and there is many;\nthus there can be one and there can be infinite.\nThus there can be being and there can be non-being;\nthus there can be constancy and there can be cessation;\nthere can be superiority and there can be inferiority.\n\nIn the true nature of the Great Way,\nthere is no superiority nor inferiority,\nno being nor non-being—\nwhom then does arising and ceasing expel?\nSince nothing arises or ceases,\nit is said that the Way’s ground and defilements\nultimately leave no remainder.\n\nWhen practitioners walk the Way,\nthey should uphold the correct mind,\nwithout losing the true nature.\n\nQuestion: Whose nature is this nature?\nWhose mind is this mind?\n\nAnswer: It is still the four propositions.\nThe mind is also the nature of all dharmas.\nWithout the four propositions, there is no mind;\nwithout all dharmas, there is no nature.\nIf there is being, it exists simultaneously,\npervading the Dharma-realm without limit;\nif there is non-being, it ceases simultaneously,\nfearing even the most subtle would be utterly exhausted.\n\nHere, there is nothing to be said—\nit is forcibly named the Great Way.\nThe supreme Way is eternally mysterious and still;\nspeech is not its truth.\nYet to transform sentient beings,\nit is forcibly spoken of.\n\nSpeaking of the four propositions,\nthe Way responds accordingly—\nonce the response arises,\nit becomes the four illnesses.\nYet the arising of propositions\ndoes not occur simultaneously:\nresponding to one, the other three are negated.\nSometimes the first arises while the other three have not yet come;\nsometimes the last arises while the other three have already departed.\n\nYet the arising of one\ndepends on the three—\nwhen these three are negated,\none also does not stand alone.\nAt the very moment of one,\nthe three have long been forgotten;\nwhen the three are forgotten, one is also forgotten.\n\nQuestion: Why does the Way arise in speech only to be negated?\n\nAnswer: Because sentient beings have arising and ceasing,\nthus arising is negated by ceasing,\nand ceasing is negated by arising.\nIn the true nature of the Great Way,\nthere is no nature and no cessation.\n\nDwelling in this ground and speaking of the four propositions,\nthey are called the four propositions.\nWhen the mind abides here,\nthere are originally no four propositions.\nSince the four propositions are absent,\nthe mind is also absent—\nonly then is it called the Great Four Propositions:\nmind, Great Way, true nature, and true reality thus.\n\nQuestion: Earlier it was said that dwelling in one negates the three,\nand arising in four negates the three—\nwhy not arise in just one?\nIf one has superiority and inferiority,\nwhy not select the essential?\nIf one has no superiority or inferiority,\nwhy traverse the three?\n\nMoreover:\nIf one word suffices,\nthere is no need to arise in three;\nif four words suffice,\nthese three should not be negated.\nWhy arise in four only to negate three?\nWhy traverse three to retain one?\n\nAnswer: Among the four propositions, there is no superiority or inferiority.\nSince sentient beings have not awakened,\none word is insufficient,\nthus four words are provisionally employed.\nThe four propositions do not occur simultaneously—\ntraversing one, the other three are always negated;\nwhen the three are negated, one is also negated—\nhow could it be limited to three?\n\nQuestion: These four propositions are the true Dharma of arising and ceasing—\nwhy does the Way dwell within them?\n\nAnswer: The Way is nowhere absent,\neternally present in the four propositions.\nWherever it dwells is non-being—\nthe four propositions are not the Way.\n\nFurther question: The four propositions contain being—\nwhy must being arise from being?\nThe four propositions contain non-being—\nwhy must non-being extinguish non-being?\n\nAnswer: Within the four propositions, there is being,\nyet arising cannot be obtained;\nwithin the four propositions, there is non-being,\nyet extinction cannot be obtained.\nThis is natural arising,\nthis is natural ceasing—\nnot arising from one who arises,\nnot ceasing from one who ceases.\nHere, there is only thusness,\nnot arising nor ceasing,\nnor not-arising nor not-ceasing.\n\nYet these four propositions have been spoken of before,\nthus though negated, they do not equate to the time before speech.\nThus the awakened abide in the world having once awakened.\n\nThus, though returning, it does not equate to the unenlightened.\nOnce true nature is attained, it is never stained by the mundane—\nhence it is said: the singular nature does not alter.\n\nAll myriad things each possess the four propositions.\nWithin the four propositions, each has its mind.\nMind after mind is not distinct—\npervading them as one, thus it is named the Great One.\nIt may also merge obscurely into one.\nSeeking mind through the four propositions,\none finds that mind is but the outer skin—\neven to the point where neither skin nor mind remains,\nthis is called the Great One.\n\nIt is likened to the plantain:\npeeling away its layers to seek the heart,\none finds that the heart is but another layer—\npeeling until neither layer nor heart remains,\nthis is called the True One.\n\nThus it is said: the nearer one approaches, the farther from reality.\nIf one attains the boundless, the non-other reality,\nthis is called the True One.\n\nSeeing without seeing, seeing the formless—\nfor where there is no form, there is no seeing;\nso too with no-thought.\nGuarding the one breaks the knowledge of one.\nThough guarding, it merges with sleep—\nas when one concentrates intently,\neyes closed to envision, eyes open to retain,\nthus obtaining the use of inner and outer.\n\nThe Way has never been four,\nfor its nature is one;\nthe Way has never been one,\nfor it pervades the four things.\nBoth one and four,\nneither one nor four—\nwhen the true reality arises from their midst,\nit is named the True One.\nThe True One is but a borrowed term.\nOnly because the Dharma does not speak\ndo we see the spoken Dharma.\nIf the Dharma were spoken,\nwe would again see the unspoken Dharma—\ndistant yet mutually dependent,\neach revealing the other.\nWithin them lies hidden measure,\nfore and aft in accord.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nif this is not,\nthere is no hidden measure;\nfrom ancient times to the present,\nif this is,\nthere is hidden measure.\nThus we know being and non-being oppose,\npast and present differ in age—\nonly in the symbol’s central truth,\nthe one and four images,\ndo they converge in true nature,\nnaturally so.\n\nWhat transformation awaits its cause to change?\nThough grasses and trees lack knowledge,\ntheir falling fruit meets birth and death;\nthough the true Way lacks knowledge,\nits falling fruit is ever-abiding.\nHere, though lacking knowledge,\nthere is the perception of non-knowledge.\nWithout mind, there is no knowing;\nwithout eye, there is no seeing.\nThis knowing is not mind—\nthus it knows the unknowable;\nthis seeing is not eye—\nthus it sees the unseeable.\nHence it is said: to know the unknowable\nis the pivot of the Way.\n\nKnow that within the three times,\nall three are empty.\nThe three times are:\none half already gone,\none half yet to come,\nwith no interval remaining between—\nthus all are empty.\n\nUnderstanding the emptiness of the three times\nis like a lamp.\nWhen about to extinguish the lamp,\ndoes one see the lamp at the moment of extinction?\nIf at extinction the lamp is seen,\nthen extinction has not yet come;\nif at extinction the lamp is not seen,\nthen the lamp has already passed;\nbetween extinction and non-extinction,\nwhere does its nature stand?\nBetween past and future,\nthere is but a name without substance—\nthus we know the three times are empty.\n\nEmpty, therefore without self;\nwithout self, what love remains?\nHaving no attachment,\nit is one with the Way.\nOne with the emptiness of the Way—\nthus it is called love of the Way.\nEmpty yet one with self—\nthus it is called the Way’s love.\nThe essence of the Way is truly empty,\nyet not identical to emptiness.\nEmptiness can only empty,\nit cannot respond to things;\nthe essence of the Way, though empty,\ncan empty and respond to things.\n\nQuestion: Can the Way respond to things—\ncan things attain the Way?\nIf things attain the Way,\nshould they not abide upon attaining it?\nWhy then do they receive further birth?\nIf things are not the Way,\nwhat is cultivated is but an external path.\nThings can never attain the Way,\nso why employ cultivation?\n\nAnswer: Because sentient beings are impermanent,\nthey must rely on cultivation.\nThe Way is impermanent—\nwhen sentient beings cultivate, they attain it.\nSentient beings do not attain it by themselves,\nbut through the Way they first attain.\nThe name of the Way does not arise by itself,\nbut through sentient beings it arises.\nWhen it arises, it arises all at once—\nnothing fails to arise;\nwhen forgotten, it is forgotten all at once—\nnothing fails to be forgotten.\nSuperior and inferior arise simultaneously—\nwhere then are Way and things?\n\nThough sentient beings arise, the Way does not arise;\nthough sentient beings cease, the Way does not cease.\nWhen sentient beings arise, the Way first arises;\nwhen sentient beings cease, the Way also ceases.\nIf one allows for selflessness,\nthen from the beginning the Way was attained, not I;\nif one insists on self,\nthen from the beginning the Way was attained, not I.\n\nBefore sentient beings arose, the Way was already present—\nthis Way is not my Way,\nit is solely the ancient Way.\nThe Way I now attain\nmeets the essence of the ancient Way—\nthus the ancient Way is the present Way,\nthe present Way is my Way.\nWhy?\nThrough kalpas without end,\nonly the one Way of wisdom exists.\nWhen attained by sentient beings,\nit is the private Way of sentient beings—\nmerely the floating Way of the many,\nresponding to the private and named the private Way.\n\nTo break names:\npointing to bamboo as water,\npointing to emptiness as bamboo—\nthus at one moment it is,\nat another it is not.\nTo break essence:\nfollowing the transformations of sentient beings’ perceptions,\none sees being and non-being differently.\nSometimes seeing emptiness where there is being,\nsometimes seeing being where there is emptiness—\nthis is breaking essence.\n\nObserving names and dharmas as existent,\nsometimes they merely change without emptying—\nas when seeing an ox change into a horse,\none says it is a horse,\nnot an ox,\nyet it is not replacing the other in name.\nIf one person attains pure perception,\nall dharmas are also pure;\nif the multitude do not attain it,\nall dharmas are also defiled.\nClearly knowing it is still defiled,\nthe pure is pure again,\nthe defiled is also being,\nthe formless is also the absence of dharmas.\n\nThe essence of perception is eternal and pure;\nits function is change and sentient beings.\nSentient beings cultivate change to seek the unchanging,\ncultivate function to return to essence—\nthis is the death of the perceptual function,\nnot the death of the pure true essence.\n\nAbiding in fundamental reality,\nnot receiving empty names—\nwhen empty names come,\neach returns to its emptiness.\nIf reality comes to take,\nI receive the one;\nif emptiness comes to take,\nI receive the two;\nif one comes without speech,\nabiding in reality, only the one is obtained.",

      "translated_text": "Then it is wondrously clear!\n\nWhen the mind faces objects, mind and objects arise together;\nif objects do not disturb the mind, it is the mind that deludedly arises.\nThe mind does not arise of itself—it arises because of objects.\nWithout the mind, objects do not arise of themselves;\nwithout objects, the mind also does not arise of itself.\n\nWhat can be spoken of is the provisional Dao;\nthe constant Dao is the true Dao.\nIf one abides in these,\nthis constant will indeed become provisional.\n\nWhy?\nThe constant alone abides in constancy and does not pervade the provisional,\nthus this constant faces the provisional,\nand so its constancy becomes provisional.\n\nUtterances arise and emerge into the world—\nspeaking of constancy is also speaking of the provisional.\nSince constancy and provisionality are originally nonexistent,\nthere is also no non-constancy or non-provisionality.\n\nIf among the manifold words,\none observes their subtleties through speech,\nif one awakens to the emptiness of manifold words,\none observes their wonder without desire.\n\nSubstance and function are not the same—\nwhy?\nSubstance is not function,\nfunction is not substance.\n\nObserve carefully:\nwhen substance moves, it becomes function,\nand that function is indeed substance;\nwhen function ceases and returns to substance,\nthat substance is function.\n\nPreserve them, and there are four;\nforget them, and there is not one.\n\nAmong the inexhaustible dharmas under heaven,\nnone surpass being and non-being.\nWithin all being and non-being,\nnone surpass constancy and annihilation.\n\nWhat is born does not exceed the four kinds of birth;\nwhere birth resides does not exceed the great Dao.\n\nNot only is the provisional Dao provisional,\nthe constant Dao is also provisional;\nnot only is the constant Dao constant,\nthe provisional Dao is also constant.\n\nAll arise through mutual dependence,\nyet their arising is no arising;\nthey also perish through mutual dependence,\nyet their perishing is no perishing.\n\nViews of emptiness and views of existence\nboth reside within the one mind.\nIf this mind is also nonexistent,\nwhere then would views of emptiness and existence reside?\n\nAll mental states and their meanings\nare likewise so.\n\nTherefore, when the mind arises, all dharmas arise;\nwhen the mind ceases, all dharmas cease.\nIf one realizes the mindless,\nthere is certainly no arising, nor any ceasing.\n\nIn the constant, there are four truths:\none is constant, two are not.\nTo equalize them is to fall into the one;\nwithout equalization, the one is not seen.\nThe Dao is both equalization and non-equalization.\n\nAbandon sageliness and discard wisdom,\nfrom the ordinary attain sageliness—\nthis sageliness still faces the ordinary.\nWhen one is in the ordinary,\nit has long since departed with the ordinary;\nsince the ordinary has departed, sageliness also departs.\n\nWhen both ordinary and sagely are forgotten,\nthere is no wisdom and no benevolence,\nfew desires and return to the Dao.\n\nQuestion: If abandoning sageliness has led to sageliness,\nmay one be permitted to abandon it?\nFor one who has not yet attained sageliness,\nhow should one dispel the abandonment?\n\nAnswer: We speak only of one who has attained sageliness,\nnot of one who has not.\nOne who has not attained has no sageliness—\nhow can one speak of no-sageliness?\n\nThe great Dao responds to nature,\nyet this nature is not visible.\nThe natures of foolish and wise beings—\nboth natures are not visible.\n\nBecause they are not visible,\nthey can unite with the utmost mystery.\nSince they are not two through kalpas,\nthey are called \"the same.\"\n\nIt is also said: This too is inadmissible.\n\nThe great Dao embodies truth;\nit has never not been the Dao.\nSentient beings embody illusion;\nthey have never not changed.\n\nThrough kalpas and distant realms,\nthey are called different.\n\nThe great person grasps the mysterious root,\nresponding to things without mind, yet penetrating.\nTo know the penetration of the great Dao\nis called the great person.\n\nThough the great Dao differs,\nthere is nothing that is not great—\nthus it is called the mysterious root.\n\nThe great Dao follows the mysterious and quiescent.\nThose who still the mind—\nthis is called quiescence.\nThose who do not still it—\nthis is called non-quiescence.\n\nClearly knowing that within one place,\nthere is quiescence and non-quiescence;\nthose who arouse the mind—\nthis is quiescence and non-quiescence;\nthose who do not arouse it—\nthere is no quiescence and no non-quiescence.\n\nThese four phrases—\nthe great Dao is within them.\n\nIt is also said:\nActivity is movement,\nnon-activity is quiescence.\nOnly when stirred does it move;\nwithout stirring, it is naturally quiescent.\n\nOnly in movement is there quiescence,\nonly in quiescence is there movement.\nSimply take movement—\nmovement within quiescence;\nsimply take quiescence—\nquiescence like movement.\n\nThough movement and quiescence differ,\ntrue nature emerges from one.\nThough true nature is one,\nit is not bound to movement or quiescence.\nThough movement and quiescence are two,\ntrue nature is not bound—\nthis is like mud and seal.\n\nIf one brings the quiescent mind to movement,\nthough moving, the mind remains constantly quiescent;\nif one brings the moving mind to quiescence,\nthough quiescent, it remains constantly moving.\n\nTo always have stability is to break the prior;\nto always have the prior is to break stability.\n\nWhen opposed, they alternately conceal and reveal;\nwhen united, concentration and wisdom are both complete.\n\nWithin one mind and one thought,\nall perfectly unites past and present.\n\nThus, one thought and one movement\nare neither short nor long;\none speck of dust, one world—\nneither large nor small.\n\nTherefore, the sage in the present\ncan speak of ancient matters—\nall by tracing texts in reverse to attain their truth.\n\nThus, present texts speak of ancient matters:\nwhat was in the past can be practiced,\nwhat was not in the past cannot be practiced.\nHence it is said:\nThe Jade Calendar emerges into the world,\nencompassing and returning all principles.\n\nQuestion: How can today’s mind\nthink of ancient matters?\nHow can ancient matters\nbe said to reside in today’s thoughts?\n\nIf ancient matters are in the present,\nthen the past is known to be not past;\nif today’s mind is in the past,\nthen the future is known to be already come.\n\nIf one says the future is fixed,\nhow can the present know the past?\nIf one says the past is fixed,\nhow can the past truly remain in the present?\n\nSince today’s mind thinks of ancient matters,\nand ancient matters are tied to today’s mind—\nclearly, within one mind and one thought,\nit contains the past and also contains the present.\n\nBecause of this past and present,\none mind cannot be obtained;\nbecause of this one mind,\ntwo minds cannot be obtained.\n\nThus, it is neither one nor two,\ncan be one and can be two,\nis being and is non-being,\nhas no non-being and no being.\n\nBecause it is being,\ntake being to traverse it;\nbecause it is non-being,\ntake non-being to traverse it.\n\nAbandon non-being and enter the Dao—\ntake being to traverse it;\nabandon being and emerge into the world—\nworldly dharmas arise and perish;\nabandon the world and enter the Dao—\nthe nature of the Dao has no arising or perishing,\npast and present appear boundlessly.\n\nHence it is said:\nVastly, all defilements are purified,\npenetratingly, one reaches the Great Clarity.\nThe world is not a permanent abode—\nthe mysterious capital is the old capital.\n\nQuestion: Within a single thread, are there five notes?",

      "translated_text": "Answer: There is the nature of the five notes.\nWhen the silk is not yet made into a string,\nthere are no five notes within the silk,\nnor is there nature within it,\nnor any interconnection of forms.\n\nWhen the silk becomes a string,\nplucking it produces the form of sound;\nwhen not plucked, the nature of sound remains—\nthese two existences interconnect.\n\nThus it is known that within a single thread,\nthere is being and there is non-being;\nits inherent nature\nis neither being nor non-being.\n\nIf one seeks to break being,\nthe nature of sound within the silk is not being;\nif one seeks to break non-being,\nthe nature of sound within the silk is not non-being.\nSince it is neither being nor non-being,\nit cannot be broken.\n\nQuestion: The silk has no sound, yet plucking it produces sound;\nthe cart has no ox, yet whipping it makes it move—\nhow are these two non-beings the same?\nThe silk has nature, and its nature is eternally present;\nthe silk has sound, yet sound arises and ceases—\nhow are these two beings the same?\n\nAnswer: Each has its two beings and two non-beings,\nmutually dependent and interconnected,\nthus being and non-being are each the same as defilements.\nWhen sentient beings cultivate and attain the sage’s Way,\nthey see that at the moment of attaining the Way, there are no defilements.\nYet when one examines the moment of attaining the Way,\nwhere do defilements reside?\nFrom whom is the Way obtained?\n\nIt is also said:\nObserve carefully—\ndefilements have no place to hide,\nyet there are no defilements.\nClearly knowing defilements are extinguished,\nthe Way has no other source;\nyet those who attain the Way\nclearly know the Way arises.\n\nIf one accepts this as fixed,\nall are subject to arising and ceasing.\nThe Way is not superior,\nnor are defilements inferior—\nwhy then苦苦 seek to extinguish defilements\nand strive to reach the Way’s ground,\nwhen the Way and defilements ultimately leave no remainder?\n\nFurther answer: Speaking of the Way and the self,\nthe essence of the Way is fundamentally thus—\nup to now, it has never given rise to defilements.\n\nFurther answer: Ultimately thus,\nup to now, it has never been extinguished—\nwhy then speak of the Way and defilements,\nfalsely claiming arising and ceasing?\n\nWhat is this?\nCarefully observing these four,\nthey are ultimately unassailable,\nfor within this Dharma,\nthere is no remainder and no lack.\nIf one claims the four are eternal,\nthey do not pervade the Dharma;\nif one speaks of the one and the infinite,\nit is clear they do not encompass all.\n\nIf one claims they can encompass all,\nthen the four are not real.\nHow then to understand this?\n\nAnswer: The four are mutually contradictory,\narising and ceasing do not occur simultaneously.\nDwelling in one, the other three are negated;\ndwelling in two, there is no fear.\nApplying one to all—\nwhy would multiplicity not be the Way?\nThere is one, and there is many;\nthus there can be one and there can be infinite.\nThus there can be being and there can be non-being;\nthus there can be constancy and there can be cessation;\nthere can be superiority and there can be inferiority.\n\nIn the true nature of the Great Way,\nthere is no superiority nor inferiority,\nno being nor non-being—\nwhom then does arising and ceasing expel?\nSince nothing arises or ceases,\nit is said that the Way’s ground and defilements\nultimately leave no remainder.\n\nWhen practitioners walk the Way,\nthey should uphold the correct mind,\nwithout losing the true nature.\n\nQuestion: Whose nature is this nature?\nWhose mind is this mind?\n\nAnswer: It is still the four propositions.\nThe mind is also the nature of all dharmas.\nWithout the four propositions, there is no mind;\nwithout all dharmas, there is no nature.\nIf there is being, it exists simultaneously,\npervading the Dharma-realm without limit;\nif there is non-being, it ceases simultaneously,\nfearing even the most subtle would be utterly exhausted.\n\nHere, there is nothing to be said—\nit is forcibly named the Great Way.\nThe supreme Way is eternally mysterious and still;\nspeech is not its truth.\nYet to transform sentient beings,\nit is forcibly spoken of.\n\nSpeaking of the four propositions,\nthe Way responds accordingly—\nonce the response arises,\nit becomes the four illnesses.\nYet the arising of propositions\ndoes not occur simultaneously:\nresponding to one, the other three are negated.\nSometimes the first arises while the other three have not yet come;\nsometimes the last arises while the other three have already departed.\n\nYet the arising of one\ndepends on the three—\nwhen these three are negated,\none also does not stand alone.\nAt the very moment of one,\nthe three have long been forgotten;\nwhen the three are forgotten, one is also forgotten.\n\nQuestion: Why does the Way arise in speech only to be negated?\n\nAnswer: Because sentient beings have arising and ceasing,\nthus arising is negated by ceasing,\nand ceasing is negated by arising.\nIn the true nature of the Great Way,\nthere is no nature and no cessation.\n\nDwelling in this ground and speaking of the four propositions,\nthey are called the four propositions.\nWhen the mind abides here,\nthere are originally no four propositions.\nSince the four propositions are absent,\nthe mind is also absent—\nonly then is it called the Great Four Propositions:\nmind, Great Way, true nature, and true reality thus.\n\nQuestion: Earlier it was said that dwelling in one negates the three,\nand arising in four negates the three—\nwhy not arise in just one?\nIf one has superiority and inferiority,\nwhy not select the essential?\nIf one has no superiority or inferiority,\nwhy traverse the three?\n\nMoreover:\nIf one word suffices,\nthere is no need to arise in three;\nif four words suffice,\nthese three should not be negated.\nWhy arise in four only to negate three?\nWhy traverse three to retain one?\n\nAnswer: Among the four propositions, there is no superiority or inferiority.\nSince sentient beings have not awakened,\none word is insufficient,\nthus four words are provisionally employed.\nThe four propositions do not occur simultaneously—\ntraversing one, the other three are always negated;\nwhen the three are negated, one is also negated—\nhow could it be limited to three?\n\nQuestion: These four propositions are the true Dharma of arising and ceasing—\nwhy does the Way dwell within them?\n\nAnswer: The Way is nowhere absent,\neternally present in the four propositions.\nWherever it dwells is non-being—\nthe four propositions are not the Way.\n\nFurther question: The four propositions contain being—\nwhy must being arise from being?\nThe four propositions contain non-being—\nwhy must non-being extinguish non-being?\n\nAnswer: Within the four propositions, there is being,\nyet arising cannot be obtained;\nwithin the four propositions, there is non-being,\nyet extinction cannot be obtained.\nThis is natural arising,\nthis is natural ceasing—\nnot arising from one who arises,\nnot ceasing from one who ceases.\nHere, there is only thusness,\nnot arising nor ceasing,\nnor not-arising nor not-ceasing.\n\nYet these four propositions have been spoken of before,\nthus though negated, they do not equate to the time before speech.\nThus the awakened abide in the world having once awakened.",

remains,\nthis is called the Great One.\n\nIt is likened to the plantain:\npeeling away its layers to seek the heart,\none finds that the heart is but another layer—\npeeling until neither layer nor heart remains,\nthis is called the True One.\n\nThus it is said: the nearer one approaches, the farther from reality.\nIf one attains the boundless, the non-other reality,\nthis is called the True One.\n\nSeeing without seeing, seeing the formless—\nfor where there is no form, there is no seeing;\nso too with no-thought.\nGuarding the one breaks the knowledge of one.\nThough guarding, it merges with sleep—\nas when one concentrates intently,\neyes closed to envision, eyes open to retain,\nthus obtaining the use of inner and outer.\n\nThe Way has never been four,\nfor its nature is one;\nthe Way has never been one,\nfor it pervades the four things.\nBoth one and four,\nneither one nor four—\nwhen the true reality arises from their midst,\nit is named the True One.\nThe True One is but a borrowed term.\nOnly because the Dharma does not speak\ndo we see the spoken Dharma.\nIf the Dharma were spoken,\nwe would again see the unspoken Dharma—\ndistant yet mutually dependent,\neach revealing the other.\nWithin them lies hidden measure,\nfore and aft in accord.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nif this is not,\nthere is no hidden measure;\nfrom ancient times to the present,\nif this is,\nthere is hidden measure.\nThus we know being and non-being oppose,\npast and present differ in age—\nonly in the symbol’s central truth,\nthe one and four images,\ndo they converge in true nature,\nnaturally so.\n\nWhat transformation awaits its cause to change?\nThough grasses and trees lack knowledge,\ntheir falling fruit meets birth and death;\nthough the true Way lacks knowledge,\nits falling fruit is ever-abiding.\nHere, though lacking knowledge,\nthere is the perception of non-knowledge.\nWithout mind, there is no knowing;\nwithout eye, there is no seeing.\nThis knowing is not mind—\nthus it knows the unknowable;\nthis seeing is not eye—\nthus it sees the unseeable.\nHence it is said: to know the unknowable\nis the pivot of the Way.\n\nKnow that within the three times,\nall three are empty.\nThe three times are:\none half already gone,\none half yet to come,\nwith no interval remaining between—\nthus all are empty.\n\nUnderstanding the emptiness of the three times\nis like a lamp.\nWhen about to extinguish the lamp,\ndoes one see the lamp at the moment of extinction?\nIf at extinction the lamp is seen,\nthen extinction has not yet come;\nif at extinction the lamp is not seen,\nthen the lamp has already passed;\nbetween extinction and non-extinction,\nwhere does its nature stand?\nBetween past and future,\nthere is but a name without substance—\nthus we know the three times are empty.\n\nEmpty, therefore without self;\nwithout self, what love remains?\nHaving no attachment,\nit is one with the Way.\nOne with the emptiness of the Way—\nthus it is called love of the Way.\nEmpty yet one with self—\nthus it is called the Way’s love.\nThe essence of the Way is truly empty,\nyet not identical to emptiness.\nEmptiness can only empty,\nit cannot respond to things;\nthe essence of the Way, though empty,\ncan empty and respond to things.\n\nQuestion: Can the Way respond to things—\ncan things attain the Way?\nIf things attain the Way,\nshould they not abide upon attaining it?\nWhy then do they receive further birth?\nIf things are not the Way,\nwhat is cultivated is but an external path.\nThings can never attain the Way,\nso why employ cultivation?\n\nAnswer: Because sentient beings are impermanent,\nthey must rely on cultivation.\nThe Way is impermanent—\nwhen sentient beings cultivate, they attain it.\nSentient beings do not attain it by themselves,\nbut through the Way they first attain.\nThe name of the Way does not arise by itself,\nbut through sentient beings it arises.\nWhen it arises, it arises all at once—\nnothing fails to arise;\nwhen forgotten, it is forgotten all at once—\nnothing fails to be forgotten.\nSuperior and inferior arise simultaneously—\nwhere then are Way and things?\n\nThough sentient beings arise, the Way does not arise;\nthough sentient beings cease, the Way does not cease.\nWhen sentient beings arise, the Way first arises;\nwhen sentient beings cease, the Way also ceases.\nIf one allows for selflessness,\nthen from the beginning the Way was attained, not I;\nif one insists on self,\nthen from the beginning the Way was attained, not I.\n\nBefore sentient beings arose, the Way was already present—\nthis Way is not my Way,\nit is solely the ancient Way.\nThe Way I now attain\nmeets the essence of the ancient Way—\nthus the ancient Way is the present Way,\nthe present Way is my Way.\nWhy?\nThrough kalpas without end,\nonly the one Way of wisdom exists.\nWhen attained by sentient beings,\nit is the private Way of sentient beings—\nmerely the floating Way of the many,\nresponding to the private and named the private Way.\n\nTo break names:\npointing to bamboo as water,\npointing to emptiness as bamboo—\nthus at one moment it is,\nat another it is not.\nTo break essence:\nfollowing the transformations of sentient beings’ perceptions,\none sees being and non-being differently.\nSometimes seeing emptiness where there is being,\nsometimes seeing being where there is emptiness—\nthis is breaking essence.\n\nObserving names and dharmas as existent,\nsometimes they merely change without emptying—\nas when seeing an ox change into a horse,\none says it is a horse,\nnot an ox,\nyet it is not replacing the other in name.\nIf one person attains pure perception,\nall dharmas are also pure;\nif the multitude do not attain it,\nall dharmas are also defiled.\nClearly knowing it is still defiled,\nthe pure is pure again,\nthe defiled is also being,\nthe formless is also the absence of dharmas.\n\nThe essence of perception is eternal and pure;\nits function is change and sentient beings.\nSentient beings cultivate change to seek the unchanging,\ncultivate function to return to essence—\nthis is the death of the perceptual function,\nnot the death of the pure true essence.\n\nAbiding in fundamental reality,\nnot receiving empty names—\nwhen empty names come,\neach returns to its emptiness.\nIf reality comes to take,\nI receive the one;\nif emptiness comes to take,\nI receive the two;\nif one comes without speech,\nabiding in reality, only the one is obtained.",
      "overlap_context": " arising cannot be obtained;\nwithin the four propositions, there is non-being,\nyet extinction cannot be obtained.\nThis is natural arising,\nthis is natural ceasing—\nnot arising from one who arises,\nnot ceasing from one who ceases.\nHere, there is only thusness,\nnot arising nor ceasing,\nnor not-arising nor not-ceasing.\n\nYet these four propositions have been spoken of before,\nthus though negated, they do not equate to the time before speech.\nThus the awakened abide in the world having once awakened.",
