  "full_translation": "**The Stages of Superior Elixir Practice: Refining the Self and Cultivating Sincerity as the First Step**\n\nI have often observed that amidst the red dust of the world, all is bustle and confusion—most are drowned in the pursuit of profit and desire, either shackled to fame and career or idly squandering their years, unaware of how to return to their original nature. Though some, blessed with wisdom from past lives, seek the Great Dao, their karmic conditions may not align, and they encounter mediocre guides who lead them astray onto crooked paths, never to awaken in their lifetimes. Thus has the Supreme Dao remained obscured in the world for so long!\n\nBy virtue of good affinities from past lives, I was fortunate to meet a true master and receive instruction in *The Stages of Superior Elixir Practice*. Having now verified its efficacy, I dare not keep it for myself. I must clear away the brambles, open the gate, and point the way to the broad and level path, so that seekers may follow step by step.\n\nIf there are those devoted to the Dao with sincere and unwavering faith, they must first diminish their cravings, reduce speech, lessen thoughts, moderate flavors, guard against cold and heat, and balance labor and rest—thereby cultivating a clear and luminous will. Only then may they hope to ascend to the ranks of immortality.\n\nThus, one must first cultivate sincerity to refine the self, purifying the acquired habits and stains to reveal the original true essence—this is what Confucius meant by \"overcoming the self and returning to propriety.\" If a practitioner can truly refine away the mundane heart and preserve only the true nature, then in all circumstances—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, engaging with affairs or responding to things, or in conduct and self-cultivation—they must sweep away the myriad delusive thoughts of the seven emotions and six desires. In moments of neither seeing nor hearing, they must silently examine and restrain their mind, guarding against the sudden arising and vanishing of thoughts. Gradually, they will reach a state of unknowing and unawareness, where they may seek the inherent flavor of the Dao. Then, all kinds of illusory and false imaginings will have no ground to arise—this is the foundational practice of \"vigilance in solitude.\"\n\nOnly when worldly entanglements cease, the spirit becomes gradually clear, and the body and mind are gathered and concealed in secrecy—returning to the central palace and ancestral aperture—should one no longer wander externally. Instead, focus the spirit and settle the thoughts, nurturing the innate spark of luminosity within. Remain constantly responsive yet tranquil, like the vastness of the cosmos—boundless and unobstructed. Only then may one delve into the inexhaustible sacred realm.\n\nThis stage of practice may take one or two years, or three or four years; the longer the accumulation, the better. Only after undergoing this refining process may one enter the circular cultivation and proceed to the next stage.\n\n**Min Yanglin’s Note:**\nRefining the self and cultivating sincerity are precisely the transmission of \"overcoming the self and returning to propriety.\" The original text’s explanations were vague and lacked practical methods, mistakenly claiming a distinction from Confucius’ meaning—this was surely an error. I have revised it faithfully according to my master’s instructions.\n\nThis stage of practice is specifically designed to nurture and open the mysterious aperture. Since practitioners vary in constitution and purity, the text provides the essential guidance: \"one or two years, or three or four years; the longer the accumulation, the better.\" The following eleven stages all adhere to the original compilation of my late master, with no errors in the revisions.\n\n**Foundation-Building and Elixir-Nurturing, Second Stage**\n\nHaving established prior practice, the scholar may now select a secluded site to construct a circular chamber, far removed from worldly distractions. There, they shall arrange the altars of the Eastern Florescence Sovereign Lord, the Upright Yang Sovereign Lord, the Pure Yang Sovereign Lord, the Sea-Toad Sovereign Lord, the Weighty Yang Sovereign Lord, Ancestor Zhang of Purple Yang, Ancestor Shi of Apricot Grove, Ancestor Xue of Dao Radiance, Ancestor Chen of Muddy Pellet, Ancestor Bai of Jade Toad, and the various patriarchs of the Northern Lineage. Alongside the scriptures and teachings of their own lineage, they shall offer perpetual lamps, incense, and sacrifices. Day by day, they gather and refine body and mind, converging spirit and qi into the Central Palace’s ancestral aperture, abiding by the method of \"embracing the primordial and guarding the One.\"\n\n**[Min Xiaogen’s Note:**\nStrictly speaking, the superior elixir method treats the body itself as the altar, crucible, and furnace. Here, however, the text prescribes entering a circular chamber and arranging offerings to the ancestors—this is instruction tailored for middling and lesser practitioners, guiding them from the boundless, formless, and soundless state of stillness toward the realm of \"neither nothingness nor non-nothingness.\" Should their focus waver, the visible altars may serve to awaken their resolve, preventing neglect and fostering unwavering sincerity. Those of the highest wisdom move in harmony with Heaven, ceaselessly striving forward—this is what is meant by *\"The Supreme Lord watches over you; dare you harbor divided intent?\"* **]**\n\nMan’s primordial nature is none other than the Golden Elixir, none other than the Great Dao, none other than the Positionless True Man. Yet the world does not understand what is being cultivated when one refines the Golden Elixir, and so in the end achieves nothing. How lamentable that none point the way, burying so many men of resolve! If one but knew that the primordial spirit of the Elixir Way is one’s own primordial nature—this thing that is inherently one’s own—then, borrowing the body’s prenatal qi to transmute and refine it into a purely yang body, how could there be any who cultivate without success? As Ancestral Master Wang said, *“The primordial nature is called the Golden Elixir; the four temporalities serve as furnace to refine it into a sphere.”*\n\nThe Central Palace and Ancestral Cavity are precisely what the Most High called the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The refinement of the Golden Elixir depends entirely on this cavity. This is what is meant by *“Guard the One, and all things are accomplished.”*\n\n**[Min Xiaogen’s Note:**\nStrictly speaking, the Central Palace and Ancestral Cavity are indeed the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Yet this “central” must be truly recognized—not taken as something with form or location, but as the mean that is neither partial nor impartial, neither excessive nor deficient. Thus it has no direction or place, neither inside nor outside. Whether called the Pearl, the Millet Grain, the Maṇi, the Śarīra, the Golden Elixir, or the Supreme Ultimate, all these borrowed names and aliases are obtained, planted, refined, perfected, liberated, and transformed within this center. Yet to open and enter this Central Palace, this Ancestral Cavity, depends entirely on the purity of self-mastery, cultivated to the point of spontaneity—attaining the state of utter emptiness and profound stillness—only then has one deeply entered the trap! Lose this emptiness and stillness, and one falls outside the cavity. Only by moving and resting with the moment, untainted by personal thought, does one everywhere accord with the Dao.\n\nNow, this single cavity is called “establishing harmony” in the Daoist tradition, while in Confucianism it is the boundary between humanity and animality, and in Buddhism the divide between Māra and Buddha—all hanging by a thread. Yet this Mysterious Cavity is yang on the left and yin on the right, hence called the Mysterious Female. How then does it differ from the Confucian human/animal or Buddhist Māra/Buddha? The reason is this: its yang is true yang, its yin true yin, both belonging to the prenatal, and so it may be collectively called the Mysterious Cavity.\n\nMaster Niwan said, *“When the mechanism moves, one enters the Mysterious; when the mechanism is still, one enters the Female.”* This is the supreme Dao of spontaneity. Yet the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* states that *“where the thought moves is the Mysterious Female.”* What is the meaning of this? From the perspective of observing movement within stillness, it is precisely what Confucianism and Buddhism call the boundary between humanity and animality, Māra and Buddha.\n\nAs for the *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, it says, *“Within the human body, seek nowhere else.”* Thus its main text states, *“This cavity is no ordinary cavity; Heaven and Earth together form it.”*\n\nMaster Niwan further said, *“This is a provisional method, yet without seeking here, there is no way to enter at all.”*\n\nWhy is this so? This single cavity is boundless in its vastness, yet infinitesimal in its subtlety—thus a grain of millet may contain the great chiliocosm and embrace the Three Powers. The teachings of Master Ziyang on \"attaining the body\" are precise and accessible indeed! Our ancestral Master Niwan’s compassionate instruction of the provisional method—how profound, how profound! The Three Powers all reside within the Mysterious Cavity; how could my body exist outside it? If my body is within the cavity, could the ancestral cavity of my body lie beyond the Mysterious Cavity? Therefore, trust this truth: enter directly through the ancestral cavity, follow it with thought extinguished and passions forgotten, and every step will be free and unobstructed. Not daring to keep this secret, I respectfully share it with fellow seekers, hoping only that they will still their minds and embody it.\n\nWithin the human body, between the heart below and the kidneys above, precisely one inch and two *fen* at the center—this is the cavity of the primordial, original ancestral *qi*. Scholars must recognize this single path clearly before they may cultivate and advance upon the great Dao. They must also gather and refine every aspect of the physical form, so that the original spirit may find its proper dwelling. The ancients said: *\"There is a precious pearl, sealed within the mountain of form.\"* Little do they know that this very pearl resides within the six sense gates, constantly radiating great luminosity—yet most fail to awaken, thus living in vain and dying in delusion. I now point out the path clearly and plainly.\n\nThough the human body possesses six senses, all arise from a single root. The essential mechanism is this: the Three Origins merge as one, the Four Images harmonize and unite, returning to emptiness and nothingness. Still the body, heart, and intent; gather the acquired spirit of the self and return it to the Central Palace. Maintain constant awareness, moment by moment align with the center, and practice the work of embracing the origin and guarding the One. With long and thorough cultivation, essence, *qi*, and spirit become complete, the Mysterious Female establishes its foundation, true *qi* is generated, and true lead is transformed. Only then may one investigate the subsequent methods, and the practice will bear fruit. This is the wondrous mechanism of celestial immortals’ cultivation and realization. Those who attain it ascend immediately to the realm of sages—yet without great wisdom, how could one comprehend these profound mysteries?\n\nMaster Min Xiaogen says: Though this section describes a provisional method, without employing it as a means, the student has no path forward. The gateway to the profound is most difficult to open, yet the method of opening lies not in effortful action but in the four characters: emptiness, nothingness, stillness, and non-movement. What is called the \"path\" is but a single root; what is called \"practice\" is the merging and harmonizing, along with the gathering, returning, and refining of the spirit. Once returned to the palace, one has already penetrated the Mysterious Cavity—this is the first step of the provisional method. Constant awareness is the essential second step; moment-by-moment alignment with the center is the third step of the practice. Scholars who cultivate in accordance with this hold fast to embracing the origin and guarding the One. What is the origin? The primordial ancestral *qi*. What is the One? The original, inherent nature. With long and thorough practice, one naturally attains mastery. Once mastery is attained, the Three Treasures become complete. Yet the text does not yet speak of the foundation being established—this is merely the initial foundation of the Mysterious Female, before *qi* has transformed into true *qi* and the original life has been restored. Only when *qi* returns and transforms into true *qi* does true lead begin to arrive. When true lead is about to arrive, one may proceed with the subsequent methods. Scholars must thoroughly recognize that in this single moment of living *zi*, lead suddenly arrives and mercury responds, and thus they congeal and coalesce—all depending on the sufficiency of the work of refining the self and establishing the foundation!\n\nMaster Taixu says: *\"When yang arises, yin responds—this is a principle that arrives spontaneously without expectation.\"* Master Niwan says: *\"Do not worry that true yin will fail to respond to me; only fear that the arising of yang may not be genuine.\"* Scholars may awaken to this!\n\nHaving mastered the preceding practices, one may then proceed to the work of recognizing and preserving spirit within the *qi*-cavern. Gather the eyes, ears, and nose inward—let the eyes not gaze outward, the ears not listen outward, the nose not smell outward—so that the original spirit wholly returns to the *qi*-cavern. Naturally, the breath becomes harmonized and even, continuous yet subtle, as if faintly present. This is the true oral instruction for nurturing the medicine.\n\nChen Xubai says:\n*\"Lower the curtains, seal the senses,\nSuppress desires, regulate the breath.\nDetach from form, abandon intellect—\nNearly forgetting all in seated stillness.\nI urge you: remain silent all day, like a fool,\nAnd refine a wish-fulfilling pearl.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan says:\n*\"I once received my teacher’s true oral instruction:\nSimply preserve spirit within the *qi*-cavern.\"*\n\nBoth speak of the oral instructions for establishing the foundation.\n\nFormerly, the Venerable Master Liu of Ming’an said:\n*\"To begin and establish the foundation of the elixir,\nApply the principle of *zi* and *wu*.\nThe moment stillness stirs,\nIt is the time when *gui* arises.\"*\n\nSuch words are addressed to those newly entering the circle. The so-called \"establishing the foundation of the elixir\" refers only to the work of nurturing the medicine, not to the gathering of the great medicine. The phrase *\"do not apply *zi* and *wu*\"* is meant to dispel the doubt that one might mistake this for the *zi-wu* circulation of ascent and descent within the body, or for the practice of working at the *zi* and *wu* hours. Thus, the words *\"do not apply\"* serve to awaken the practitioner and distinguish the sequence of practice. The *\"time\"* referred to here is the *\"time\"* mentioned in the *Mirror for Entering the Medicine*: *\"At any of the twelve hours, wherever the intent reaches, it may be taken as the time.\"* Why should one be confined to the *zi* and *wu* hours?\n\n*\"The moment stillness stirs\"* refers to the instant when *yin* reaches its extreme and *yang* arises, when emptiness attains its utmost and stillness is profound. Thus, when movement occurs, it is the *\"time when *gui* arises.\"* The Ancestor reveals the ford to cross the river of delusion, teaching that upon seeing *yang* arise, one should immediately gather it, without waiting for *gui* to reach its fullness and the opportunity to pass in vain. If one gathers only after *gui* is complete, one obtains merely the *yang* *qi* that arises in accordance with the seasons—this is not the great medicine. Only by gathering the moment stillness stirs does one obtain the primordial *yang* that precedes the birth of the myriad things, the divine mother that gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings—the very primordial unity of *qi*.\n\nMin Xiaogen says: *\"I note that the arising of *yang* at the outset, though spontaneous, still belongs to the realm of provisional methods. Thus, the *yang* that arises and is gathered pertains only to the *yang* of the individual body. Though called 'primordial,' it still belongs to the posterior. Even in the *Mirror for Entering the Medicine*, though the arising of *yang* is not a provisional method, it is said to occur 'where intent reaches,' and thus remains dependent on intent. What is thus aroused still belongs to the posterior aspect of the primordial. To call it 'not the great medicine' is an exceedingly precise distinction.\"*\n\nNiwan says: *\"At any of the twelve hours, when the mechanism arises suddenly, it is the primordial *qi*—do not underestimate it. If one can gather it in time, it is indeed the supreme treasure. The ancient sages who obtained it, even if their form and spirit were not yet full, used it to refine and complete the outer defenses, or to cultivate the yellow chamber of the spirit-room, and so on.\"*\n\nThis teaching has been repeatedly and thoroughly presented by Yang Lin of my lineage. All fellow practitioners may study and ponder it.\n\nAs for the true arising of *zi*-*yang* and the obtaining of the great medicine, this is not a fixed doctrine. Taixu says: *\"When encounter and response coincide, and the body is fundamentally in utmost emptiness, at the time of profound stillness, then what is obtained is immeasurable, and what arises is unfathomable. If one is not yet empty and still, or merely empty but not still, there is absolutely no principle by which one may obtain it.\"*\n\nThus, whenever I speak of the method of observing return, I invariably emphasize the two oral instructions: *\"Utmost emptiness\"* and *\"profound stillness.\"* How many truly understand this instruction? Now that I am old and may soon return to emptiness, if this instruction is not transmitted to the world, it will be like a lion without fur, roaring soundlessly—would this not be a great regret? Therefore, I have clarified and revised the discussion of the term *\"time\"* in this section, adding annotations here. May those who encounter this treasure it and embody it.\n\nThe *Elixir Classics* say: *\"Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; humans obtain the One and attain longevity.\"* This primordial unity of *qi* emerges from the midst of emptiness and nothingness—yet it is not the same as the complete emptiness of the void. To guard stillness to its utmost in emptiness and nothingness, dwelling in the midst of indistinct obscurity, with the great primordial unity settled, the spirit naturally arrives. The singular numen remains ever serene—this is the true primordial, empty yet not empty.\n\nMin Xiaogen says: *\"I note that this primordial is not merely the primordial of the individual body; it is the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate. It is not the *qi* of two aspects, empty and full, and thus it is empty yet not empty.\"*\n\nIn my humble opinion: *\"This primordial\"* refers to the *qi* of the Great Ultimate; *\"yet it is not\"* refers to the *qi* that flows forth in the Three Powers. Now, in describing the method of practice, it speaks of attaining stillness in emptiness—its meaning is profoundly subtle. For emptiness is the substance, and stillness is the practice. Without stillness, one cannot obtain it; without stillness in emptiness, one cannot attain its fullness. I fear that practitioners may suspect this contradicts the previously annotated methods, and thus I have taken up my brush to clarify it.\n\nAs for the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate, it may serve as the mother; the flowing *qi* of the Great Ultimate may serve as nourishment—both belong to the great medicine, yet they differ. The Great Ultimate is what gives rise to the two aspects, while this ancestral *qi* is what the Great Ultimate itself emerges from. It can form the embryo, and thus is called the mother. The flowing *qi* is the *qi* emitted within the Great Ultimate by the Three Powers. In creation, it is primordial; in the Dao, it is posterior. Among these, the clear and turbid are not uniform, and they can only be gathered for nurturing—thus it is said to serve as nourishment. Those of middle and lower capacity who obtain this to form an embryo produce only an illusory image, not the sacred infant. Therefore, the subsequent three sections of oral instructions are provided to distinguish and elaborate these differences, clarifying that human capacities vary and elixir grades differ.\n\nThe Ren channel carries yang water, which is the *qi* of emptiness and clarity, while the Gui channel carries yin water, which is the substance of matured medicine. Daoist alchemists favor yang and disfavor yin, for Gui water is what the Dao of the Elixir abhors. Thus, the true yang that arises possesses *qi* but no substance—it is the *qi* of pure yang. If delayed even slightly, substance will form! Once substance forms, it becomes Gui water—how could such a heavy and turbid thing reverse its flow and ascend? This is why Ancestor Master Ziyang had the oral instruction: *\"When lead encounters Gui’s birth, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\n\nWhenever \"Gui’s birth\" is spoken of, it is out of fear that it will arise, not out of delight in its arising. Do not mistakenly take Gui’s birth for yang’s birth—only then will it be wondrous. Once yang has arisen, one must immediately use true intention to draw it into the Central Palace, where it unites with the true yin within Li. This is the initial work of the dragon and tiger’s mating.\n\n[Min Xiaogen says: The discourse on the Dao of the Elixir favoring yang and abhorring clarity is indeed an unassailable, immutable principle. Yet if one’s aim is merely to nourish life, even if the timing is missed, it need not be discarded—there is another method of practice. After breaking through the summit, one may simply allow it to disperse throughout the body, forgetting form to nurture *qi*. Then, when a cool sensation reaches the heart, it transforms into true yin, flowing through the four limbs, returning to the hundred meridians, and moistening the sinews and joints. This is also a wondrous method for cultivating and supplementing the physical body, though one must strictly guard against retaining it in the palace, where it would turn into the \"drink of clouds.\"\n\nMaster Taixu spoke of this for elderly Dao learners, saying it resembles the \"returning and restoring method\" mentioned by the Perfected One Shi Xinglin. Those in their youth and prime must never recklessly adopt this.]\n\nThe *Classic of the Elixir* states: \"The dragon emerges from fire,\" meaning the dragon is born within *li*. It further says: \"The tiger is born in water,\" meaning the tiger is born within *kan*. The method of elixir refinement proceeds thus: at the outset, the dragon is summoned to the tiger; subsequently, the tiger responds to the dragon. When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its deepest, simply settle the original spirit into the *qi*-cavern, allowing it to breathe of its own accord—no deliberate action may be taken, nor any intention of seeking achievement entertained. One must remain leisurely and at ease, without attachment, lest disharmony arise; only then does it accord with the spirit’s function. Over time, the breath need not be regulated, for harmony arises naturally. If one must rise and move, one must first close the eyes and sit in stillness, allowing it to return to its original cavern, and only arise once complete tranquility is attained. Take heed, take heed! Should one be compelled to rise due to unavoidable circumstances, once the matter is resolved, one must resume the prior practice—this too is a method of adjustment.\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: The passage beginning \"at the outset\" corresponds to the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*’s \"true earth captures true lead\"; the passage beginning \"subsequently\" corresponds to \"true lead restrains true mercury\"; the passage beginning \"simply settle\" corresponds to \"lead and mercury return to true earth\"; and the passage beginning \"allowing it\" corresponds to \"body and mind remain still and unmoving.\" The essential principles of elixir refinement are fully encompassed here! Those who have not yet understood the dragon and tiger must seek the guidance of an enlightened teacher to recognize that these are metaphors for the unrefined body and mind. The key oral instructions in this section lie in the two instances of \"allowing\": first, \"no deliberate action may be taken,\" and second, \"breathing must not be intentional\"—these are the utmost cautions. The phrases \"one must,\" \"may not,\" \"lest it give rise to,\" and \"only then does it accord\" convey such earnest admonition! Yet fearing that the seeker may be overly eager for results, the text further advises \"over time,\" and so on. We who study these texts must aim for clarity and understanding—how can we pass over them carelessly? All learners in the world suffer from this flaw. Thus, I append these few words as a sincere exhortation: may those of like aspiration correct themselves if they err, and redouble their efforts if they do not. As the ancients said: \"Reading requires a single eye—nothing more than careful reflection.\"]\n\nBeginning forty-nine days before the Winter Solstice, one must first devote effort in advance, so that the solitary yang revives beneath the five yins. With this primordial qi, one transforms the postnatal spirit into a yang spirit—this is a rare method in the world, its subtlety beyond easy description!\n\nHowever, during the foundational stage, the work of cultivating the medicine and gathering the great medicine each has its distinctions; they must not be practiced indiscriminately. Only then can one be called a true adept of our Dao!\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: This preliminary effort is precisely the practice of self-mastery. For in cultivating the supreme Dao, one must first open the mysterious aperture; if this aperture remains closed, progress in practice is nearly impossible. Yet it is not through mere circulation that this opening occurs—it must be aided by self-mastery. When the mind is purified of extraneous thoughts, the will becomes singular; with the will and thoughts thus unified, the mysterious aperture naturally opens wide. My master, Tai Xu, has explained this in detail.\n\nNevertheless, fearing that some may harbor expectations of quick results, I reluctantly mention the forty-nine-day period. Let the learner examine themselves: if the heart is not yet pure, why not begin at the Summer Solstice? Or even at the Winter Solstice of the previous year? This aligns with the first chapter’s principle of \"the longer the accumulation, the better\"—it is not a rigidly fixed schedule.\n\nThe distinctions between cultivating the medicine and gathering the great medicine have already been clarified above; I will not repeat them here. Yet there remains a great doubt, seldom addressed in ancient or modern alchemical texts, and even this book does not discuss it—how many aspirants have been misled by it! Knowing this, I dare not leave it unexamined.\n\nTake, for instance, Master Bai Ziqing’s *On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, a text recited by all in our lineage. Yet how many recite it without truly grasping its meaning? What is this doubt? It lies in the single word \"gathering.\"\n\nThose who do not understand the body merely skim the text like a galloping horse viewing flowers—they do not even question the word, let alone discern its meaning. But for those who seek true realization, they may mistake it for deliberate action, blindly seeking and erring, falling into the path of laborious effort, and casting this discourse aside. How tragic!\n\nDoes the *Treatise* not state: \"Take the body as the crucible, the heart as mercury, stability as water, and wisdom as fire\"? And further: \"Use essence, spirit, soul, and intent as medicinal ingredients; take movement, stillness, sitting, and lying as the firing times; employ clarity and naturalness as the method of operation.\" Regarding the refining process, it says: \"Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; the heart as the chamber of spirit; seated meditation as the gathering; mindful observation as the firing; starting and stopping as advancing and retreating; interruption and distraction as embankments; operation as drawing and adding; true qi’s steaming as bathing; calming thoughts as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing concerns as life and death; the movement of thought as the mysterious female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as the elixir’s completion; transferring spirit as changing the vessel; having a body beyond the body as rebirth; returning to the origin as the true teaching; and shattering emptiness as fulfillment.\"\n\nHow clear this is! Gathering occurs solely in seated meditation—if this doubt remains unresolved, one may err as far as north from south. A lifetime of practice may yield no result, dismissed as lacking fortune, which is truly lamentable.\n\nI urge all fellow aspirants: first embody the word \"cultivate.\" Though the vehicles may be three, the essential method of gathering remains singular.]\n\n**Third: The Union of Kan and Li**\n\nOnce the foundation-building of the cultivator of truth proves effective, one must not slacken but continue as before: regulating the breath through the nose, sealing the tongue’s qi, concentrating the ears’ resonance, and closing the valley passage. The four images harmonize and return to emptiness. One must ensure the body and mind remain unmoving, drawing the postnatal spirit back to the place of the true person’s breath, guarding it without loss, and uniting it with qi. Naturally, one reaches the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness.\n\nSuddenly, one feels a subtle stirring at the sea bottom, and light shines through, resembling a new moon hanging in the southwest—like the moon on the third day rising in the geng direction, this is the initial appearance of metal qi. Within Kan, a single point of warm qi surges upward to the heart’s ruler. With intention, one guides it downward along the yellow path, passing through the tail gate, traversing the spine’s bridge, piercing the jade pillow, entering the muddy pellet, and roaming the nine palaces. From above, it descends, warm like dripping water, fragrant as awakening nectar, sweet as dew. The eyes send it into emptiness, the mind welcomes it into nothingness, and it naturally returns to the inner point—this is the marvel of the union of Kan and Li.\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: This return method is the initial practice of fetal breathing. The statement \"after reaching extreme emptiness and profound stillness, light shines through the curtains, resembling a new moon\" follows conventional teachings, though it may not always be so. Sometimes it appears as a millet grain or a pearl, but it always manifests in the abdomen—whether called the kun position or geng direction, it merely signifies the initial appearance of metal qi.\n\nThe claim that \"a single point of warm qi surges to the heart\" is also not fixed; one must guide it downward with intention. As for the original text’s \"passing through the tail gate via the yellow path to the jade pillow,\" this is a grave error, surely a corruption or omission. (I have) thus amended it to \"via the yellow path through the tail gate,\" adding \"traversing the spine’s bridge, piercing the jade pillow, and entering the muddy pellet.\"\n\nFor the human body has three paths: black, red, and yellow. The yellow path ascends straight along the seam between the kidneys in front and the navel behind; it rises along the seam between the spine in front and the heart behind, directly piercing the muddy pellet. The red path ascends in reverse along the green path, joins the black, and follows the yellow upward to the niwan, then again joins the black and follows the yellow to return to the cinnabar field. The black path, starting from the sea, joins the red and follows the yellow in reverse, piercing the tail gate to reach the pillow, then from the niwan joins the red and follows the yellow along the forehead to the pond, descending to the cinnabar field and returning to the sea.]\n\nThese three paths follow such courses, yet few in the world know the origin of their names—truly, they are the Three Treasures of body, heart, and intent. The heart pertains to *Qian*; *Qian*’s fundamental position lies in *Li*, whose color is red, hence the name “red path,” which is in fact the *Ren* meridian of the body. The nature of *Ren* is to blaze upward, yet in practice one must cause it to descend. The body pertains to *Kun*; *Kun*’s fundamental position lies in *Kan*, whose color is black, hence the name “black path,” which is in fact the *Du* meridian of the body. The nature of *Du* is to moisten downward, yet in practice one must cause it to ascend—this is called “inverting Yin and Yang,” for *Du* is Yang while *Ren* is Yin. As for the names *Du* and *Ren*, their meaning is drawn from *Qian*’s strength and *Kun*’s compliance.\n\nIntent pertains to Earth, whose color is yellow, hence the name “yellow path.” Such is the conventional explanation, though the profound meaning within is not easily exhausted. For instance, the *Classic* refers to the red and black as the “human path” and to the yellow as the “immortal path”—how could one fail to fathom its purport?\n\nYour disciple Yanglin’s exegesis of *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* is most detailed and lucid. His explanation states: “*Kan* is the body, *Li* is the heart, and the foundation of *Kan* and *Li* is intent. In the prior heavens, *Kan* resides in the West as *po*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the North, where *po* has already flowed into essence—now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging essence and *po* into one household is the body. In the prior heavens, *Li* resides in the East as *hun*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the South, where *hun* has already manifested as spirit—now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging spirit and *hun* into one household is the heart. Only Earth, dwelling at the center and uniting the Four Symbols, is the true foundation of *Kan* and *Li* in both prior and posterior heavens—unchanged by the shift between them, this is intent. When Earth is raised to house the body and gather the heart, causing body, heart, and intent to merge into one place, undivided and unceasing, nurturing the true to achieve abundance and the power to generate beings—is this not the state where all things are complete within me and the Three Realms return to this single body?”\n\nSuch is his explanation, which, when applied to comprehend the three paths, makes their nature as clear as pointing to the palm of one’s hand.\n\nMaster Lü said: “To cultivate the immortal path, first perfect the human path; without cultivating the human path, the immortal path remains distant.” Master Niwan stated: “The immortal path and the human path lie nowhere beyond this body.” Yet世人误会, seeking explanations outside the body, find no place to begin. For they are ignorant of the principle that the red and black constitute the human, and only when the human is purified and returns to white can one revert to the yellow.\n\nMaster Taixu said: “The sagely work of the elixir path lies in nothing beyond return and reversion.” To embody the red and black is to emerge from *Li* and *Kan*; the task of learning and reversion must begin with the refining of *Li* and *Kan*, striving to return the posterior to the prior, transforming the mundane into the sagely. Yet the common flaw among learners lies in haste, often skipping stages to advance, leading to errors such as “disturbing the yellow” and arousing doubt.\n\nI have elaborated on this in my annotations to *The Heart Transmission of Heavenly Immortals*. Fellow cultivators may consult it to understand that I did not devise this teaching lightly. This text contains many profound principles and is indeed a rare work for elixir path practitioners. Unfortunately, through repeated transcription, errors such as miswritten characters and missing phrases have arisen. Without correction, faults like “disturbing the yellow” may occur, with no small consequences.\n\nThough I have now emended the text, I have not expounded its profound principles in detail, and later learners may still struggle to follow it, potentially hindering their progress—this must be considered. I have also changed the character “pass” (*guo*) to “pierce” (*tou*) in “piercing the jade pillow,” for this jade pillow is a narrow and bony passage, also called the “iron wall.” If later learners have not yet transformed it and forcibly attempt to cross and descend, they will inevitably suffer the harm of “disturbing the yellow”—minor cases result in brain swelling, major cases in brain injury—its perils are severe and must not be ignored.\n\nThe phrase below, “the eyes send off and the intent welcomes,” refers to gathering the heart and eyes together into emptiness and nothingness. The subsequent term “ding” (cauldron) denotes the correct position for concentrating life—do not hastily mistake the head for the *Qian* cauldron.\n\nThis pertains to the initial practice of fetal breathing, yet it must not be taken lightly. Without utmost emptiness and profound stillness, fetal breathing cannot be attained. The “minor celestial orbit” of Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring is precisely what this passage describes, emphasizing unwavering constancy and the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\n**Chapter Four: Gathering the Medicine and Returning to the Cauldron**\n\nHaving achieved the union of Kan and Li, with body and heart already merged, one must not yet rely on this wondrous coalescence to congeal. At this moment of \"the eyes sending off and the intent welcoming,\" one must still take emptiness as the essence and stillness as the practice, without regard to time, cultivating until reaching utmost emptiness and profound stillness. Gradually, one returns to the dim and boundless chaos, the state of natural depth and silence, where suddenly a thunderous sound arises, as if silk is torn—this is the activation of the Heavenly Root’s mechanism.\n\nInstantly, the elixir field grows fiery, both kidneys simmer like boiling water. Upon attaining this sign, the entire body is suddenly drawn to the sea bottom. The eyes send the flow through the *Chang* gate, while the intent welcomes it upward, surging through the Three Passes with a thunderous roar, dragons and thunder like fire ascending straight to the celestial thoroughfare. Then, one feels a sudden gathering, converging at the *Niwan* palace—this is the wind stirring in the Moon Cavern. Soon after, a radiant orb wells up between the brows, and unconsciously, it descends via the Magpie Bridge through the Tower of Nine Stories. One tastes a beauty like borneol, a coolness like peppermint, permeating the heart and spleen—this is the Moon’s clarity in the Crimson Palace. Then, it is sent back to the Earthen Cauldron, completing the gathering of the medicine and its return.\n\nThe term *ding* (cauldron) is the name of a hexagram in the *Yi* symbolism, referring to what the ancient elixir formulas call \"obtaining the medicine in two of the five phases within a single double-hour.\" Reverting to the silent circulation of the celestial orbit’s fire phases is called \"sealing and securing in four phases.\" Yet what is obtained here is called the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir—formless yet still possessing a form that can be imaged.\n\nAs the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Take the solid center of the Kan position to pierce the yin within the Li’s belly,\"* and again: *\"One grain after another, from the subtle to the manifest\"*—this is the method of procuring and storing the ingredients.\n\n[Min Xiaogen says: This is the method of refining and obtaining the Valley Spirit, namely \"taking from Kan to fill Li,\" which means using the postnatal Kan to fill the postnatal Li, thereby restoring the original positions of the prenatal Qian and Kun.]\n\nMaster Xue said: *\"The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the mystery of the midnight hour lies in heart-to-heart instruction.\"* He also said: *\"The breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers; the jade clepsydra’s chill drips in perfect accord.\"* This is the orally transmitted method of the celestial orbit’s fire phases.\n\nThus the Perfected One of Emerald Emptiness said:\n*\"When the myriad winds first stir,\nAnd the thousand peaks’ moon stands full,\nHasten to issue the true command—\nThen may you set the celestial orbit in motion.\"*\nThese lines cite Master Shi’s words to validate Master Xue’s oral instructions, teaching one to practice in natural alignment with its secret essence.\n\nMaster of Hengyang observed: *\"In all elixir-refining, when fire is kindled at the true midnight hour as yang qi arises, the fire’s power is complete—at no other time is this so. For at the exact midnight hour, the Great Yang resides in the north, precisely when one’s qi reaches the Weilu Pass. At this moment, fire is kindled just as the body’s yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir. When the true midnight hour of heaven and earth coincides with the living midnight hour within the body, inner and outer unite—only then is the wondrous mechanism of heaven and human joined in perfect accord, fully stealing the creative power of heaven and earth to form the elixir.\"* His explanation is most clear and accurate. Though those who attain this may not always follow it strictly, it still serves to elucidate Master Xue’s heart-transmitted secret instructions.\n\nRegarding the numbers of the celestial orbit, he held that from *zi* to *si*—the six yang positions corresponding to Qian’s tally—total two hundred sixteen counts. Subtracting the thirty-six counts of *mao* yang (used for bathing and ceasing fire), one actually practices one hundred eighty counts. From *wu* to *hai*—the six yin positions corresponding to Kun’s tally—total one hundred forty-four counts. Subtracting the twenty-four counts of *you* yin (used for bathing and halting the tally), one actually practices one hundred twenty counts. Together these make three hundred breaths. Including the bathing periods, the total reaches three hundred sixty breaths, with an intercalary remainder of twenty-four counts, making three hundred eighty-four breaths. This interpretation of *\"the breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers\"* is indeed precise and detailed. Yet if one is instructed to count these breaths attentively during practice, the advancing fire may become too vigorous and cumbersome, while the retreating tally may grow disordered and lose its harmony—how is this different from entangling silk? Does it not diverge from Bai Ziqing’s method of advancing, retreating, withdrawing, and adding fire, along with bathing?\n\nOne must recognize that Master Xue, having said *\"the breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers,\"* immediately followed with *\"the jade clepsydra’s chill drips in perfect accord\"*—to awaken the practitioner to the foundational technique, originally teaching one to align the breath-count with the celestial orbit through spiritual movement. As Bai Ziqing said, this is the method of *\"using quiescence and naturalness as the means of operation.\"* Zhang Ziyang’s words—*\"Fire phases do not depend on time; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*. As for the bathing method, it is likened to the emptiness of *mao* and *you*\"*—express the same principle.\n\nThus, all original diagrams, explanations, and trivial details—such as nasal inhalation, swallowing, palm depressions, and wheel positions—have been entirely excised to avoid obstructing the practitioner’s mind and vision. The student, upon reaching this stage, need only silently contemplate and circulate the words *\"subtlest, drip by drip\"*—naturally, intention will not leak, and one will feel only the interdependence of heart and breath, the breath harmonized and the heart stilled. This is the moment when the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir is accomplished!\n\nMaster Xue further said:\n*\"The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire;\nFew have ever known the fire phases.\nDo not treat the fire phases as child’s play—\nWith the immortals, you must ponder them carefully.\"*\nThis shows that the reason the fire was not transmitted is precisely to prevent practitioners from becoming ensnared by its explanations, thereby hindering the fire phases. Hence he said: *\"Do not treat it as child’s play; you must ponder it carefully.\"*\n\nThe practitioner must understand that the medicine is the fire, and the fire is the medicine. When one’s body and heart unite in gathering, it is called the medicine; when body and heart merge wondrously in concentration, deliberately preserving the Great Harmony, it is called the fire. How can one mistake inhaling celestial winds, swallowing earthly fluids, pinching palm positions, or moving through the palaces as the fire phases of the celestial orbit? This would be like counting sand or disturbing the true intent—would it not violate the warning against treating the fire phases as child’s play? Our school’s scholars must discern this clearly.\n\n[Min Xiaogen says: By the middle ages of the world, bodies with unbroken true yang were already rare. Thus the three chapters of practice—*Kan-Li intercourse, gathering the medicine and returning it to the crucible, and the fire phases of the celestial orbit*—were established for the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir. These serve only to replenish the postnatal leakage of yang essence, yang qi, and yang spirit, restoring them to the state of a virgin body. If one hears the Dao in youth and is willing to begin practice, first refining the self and laying the foundation, then the intercourse of Qian and Kun can proceed—this is the supreme vehicle, the highest-grade direct elixir method. In the absence of such individuals, this middle-grade elixir method of three chapters must be inserted into the highest-grade method to mend postnatal deficiencies, making one identical to a virgin in truth. Only then can one proceed to the following practice of Qian-Kun intercourse. The original text’s content clearly belongs to the lowest-grade elixir method and cannot be the original writing of Hengyang. It has therefore been deleted and omitted.]\n\n**6. The Intercourse of Qian and Kun**\n\n**6. The Intercourse of Qian and Kun**\n\nFrom the three preceding methods of practice, once Kan and Li have conjoined to form the medicine, and the medicine is gathered into the crucible to circulate the fire, when the fire’s revolution reaches completion, the positions of the primordial Qian and Kun are established. From this point onward, one must not seek through form or appearance. Instead, empty the heart to attain the utmost emptiness, solidify the abdomen to uphold the deepest stillness, and with sincerity within, inwardly observe one’s return—naturally attaining profound and unwavering stability. Pure and refined in essence, the mechanism stirs abruptly, and suddenly, the self and the existing forms of heaven and earth vanish. One only perceives luminous clarity, boundless and infinite. At the first moment of awareness, swiftly gather it in, and instantly enter profound quiescence, merging into the aperture—dim and obscure, unknowing and unperceiving, soundless and odorless. This is the great opening of the mysterious pass, the deep entry into the singular aperture. After a time, a single point descends into the Yellow Court, and this is the return of the primordial qi, naturally circulating through the six voids. Only then does one realize that this body is originally the altar, crucible, and furnace; the heart is the chamber of spirit, and within it, I am but a single true intention. One feels the qi fresh and the spirit clear, the body harmonious and the heart at ease, while heaven and earth, sun and moon remain soft as silk—this is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. One only perceives a radiant, rounded luminosity, like an original pearl resting on a crystal plate, yet in truth, it is formless and imageless. This is what the sages call \"the solitary revelation of numinous emptiness,\" and what the former master described as \"Qian and Kun merging to perfect my Great Ultimate.\"\n\nAt this stage, the adept must guard the subtle with utmost care, washing the heart and retiring into secrecy, thoughtless and effortless, naturally empty yet inexhaustible—this is the method of the ten-month gestation. As Bai Ziqing said: \"A moment’s coagulation, ten months’ gestation—no hexagrams, no weight.\" The method is simple and easy, yet only the superior adept can practice it; herein lies the ease of attainment.\n\n**7. The Ten-Month Gestation**\n\nOnce the numinous elixir has returned to the chamber of spirit, as the ancients said: \"The elixir crucible and river chariot rest from toil, while the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow gently on.\" Wang Chongyang said: \"Once the sacred embryo is congealed, nurture it with the gentle fire, settle the spirit and regulate the breath, letting it be natural.\" The Elder of Zhengyang said: \"No need to tend the fire—within the crucible, it is warm of itself.\" The Patriarch of Apricot Grove said: \"Refining qi is labor in vain; preserving spirit is effort wasted. How could one know the marvel of the elixir’s secret? Daylong, one plays with true emptiness.\" All these are the true oral instructions for gestation.\n\nThough one may have obtained the great medicine, with the five colors appearing, the common practitioner calls this the formation of the embryo, yet it has not undergone transformation. Thus, the immortal master said: \"The treasure in the cinnabar field is not the true treasure; only the re-congealed numinous embryo is the sacred embryo.\" After obtaining the elixir, the ten-month gestation begins. From this point onward, one must diligently tend to it at every moment, guarding it ceaselessly, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding its egg, ensuring the warmth never ceases, so that the numinous embryo gradually solidifies. The essence is gentle warmth—thoughts must not arise, for their arising stokes the fire; intention must not scatter, for its scattering cools the fire. One must avoid excess or deficiency, maintaining only the crucible’s gentle warmth—there is no other method. Any contrivance invites immediate danger. Be cautious! Be cautious!\n\nThroughout the ten months of practice, from beginning to end, one must remain as if in a single day, at every moment preserving the state before the seven emotions arise and at every instant safeguarding the body before the eight consciousnesses are defiled. Only thus can one refine and cultivate it to achieve the perfection of spirit and the transformation of the embryo. If the elixir fire grows hot, visualize a black sphere the size of a bowl between the brows, gather it into the chamber of spirit, and the heat will subside—this must not be forgotten.\n\n**8. Moving the Spirit and Changing the Crucible**\n\nOnce the ten-month gestation is complete, the qi is full and the spirit whole, and the infant manifests its form. Emerging from the womb, one may then move the spirit and change the crucible. The Ancestor Qiu of Everlasting Spring considered this the direct ascent from the central palace to the upper Yellow—the upper Yellow is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Heavenly Valley, the purest realm of the human body.\n\nThis infant is entirely formed of the primordial, not of mundane essence, mundane qi, or mundane spirit. It appears and vanishes at will, can penetrate metal and stone, and leaves no trace. To describe it as an embryo or infant is merely metaphor. Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: \"The *Heart Transmission of the Supreme* speaks of preserving it as an infant—this means one must nurture it as an infant, a compassionate teaching that uses the concrete to verify the empty.\" Yet Master Duanyang said: \"Once the Dharma-body is congealed, the spirit must be further stabilized.\" Hence the relocation to the Heavenly Valley is not merely for its purity but follows the natural principle. Those who misunderstand its intent speak of concealment and manifestation, appearing and disappearing. The adept must remain in serene stability, rightly positioned within the body, undeluded by the soul or spirit, so that inner and outer are luminously clear.\n\nXiao Zixu said: \"Moving the spirit to the Heavenly Valley is precisely for refining the nature. When the Three Flowers gather at the crown and the Five Qi converge at the void, there may be a moment of myriad distractions, yet one who can remain steadfast in non-action is stabilized by wisdom, and thus the mechanism attains spontaneous quiescence. However, few learners preserve tranquility, often disturbed by the esoteric teachings of alchemical schools regarding the manifestation of the yang spirit.\" Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: \"The Great Dao is formless—what form or appearance could it have? The Great Dao is nameless—what numinous sageliness could it possess? All these names and titles, these supreme esoteric teachings, are but means to clarify one thing through another, transforming the illusory into the real through marvelous function. Yet the ultimate spiritual achievement lies entirely in refining it when moving the spirit to the Heavenly Valley. Alas, such teachings on the convergence of nature and life have long been lost to the world! Later learners who attain them must not regard the study of nature as unrelated to life. They do not know that the body of refined gold is but the manifestation of the single qi of emptiness and non-being—thus it can instantly vanish or instantly appear.\"\n\nPatriarch Xue further stated: \"Those who can comprehend the profound meaning within the interplay of great movement and great stillness may grasp it in their hearts—do not mix it with conjecture or deliberation. Hold this in awe and proceed with caution.\"\n\n**Chapter Nine: Cultivating Wisdom in the Mud-Pill Palace**\nThe Mud-Pill Palace is the Heavenly Valley of the body, just as the Northern Dipper has its celestial pole, the world has its heavenly axis, and the heavens have the Jade Purity Realm. Once the spirit is moved to the Heavenly Valley, there is no other method—any admixture of contrivance immediately plunges one into illusion and delusion, as the ancient sages have thoroughly explained. The only practice is to still the mind and enter quiescent concentration.\n\nFor humans, though they dwell in form within the world, the true self has not yet transformed, and the true spirit is not yet complete. They cannot yet return to the celestial pole like the stars, nor attain the threefold purity of the heavens, for they remain ununified with the heavenly axis. The heavenly axis is without self, yet the self still clings to selfhood. The celestial pole star is formed of the great mass of true gold—massive yet not merely mass, thus it can align with the celestial mind, transforming as it arises.\n\nWhen we refine the Golden Elixir, it relies entirely on the true Dharma-body of the self and the congealing of the true spirit. Once the great primordial essence is transformed and ascends to dwell in the Heavenly Valley, it must correspond to the celestial axis to align with Heaven. The axis universally illuminates the Three Powers, and so too should I. Yet at first, I only illuminate the Three Powers within this single body. If one does not forget both inner and outer, attaining effortless selflessness, how can one penetrate the Three Realms, follow Heaven in every place, maintain unity in movement and stillness, and remain undivided in gathering and dispersing? This is certainly beyond the reach of those lacking spiritual wisdom, nor can those who rely solely on spiritual wisdom preserve it forever.\n\nThus, Patriarch Xue said: \"Pure Yang once declared, *'Model Heaven and emulate Earth'*—how easily is this spoken! Without attaining the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, one can hardly dwell in the world while transcending it. Yet those who achieve this do so precisely through tempering within the world—what is called *cultivating wisdom in stillness and refining wisdom in movement.*\"\n\nMaster Apricot Grove commented: \"Only fearing that one cannot see through or let go, hence the need for further refinement.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, the method of refinement ultimately lies in nothing but *sincerity*. Sincerity is not merely perfecting oneself but also perfecting others. Thus, sincerity in stillness brings clarity to the spirit, and sincerity in movement brings transparency to one’s nature. When nature is transparent, the spirit naturally attains great stability, and there is nothing in the world one cannot let go of. When the spirit is luminous, nature becomes perfectly penetrating, and there is no principle in the world one cannot see through. This is truly the reverent knowledge of attainment and the sincerity of intention—where the rectification of the mind and the cultivation of the body arise spontaneously, as echo follows sound. This is the true secret of cultivating and refining wisdom.\n\nHere, one cannot know through knowledge, nor perceive through perception, nor divine through divinity. Only by stabilizing the non-divinity of the self does one attain the inherent nature of self-illumination through sincerity. There is destiny, yet the noble person does not act for nature alone—this is the function of refining the spirit. Advancing toward the return to emptiness is founded upon this!\n\n**Chapter Ten: Refining the Spirit to Return to Emptiness**\nStillness gives rise to wisdom, and within stillness lies the movement of ultimate quiescence—the marvel of emptiness that does not bend and movement that ever emerges. Through this, one attains great wisdom and possesses great spiritual powers. Yet if one remains in constant movement without returning, how can wisdom be preserved, and how can the spirit not grow weary? Thus, the patriarchs also transmitted the method of refining the spirit to return to emptiness.\n\nThis method lies in embracing the solitary joy of tranquil observation amid all activity. Within this vast and boundless body and world, the qi-mechanisms within are ever hidden and manifest, yet all are one with me. Observe the common people—though they dwell within it, they are as tiny as a grain, drifting with the world. I alone embody the true and constant, responding to things as they come, neither resisting nor neglecting them. The hidden and manifest seven emotions and eight consciousnesses of the common people are but the pervading qi of Brahma. I alone possess my boundless primordial essence, melting and dissolving until even emptiness is shattered.\n\nYet when one realizes that self and others are one continuum, all ride the Six Qi in ceaseless circulation. Saints and mortals share the same Heaven, with no distinction between form and spirit. Entrusted with the mandate of transforming the earth into Heaven, I do not grasp its power. Responding to the qi-mechanisms of spiritual transformation, I do not seek its effects. Like the sun and moon, which illuminate all without partiality, they have no intent—thus they remain eternally bright through all ages, undiminished through countless kalpas. This is what is meant by *refining* and *returning*—nothing more.\n\nTo speak of refining and returning is still to borrow a method. The adept who returns to emptiness may, like one who has caught the fish, forget the trap.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Refining Emptiness to Merge with the Dao**\nThe previous stage of returning to emptiness has reached the state where self and others are undivided, yet the distinction between self and others still lingers. If this perception is not eradicated, self-mastery remains incomplete. One must advance further beyond the hundred-foot pole.\n\nThe patriarchs also transmitted the method of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao. Only through this can one truly unite with the Dao. For this world and this body are ultimately illusory shadows—visible and audible. If one does not shatter this emptiness, the deluded view of this as real and that as empty, or this as empty and that as real, will persist. As long as this view remains, one can hardly avoid the peril of erosion. Upon encountering worldly conflicts, one will again fall into the dust and turmoil. *\"Restless comings and goings, following the thoughts of companions\"*—how can one extinguish thoughts and forget emotions?\n\nThe method lies in forgetting both reality and illusion, yielding entirely to spontaneity, thereby naturally merging with the Dao. To speak of *refining* is only to *\"shatter emptiness\"*—in that instant, the Dao merges with the natural. This Dao is like the great thoroughfare of Jambudvīpa, traversed by all beings—what is called *\"the royal road is smooth as whetstone, straight as an arrow.\"* The only hindrance is dim eyes, weak feet, or an unfocused will—how could one fail to reach the ultimate?\n\nAlas, the world has lost the Dao, and people lack the single eye of discernment. Worse still, they are misled by false teachers and blind peddlers who point to crooked paths and offer misleading staffs—some even travel south while aiming north. The Most High, moved by compassion, brought forth Master Li of Hengyang to expound these stages of Golden Elixir practice. Yet again, Dao-peddlers have stolen the truth, mixed it with falsehood, and deceived the world for private gain.\n\nLittle do they know that this Dao resides in the human heart, transcending the Three Teachings and all sects. Everyone possesses an indestructible innate knowing and innate ability, directly aligned with the Most High’s mind-to-mind transmission. Hengyang traces its lineage to the Southern School yet humbly inherits the Northern School—both branches of Ancestral Master Lü’s tradition. Master and disciple share one family; how could their words differ?\n\nUpon encountering this text, I lamented its mixture of truth and forgery. Thus, I have mended and compiled it, as if awakening in the same chamber where voices resonate in unison. I intend to bestow it upon later learners, answering the call of those who share the same qi. May future students receive this mind-to-mind transmission free from doubts of borrowed names or metaphors, and without the traces of exhausting the spirit or straining the body.\n\nWith a settled and tranquil mind, one directly perceives the original nature. With not a single thought arising, the wheel of rebirth ceases. The dust-like evil karma of eons dissolves with each thought. Equal to all beings, one attains the fruit of purity—how direct, how joyous! What fear could prevent one from immediately embracing this?\n\nWhen practice reaches its culmination, one naturally receives and returns in full. Like the Yellow Emperor losing and regaining his pearl, or Master Zeng lifting his hands and feet in completion, all fulfill this single move of refining emptiness.\n\nDisciples of the Three Teachings should now suddenly understand!\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Merging with the Dao in Truth**\nWhen practice advances to refining emptiness and merging with the Dao, no further effort can be applied. Measured by one’s learning, this is the point where the sage knows destiny.\n\nIn effortless harmony with the mean, from the world’s perspective, speech becomes hexagrams, silence becomes images. In movement, one moves with Heaven; in stillness, one roams with Heaven. Naturally, eight hundred merits are perfected, three thousand deeds fulfilled—like Confucius acting from the heart’s desire, Yao and Shun governing by desire, Mencius’ \"heavenly people,\" the Buddha’s \"Great Vehicle Golden Immortals,\" or our tradition’s \"Highest-Grade Heavenly Immortals.\"\n\nActing in the world, the nation is governed and the world is at peace. In action, one becomes the world’s Dao; in conduct, the world’s model; in speech, the world’s standard. From afar, one is revered; up close, never resented.\n\nIn spiritual realization of the Great Void, one sustains and bears all without exception, covers and shelters all without limit—nurturing the myriad things without harm, circulating through the six directions without control. One moves in unison with Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing cycles, yet does not share their flaws, obscurities, or vicissitudes.\n\nAs my teacher said: \"One gallops alongside Fuxi, stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.\" In truth, one merges with Fuxi and the Primordial Beginning into boundlessness!\n\nOriginally, this chapter was titled *Awaiting the Imperial Summons for Ascension*, speaking of accumulating merit and deeds to await the celestial decree, the arrival of phoenix and crane, and the ascent of flying transcendence. Such views are narrow, reflecting only the effects of middle- and lower-grade elixir completion, insufficient to attest to the highest-grade elixir method. Thus, I have amended it. May scholars not doubt this.",

      "translated_text": "**The Stages of Superior Elixir Practice: Refining the Self and Cultivating Sincerity as the First Step**\n\nI have often observed that amidst the red dust of the world, all is bustle and confusion—most are drowned in the pursuit of profit and desire, either shackled to fame and career or idly squandering their years, unaware of how to return to their original nature. Though some, blessed with wisdom from past lives, seek the Great Dao, their karmic conditions may not align, and they encounter mediocre guides who lead them astray onto crooked paths, never to awaken in their lifetimes. Thus has the Supreme Dao remained obscured in the world for so long!\n\nBy virtue of good affinities from past lives, I was fortunate to meet a true master and receive instruction in *The Stages of Superior Elixir Practice*. Having now verified its efficacy, I dare not keep it for myself. I must clear away the brambles, open the gate, and point the way to the broad and level path, so that seekers may follow step by step.\n\nIf there are those devoted to the Dao with sincere and unwavering faith, they must first diminish their cravings, reduce speech, lessen thoughts, moderate flavors, guard against cold and heat, and balance labor and rest—thereby cultivating a clear and luminous will. Only then may they hope to ascend to the ranks of immortality.\n\nThus, one must first cultivate sincerity to refine the self, purifying the acquired habits and stains to reveal the original true essence—this is what Confucius meant by \"overcoming the self and returning to propriety.\" If a practitioner can truly refine away the mundane heart and preserve only the true nature, then in all circumstances—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, engaging with affairs or responding to things, or in conduct and self-cultivation—they must sweep away the myriad delusive thoughts of the seven emotions and six desires. In moments of neither seeing nor hearing, they must silently examine and restrain their mind, guarding against the sudden arising and vanishing of thoughts. Gradually, they will reach a state of unknowing and unawareness, where they may seek the inherent flavor of the Dao. Then, all kinds of illusory and false imaginings will have no ground to arise—this is the foundational practice of \"vigilance in solitude.\"\n\nOnly when worldly entanglements cease, the spirit becomes gradually clear, and the body and mind are gathered and concealed in secrecy—returning to the central palace and ancestral aperture—should one no longer wander externally. Instead, focus the spirit and settle the thoughts, nurturing the innate spark of luminosity within.

      "translated_text": "Man’s primordial nature is none other than the Golden Elixir, none other than the Great Dao, none other than the Positionless True Man. Yet the world does not understand what is being cultivated when one refines the Golden Elixir, and so in the end achieves nothing. How lamentable that none point the way, burying so many men of resolve! If one but knew that the primordial spirit of the Elixir Way is one’s own primordial nature—this thing that is inherently one’s own—then, borrowing the body’s prenatal qi to transmute and refine it into a purely yang body, how could there be any who cultivate without success? As Ancestral Master Wang said, *“The primordial nature is called the Golden Elixir; the four temporalities serve as furnace to refine it into a sphere.”*\n\nThe Central Palace and Ancestral Cavity are precisely what the Most High called the Gate of the Mysterious Female. The refinement of the Golden Elixir depends entirely on this cavity. This is what is meant by *“Guard the One, and all things are accomplished.”*\n\n**[Min Xiaogen’s Note:**\nStrictly speaking, the Central Palace and Ancestral Cavity are indeed the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Yet this “central” must be truly recognized—not taken as something with form or location, but as the mean that is neither partial nor impartial, neither excessive nor deficient. Thus it has no direction or place, neither inside nor outside. Whether called the Pearl, the Millet Grain, the Maṇi, the Śarīra, the Golden Elixir, or the Supreme Ultimate, all these borrowed names and aliases are obtained, planted, refined, perfected, liberated, and transformed within this center. Yet to open and enter this Central Palace, this Ancestral Cavity, depends entirely on the purity of self-mastery, cultivated to the point of spontaneity—attaining the state of utter emptiness and profound stillness—only then has one deeply entered the trap! Lose this emptiness and stillness, and one falls outside the cavity. Only by moving and resting with the moment, untainted by personal thought, does one everywhere accord with the Dao.\n\nNow, this single cavity is called “establishing harmony” in the Daoist tradition, while in Confucianism it is the boundary between humanity and animality, and in Buddhism the divide between Māra and Buddha—all hanging by a thread. Yet this Mysterious Cavity is yang on the left and yin on the right, hence called the Mysterious Female. How then does it differ from the Confucian human/animal or Buddhist Māra/Buddha? The reason is this: its yang is true yang, its yin true yin, both belonging to the prenatal, and so it may be collectively called the Mysterious Cavity.\n\nMaster Niwan said, *“When the mechanism moves, one enters the Mysterious; when the mechanism is still, one enters the Female.”* This is the supreme Dao of spontaneity. Yet the *Treatise on Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation* states that *“where the thought moves is the Mysterious Female.”* What is the meaning of this? From the perspective of observing movement within stillness, it is precisely what Confucianism and Buddhism call the boundary between humanity and animality, Māra and Buddha.\n\nAs for the *Preface to the Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, it says, *“Within the human body, seek nowhere else.”* Thus its main text states, *“This cavity is no ordinary cavity; Heaven and Earth together form it.”*\n\nMaster Niwan further said, *“This is a provisional method, yet without seeking here, there is no way to enter at all.”*",

      "translated_text": "Why is this so? This single cavity is boundless in its vastness, yet infinitesimal in its subtlety—thus a grain of millet may contain the great chiliocosm and embrace the Three Powers. The teachings of Master Ziyang on \"attaining the body\" are precise and accessible indeed! Our ancestral Master Niwan’s compassionate instruction of the provisional method—how profound, how profound! The Three Powers all reside within the Mysterious Cavity; how could my body exist outside it? If my body is within the cavity, could the ancestral cavity of my body lie beyond the Mysterious Cavity? Therefore, trust this truth: enter directly through the ancestral cavity, follow it with thought extinguished and passions forgotten, and every step will be free and unobstructed. Not daring to keep this secret, I respectfully share it with fellow seekers, hoping only that they will still their minds and embody it.\n\nWithin the human body, between the heart below and the kidneys above, precisely one inch and two *fen* at the center—this is the cavity of the primordial, original ancestral *qi*. Scholars must recognize this single path clearly before they may cultivate and advance upon the great Dao. They must also gather and refine every aspect of the physical form, so that the original spirit may find its proper dwelling. The ancients said: *\"There is a precious pearl, sealed within the mountain of form.\"* Little do they know that this very pearl resides within the six sense gates, constantly radiating great luminosity—yet most fail to awaken, thus living in vain and dying in delusion. I now point out the path clearly and plainly.\n\nThough the human body possesses six senses, all arise from a single root. The essential mechanism is this: the Three Origins merge as one, the Four Images harmonize and unite, returning to emptiness and nothingness. Still the body, heart, and intent; gather the acquired spirit of the self and return it to the Central Palace. Maintain constant awareness, moment by moment align with the center, and practice the work of embracing the origin and guarding the One. With long and thorough cultivation, essence, *qi*, and spirit become complete, the Mysterious Female establishes its foundation, true *qi* is generated, and true lead is transformed. Only then may one investigate the subsequent methods, and the practice will bear fruit. This is the wondrous mechanism of celestial immortals’ cultivation and realization. Those who attain it ascend immediately to the realm of sages—yet without great wisdom, how could one comprehend these profound mysteries?\n\nMaster Min Xiaogen says: Though this section describes a provisional method, without employing it as a means, the student has no path forward. The gateway to the profound is most difficult to open, yet the method of opening lies not in effortful action but in the four characters: emptiness, nothingness, stillness, and non-movement. What is called the \"path\" is but a single root; what is called \"practice\" is the merging and harmonizing, along with the gathering, returning, and refining of the spirit. Once returned to the palace, one has already penetrated the Mysterious Cavity—this is the first step of the provisional method. Constant awareness is the essential second step; moment-by-moment alignment with the center is the third step of the practice. Scholars who cultivate in accordance with this hold fast to embracing the origin and guarding the One. What is the origin? The primordial ancestral *qi*. What is the One? The original, inherent nature. With long and thorough practice, one naturally attains mastery. Once mastery is attained, the Three Treasures become complete. Yet the text does not yet speak of the foundation being established—this is merely the initial foundation of the Mysterious Female, before *qi* has transformed into true *qi* and the original life has been restored. Only when *qi* returns and transforms into true *qi* does true lead begin to arrive. When true lead is about to arrive, one may proceed with the subsequent methods. Scholars must thoroughly recognize that in this single moment of living *zi*, lead suddenly arrives and mercury responds, and thus they congeal and coalesce—all depending on the sufficiency of the work of refining the self and establishing the foundation!\n\nMaster Taixu says: *\"When yang arises, yin responds—this is a principle that arrives spontaneously without expectation.\"* Master Niwan says: *\"Do not worry that true yin will fail to respond to me; only fear that the arising of yang may not be genuine.\"* Scholars may awaken to this!",

      "translated_text": "Having mastered the preceding practices, one may then proceed to the work of recognizing and preserving spirit within the *qi*-cavern. Gather the eyes, ears, and nose inward—let the eyes not gaze outward, the ears not listen outward, the nose not smell outward—so that the original spirit wholly returns to the *qi*-cavern. Naturally, the breath becomes harmonized and even, continuous yet subtle, as if faintly present. This is the true oral instruction for nurturing the medicine.\n\nChen Xubai says:\n*\"Lower the curtains, seal the senses,\nSuppress desires, regulate the breath.\nDetach from form, abandon intellect—\nNearly forgetting all in seated stillness.\nI urge you: remain silent all day, like a fool,\nAnd refine a wish-fulfilling pearl.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan says:\n*\"I once received my teacher’s true oral instruction:\nSimply preserve spirit within the *qi*-cavern.\"*\n\nBoth speak of the oral instructions for establishing the foundation.\n\nFormerly, the Venerable Master Liu of Ming’an said:\n*\"To begin and establish the foundation of the elixir,\nApply the principle of *zi* and *wu*.\nThe moment stillness stirs,\nIt is the time when *gui* arises.\"*\n\nSuch words are addressed to those newly entering the circle. The so-called \"establishing the foundation of the elixir\" refers only to the work of nurturing the medicine, not to the gathering of the great medicine. The phrase *\"do not apply *zi* and *wu*\"* is meant to dispel the doubt that one might mistake this for the *zi-wu* circulation of ascent and descent within the body, or for the practice of working at the *zi* and *wu* hours. Thus, the words *\"do not apply\"* serve to awaken the practitioner and distinguish the sequence of practice. The *\"time\"* referred to here is the *\"time\"* mentioned in the *Mirror for Entering the Medicine*: *\"At any of the twelve hours, wherever the intent reaches, it may be taken as the time.\"* Why should one be confined to the *zi* and *wu* hours?\n\n*\"The moment stillness stirs\"* refers to the instant when *yin* reaches its extreme and *yang* arises, when emptiness attains its utmost and stillness is profound. Thus, when movement occurs, it is the *\"time when *gui* arises.\"* The Ancestor reveals the ford to cross the river of delusion, teaching that upon seeing *yang* arise, one should immediately gather it, without waiting for *gui* to reach its fullness and the opportunity to pass in vain. If one gathers only after *gui* is complete, one obtains merely the *yang* *qi* that arises in accordance with the seasons—this is not the great medicine. Only by gathering the moment stillness stirs does one obtain the primordial *yang* that precedes the birth of the myriad things, the divine mother that gives birth to heaven, earth, and all beings—the very primordial unity of *qi*.\n\nMin Xiaogen says: *\"I note that the arising of *yang* at the outset, though spontaneous, still belongs to the realm of provisional methods. Thus, the *yang* that arises and is gathered pertains only to the *yang* of the individual body. Though called 'primordial,' it still belongs to the posterior. Even in the *Mirror for Entering the Medicine*, though the arising of *yang* is not a provisional method, it is said to occur 'where intent reaches,' and thus remains dependent on intent. What is thus aroused still belongs to the posterior aspect of the primordial. To call it 'not the great medicine' is an exceedingly precise distinction.\"*\n\nNiwan says: *\"At any of the twelve hours, when the mechanism arises suddenly, it is the primordial *qi*—do not underestimate it. If one can gather it in time, it is indeed the supreme treasure. The ancient sages who obtained it, even if their form and spirit were not yet full, used it to refine and complete the outer defenses, or to cultivate the yellow chamber of the spirit-room, and so on.\"*\n\nThis teaching has been repeatedly and thoroughly presented by Yang Lin of my lineage. All fellow practitioners may study and ponder it.\n\nAs for the true arising of *zi*-*yang* and the obtaining of the great medicine, this is not a fixed doctrine. Taixu says: *\"When encounter and response coincide, and the body is fundamentally in utmost emptiness, at the time of profound stillness, then what is obtained is immeasurable, and what arises is unfathomable. If one is not yet empty and still, or merely empty but not still, there is absolutely no principle by which one may obtain it.\"*\n\nThus, whenever I speak of the method of observing return, I invariably emphasize the two oral instructions: *\"Utmost emptiness\"* and *\"profound stillness.\"* How many truly understand this instruction? Now that I am old and may soon return to emptiness, if this instruction is not transmitted to the world, it will be like a lion without fur, roaring soundlessly—would this not be a great regret? Therefore, I have clarified and revised the discussion of the term *\"time\"* in this section, adding annotations here. May those who encounter this treasure it and embody it.\n\nThe *Elixir Classics* say: *\"Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear; earth obtains the One and becomes tranquil; humans obtain the One and attain longevity.\"* This primordial unity of *qi* emerges from the midst of emptiness and nothingness—yet it is not the same as the complete emptiness of the void. To guard stillness to its utmost in emptiness and nothingness, dwelling in the midst of indistinct obscurity, with the great primordial unity settled, the spirit naturally arrives. The singular numen remains ever serene—this is the true primordial, empty yet not empty.\n\nMin Xiaogen says: *\"I note that this primordial is not merely the primordial of the individual body; it is the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate. It is not the *qi* of two aspects, empty and full, and thus it is empty yet not empty.\"*\n\nIn my humble opinion: *\"This primordial\"* refers to the *qi* of the Great Ultimate; *\"yet it is not\"* refers to the *qi* that flows forth in the Three Powers. Now, in describing the method of practice, it speaks of attaining stillness in emptiness—its meaning is profoundly subtle. For emptiness is the substance, and stillness is the practice. Without stillness, one cannot obtain it; without stillness in emptiness, one cannot attain its fullness. I fear that practitioners may suspect this contradicts the previously annotated methods, and thus I have taken up my brush to clarify it.\n\nAs for the ancestral *qi* of the Great Ultimate, it may serve as the mother; the flowing *qi* of the Great Ultimate may serve as nourishment—both belong to the great medicine, yet they differ. The Great Ultimate is what gives rise to the two aspects, while this ancestral *qi* is what the Great Ultimate itself emerges from. It can form the embryo, and thus is called the mother. The flowing *qi* is the *qi* emitted within the Great Ultimate by the Three Powers. In creation, it is primordial; in the Dao, it is posterior. Among these, the clear and turbid are not uniform, and they can only be gathered for nurturing—thus it is said to serve as nourishment.

      "translated_text": "The Ren channel carries yang water, which is the *qi* of emptiness and clarity, while the Gui channel carries yin water, which is the substance of matured medicine. Daoist alchemists favor yang and disfavor yin, for Gui water is what the Dao of the Elixir abhors. Thus, the true yang that arises possesses *qi* but no substance—it is the *qi* of pure yang. If delayed even slightly, substance will form! Once substance forms, it becomes Gui water—how could such a heavy and turbid thing reverse its flow and ascend? This is why Ancestor Master Ziyang had the oral instruction: *\"When lead encounters Gui’s birth, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit to taste.\"*\n\nWhenever \"Gui’s birth\" is spoken of, it is out of fear that it will arise, not out of delight in its arising. Do not mistakenly take Gui’s birth for yang’s birth—only then will it be wondrous. Once yang has arisen, one must immediately use true intention to draw it into the Central Palace, where it unites with the true yin within Li. This is the initial work of the dragon and tiger’s mating.\n\n[Min Xiaogen says: The discourse on the Dao of the Elixir favoring yang and abhorring clarity is indeed an unassailable, immutable principle. Yet if one’s aim is merely to nourish life, even if the timing is missed, it need not be discarded—there is another method of practice. After breaking through the summit, one may simply allow it to disperse throughout the body, forgetting form to nurture *qi*. Then, when a cool sensation reaches the heart, it transforms into true yin, flowing through the four limbs, returning to the hundred meridians, and moistening the sinews and joints. This is also a wondrous method for cultivating and supplementing the physical body, though one must strictly guard against retaining it in the palace, where it would turn into the \"drink of clouds.\"\n\nMaster Taixu spoke of this for elderly Dao learners, saying it resembles the \"returning and restoring method\" mentioned by the Perfected One Shi Xinglin.

      "translated_text": "The *Classic of the Elixir* states: \"The dragon emerges from fire,\" meaning the dragon is born within *li*. It further says: \"The tiger is born in water,\" meaning the tiger is born within *kan*. The method of elixir refinement proceeds thus: at the outset, the dragon is summoned to the tiger; subsequently, the tiger responds to the dragon. When emptiness reaches its utmost and stillness its deepest, simply settle the original spirit into the *qi*-cavern, allowing it to breathe of its own accord—no deliberate action may be taken, nor any intention of seeking achievement entertained. One must remain leisurely and at ease, without attachment, lest disharmony arise; only then does it accord with the spirit’s function. Over time, the breath need not be regulated, for harmony arises naturally. If one must rise and move, one must first close the eyes and sit in stillness, allowing it to return to its original cavern, and only arise once complete tranquility is attained. Take heed, take heed! Should one be compelled to rise due to unavoidable circumstances, once the matter is resolved, one must resume the prior practice—this too is a method of adjustment.\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: The passage beginning \"at the outset\" corresponds to the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*’s \"true earth captures true lead\"; the passage beginning \"subsequently\" corresponds to \"true lead restrains true mercury\"; the passage beginning \"simply settle\" corresponds to \"lead and mercury return to true earth\"; and the passage beginning \"allowing it\" corresponds to \"body and mind remain still and unmoving.\" The essential principles of elixir refinement are fully encompassed here! Those who have not yet understood the dragon and tiger must seek the guidance of an enlightened teacher to recognize that these are metaphors for the unrefined body and mind. The key oral instructions in this section lie in the two instances of \"allowing\": first, \"no deliberate action may be taken,\" and second, \"breathing must not be intentional\"—these are the utmost cautions. The phrases \"one must,\" \"may not,\" \"lest it give rise to,\" and \"only then does it accord\" convey such earnest admonition! Yet fearing that the seeker may be overly eager for results, the text further advises \"over time,\" and so on. We who study these texts must aim for clarity and understanding—how can we pass over them carelessly? All learners in the world suffer from this flaw.

      "translated_text": "Beginning forty-nine days before the Winter Solstice, one must first devote effort in advance, so that the solitary yang revives beneath the five yins. With this primordial qi, one transforms the postnatal spirit into a yang spirit—this is a rare method in the world, its subtlety beyond easy description!\n\nHowever, during the foundational stage, the work of cultivating the medicine and gathering the great medicine each has its distinctions; they must not be practiced indiscriminately. Only then can one be called a true adept of our Dao!\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: This preliminary effort is precisely the practice of self-mastery. For in cultivating the supreme Dao, one must first open the mysterious aperture; if this aperture remains closed, progress in practice is nearly impossible. Yet it is not through mere circulation that this opening occurs—it must be aided by self-mastery. When the mind is purified of extraneous thoughts, the will becomes singular; with the will and thoughts thus unified, the mysterious aperture naturally opens wide. My master, Tai Xu, has explained this in detail.\n\nNevertheless, fearing that some may harbor expectations of quick results, I reluctantly mention the forty-nine-day period. Let the learner examine themselves: if the heart is not yet pure, why not begin at the Summer Solstice? Or even at the Winter Solstice of the previous year? This aligns with the first chapter’s principle of \"the longer the accumulation, the better\"—it is not a rigidly fixed schedule.\n\nThe distinctions between cultivating the medicine and gathering the great medicine have already been clarified above; I will not repeat them here. Yet there remains a great doubt, seldom addressed in ancient or modern alchemical texts, and even this book does not discuss it—how many aspirants have been misled by it! Knowing this, I dare not leave it unexamined.\n\nTake, for instance, Master Bai Ziqing’s *On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*, a text recited by all in our lineage. Yet how many recite it without truly grasping its meaning? What is this doubt? It lies in the single word \"gathering.\"\n\nThose who do not understand the body merely skim the text like a galloping horse viewing flowers—they do not even question the word, let alone discern its meaning. But for those who seek true realization, they may mistake it for deliberate action, blindly seeking and erring, falling into the path of laborious effort, and casting this discourse aside. How tragic!\n\nDoes the *Treatise* not state: \"Take the body as the crucible, the heart as mercury, stability as water, and wisdom as fire\"? And further: \"Use essence, spirit, soul, and intent as medicinal ingredients; take movement, stillness, sitting, and lying as the firing times; employ clarity and naturalness as the method of operation.\" Regarding the refining process, it says: \"Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; the heart as the chamber of spirit; seated meditation as the gathering; mindful observation as the firing; starting and stopping as advancing and retreating; interruption and distraction as embankments; operation as drawing and adding; true qi’s steaming as bathing; calming thoughts as nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind as field combat; concentrating spirit and gathering qi as defending the city; forgetting scheming and severing concerns as life and death; the movement of thought as the mysterious female; forging into a single mass as union; returning to the root and restoring life as the elixir’s completion; transferring spirit as changing the vessel; having a body beyond the body as rebirth; returning to the origin as the true teaching; and shattering emptiness as fulfillment.\"\n\nHow clear this is! Gathering occurs solely in seated meditation—if this doubt remains unresolved, one may err as far as north from south. A lifetime of practice may yield no result, dismissed as lacking fortune, which is truly lamentable.\n\nI urge all fellow aspirants: first embody the word \"cultivate.\" Though the vehicles may be three, the essential method of gathering remains singular.]\n\n**Third: The Union of Kan and Li**\n\nOnce the foundation-building of the cultivator of truth proves effective, one must not slacken but continue as before: regulating the breath through the nose, sealing the tongue’s qi, concentrating the ears’ resonance, and closing the valley passage. The four images harmonize and return to emptiness. One must ensure the body and mind remain unmoving, drawing the postnatal spirit back to the place of the true person’s breath, guarding it without loss, and uniting it with qi. Naturally, one reaches the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness.\n\nSuddenly, one feels a subtle stirring at the sea bottom, and light shines through, resembling a new moon hanging in the southwest—like the moon on the third day rising in the geng direction, this is the initial appearance of metal qi. Within Kan, a single point of warm qi surges upward to the heart’s ruler. With intention, one guides it downward along the yellow path, passing through the tail gate, traversing the spine’s bridge, piercing the jade pillow, entering the muddy pellet, and roaming the nine palaces. From above, it descends, warm like dripping water, fragrant as awakening nectar, sweet as dew. The eyes send it into emptiness, the mind welcomes it into nothingness, and it naturally returns to the inner point—this is the marvel of the union of Kan and Li.\n\n[Min Xiaogen notes: This return method is the initial practice of fetal breathing. The statement \"after reaching extreme emptiness and profound stillness, light shines through the curtains, resembling a new moon\" follows conventional teachings, though it may not always be so. Sometimes it appears as a millet grain or a pearl, but it always manifests in the abdomen—whether called the kun position or geng direction, it merely signifies the initial appearance of metal qi.\n\nThe claim that \"a single point of warm qi surges to the heart\" is also not fixed; one must guide it downward with intention. As for the original text’s \"passing through the tail gate via the yellow path to the jade pillow,\" this is a grave error, surely a corruption or omission. (I have) thus amended it to \"via the yellow path through the tail gate,\" adding \"traversing the spine’s bridge, piercing the jade pillow, and entering the muddy pellet.\"\n\nFor the human body has three paths: black, red, and yellow. The yellow path ascends straight along the seam between the kidneys in front and the navel behind; it rises along the seam between the spine in front and the heart behind, directly piercing the muddy pellet. The red path ascends in reverse along the green path, joins the black, and follows the yellow upward to the niwan, then again joins the black and follows the yellow to return to the cinnabar field. The black path, starting from the sea, joins the red and follows the yellow in reverse, piercing the tail gate to reach the pillow, then from the niwan joins the red and follows the yellow along the forehead to the pond, descending to the cinnabar field and returning to the sea.]",

      "translated_text": "These three paths follow such courses, yet few in the world know the origin of their names—truly, they are the Three Treasures of body, heart, and intent. The heart pertains to *Qian*; *Qian*’s fundamental position lies in *Li*, whose color is red, hence the name “red path,” which is in fact the *Ren* meridian of the body. The nature of *Ren* is to blaze upward, yet in practice one must cause it to descend. The body pertains to *Kun*; *Kun*’s fundamental position lies in *Kan*, whose color is black, hence the name “black path,” which is in fact the *Du* meridian of the body. The nature of *Du* is to moisten downward, yet in practice one must cause it to ascend—this is called “inverting Yin and Yang,” for *Du* is Yang while *Ren* is Yin. As for the names *Du* and *Ren*, their meaning is drawn from *Qian*’s strength and *Kun*’s compliance.\n\nIntent pertains to Earth, whose color is yellow, hence the name “yellow path.” Such is the conventional explanation, though the profound meaning within is not easily exhausted. For instance, the *Classic* refers to the red and black as the “human path” and to the yellow as the “immortal path”—how could one fail to fathom its purport?\n\nYour disciple Yanglin’s exegesis of *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* is most detailed and lucid. His explanation states: “*Kan* is the body, *Li* is the heart, and the foundation of *Kan* and *Li* is intent. In the prior heavens, *Kan* resides in the West as *po*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the North, where *po* has already flowed into essence—now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging essence and *po* into one household is the body. In the prior heavens, *Li* resides in the East as *hun*; in the posterior heavens, it resides in the South, where *hun* has already manifested as spirit—now, uniting prior and posterior heavens and merging spirit and *hun* into one household is the heart. Only Earth, dwelling at the center and uniting the Four Symbols, is the true foundation of *Kan* and *Li* in both prior and posterior heavens—unchanged by the shift between them, this is intent. When Earth is raised to house the body and gather the heart, causing body, heart, and intent to merge into one place, undivided and unceasing, nurturing the true to achieve abundance and the power to generate beings—is this not the state where all things are complete within me and the Three Realms return to this single body?”\n\nSuch is his explanation, which, when applied to comprehend the three paths, makes their nature as clear as pointing to the palm of one’s hand.\n\nMaster Lü said: “To cultivate the immortal path, first perfect the human path; without cultivating the human path, the immortal path remains distant.” Master Niwan stated: “The immortal path and the human path lie nowhere beyond this body.” Yet世人误会, seeking explanations outside the body, find no place to begin. For they are ignorant of the principle that the red and black constitute the human, and only when the human is purified and returns to white can one revert to the yellow.\n\nMaster Taixu said: “The sagely work of the elixir path lies in nothing beyond return and reversion.” To embody the red and black is to emerge from *Li* and *Kan*; the task of learning and reversion must begin with the refining of *Li* and *Kan*, striving to return the posterior to the prior, transforming the mundane into the sagely. Yet the common flaw among learners lies in haste, often skipping stages to advance, leading to errors such as “disturbing the yellow” and arousing doubt.\n\nI have elaborated on this in my annotations to *The Heart Transmission of Heavenly Immortals*. Fellow cultivators may consult it to understand that I did not devise this teaching lightly. This text contains many profound principles and is indeed a rare work for elixir path practitioners. Unfortunately, through repeated transcription, errors such as miswritten characters and missing phrases have arisen. Without correction, faults like “disturbing the yellow” may occur, with no small consequences.\n\nThough I have now emended the text, I have not expounded its profound principles in detail, and later learners may still struggle to follow it, potentially hindering their progress—this must be considered. I have also changed the character “pass” (*guo*) to “pierce” (*tou*) in “piercing the jade pillow,” for this jade pillow is a narrow and bony passage, also called the “iron wall.” If later learners have not yet transformed it and forcibly attempt to cross and descend, they will inevitably suffer the harm of “disturbing the yellow”—minor cases result in brain swelling, major cases in brain injury—its perils are severe and must not be ignored.\n\nThe phrase below, “the eyes send off and the intent welcomes,” refers to gathering the heart and eyes together into emptiness and nothingness.

      "translated_text": "Master Xue said: *\"The moon’s fullness depends on oral transmission; the mystery of the midnight hour lies in heart-to-heart instruction.\"* He also said: *\"The breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers; the jade clepsydra’s chill drips in perfect accord.\"* This is the orally transmitted method of the celestial orbit’s fire phases.\n\nThus the Perfected One of Emerald Emptiness said:\n*\"When the myriad winds first stir,\nAnd the thousand peaks’ moon stands full,\nHasten to issue the true command—\nThen may you set the celestial orbit in motion.\"*\nThese lines cite Master Shi’s words to validate Master Xue’s oral instructions, teaching one to practice in natural alignment with its secret essence.\n\nMaster of Hengyang observed: *\"In all elixir-refining, when fire is kindled at the true midnight hour as yang qi arises, the fire’s power is complete—at no other time is this so. For at the exact midnight hour, the Great Yang resides in the north, precisely when one’s qi reaches the Weilu Pass. At this moment, fire is kindled just as the body’s yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir. When the true midnight hour of heaven and earth coincides with the living midnight hour within the body, inner and outer unite—only then is the wondrous mechanism of heaven and human joined in perfect accord, fully stealing the creative power of heaven and earth to form the elixir.\"* His explanation is most clear and accurate. Though those who attain this may not always follow it strictly, it still serves to elucidate Master Xue’s heart-transmitted secret instructions.\n\nRegarding the numbers of the celestial orbit, he held that from *zi* to *si*—the six yang positions corresponding to Qian’s tally—total two hundred sixteen counts. Subtracting the thirty-six counts of *mao* yang (used for bathing and ceasing fire), one actually practices one hundred eighty counts. From *wu* to *hai*—the six yin positions corresponding to Kun’s tally—total one hundred forty-four counts. Subtracting the twenty-four counts of *you* yin (used for bathing and halting the tally), one actually practices one hundred twenty counts. Together these make three hundred breaths. Including the bathing periods, the total reaches three hundred sixty breaths, with an intercalary remainder of twenty-four counts, making three hundred eighty-four breaths. This interpretation of *\"the breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers\"* is indeed precise and detailed. Yet if one is instructed to count these breaths attentively during practice, the advancing fire may become too vigorous and cumbersome, while the retreating tally may grow disordered and lose its harmony—how is this different from entangling silk? Does it not diverge from Bai Ziqing’s method of advancing, retreating, withdrawing, and adding fire, along with bathing?\n\nOne must recognize that Master Xue, having said *\"the breaths of the celestial orbit are counted in the subtlest of numbers,\"* immediately followed with *\"the jade clepsydra’s chill drips in perfect accord\"*—to awaken the practitioner to the foundational technique, originally teaching one to align the breath-count with the celestial orbit through spiritual movement. As Bai Ziqing said, this is the method of *\"using quiescence and naturalness as the means of operation.\"* Zhang Ziyang’s words—*\"Fire phases do not depend on time; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*. As for the bathing method, it is likened to the emptiness of *mao* and *you*\"*—express the same principle.\n\nThus, all original diagrams, explanations, and trivial details—such as nasal inhalation, swallowing, palm depressions, and wheel positions—have been entirely excised to avoid obstructing the practitioner’s mind and vision. The student, upon reaching this stage, need only silently contemplate and circulate the words *\"subtlest, drip by drip\"*—naturally, intention will not leak, and one will feel only the interdependence of heart and breath, the breath harmonized and the heart stilled. This is the moment when the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir is accomplished!\n\nMaster Xue further said:\n*\"The sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire;\nFew have ever known the fire phases.\nDo not treat the fire phases as child’s play—\nWith the immortals, you must ponder them carefully.\"*\nThis shows that the reason the fire was not transmitted is precisely to prevent practitioners from becoming ensnared by its explanations, thereby hindering the fire phases. Hence he said: *\"Do not treat it as child’s play; you must ponder it carefully.\"*\n\nThe practitioner must understand that the medicine is the fire, and the fire is the medicine. When one’s body and heart unite in gathering, it is called the medicine; when body and heart merge wondrously in concentration, deliberately preserving the Great Harmony, it is called the fire. How can one mistake inhaling celestial winds, swallowing earthly fluids, pinching palm positions, or moving through the palaces as the fire phases of the celestial orbit? This would be like counting sand or disturbing the true intent—would it not violate the warning against treating the fire phases as child’s play? Our school’s scholars must discern this clearly.\n\n[Min Xiaogen says: By the middle ages of the world, bodies with unbroken true yang were already rare. Thus the three chapters of practice—*Kan-Li intercourse, gathering the medicine and returning it to the crucible, and the fire phases of the celestial orbit*—were established for the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir. These serve only to replenish the postnatal leakage of yang essence, yang qi, and yang spirit, restoring them to the state of a virgin body. If one hears the Dao in youth and is willing to begin practice, first refining the self and laying the foundation, then the intercourse of Qian and Kun can proceed—this is the supreme vehicle, the highest-grade direct elixir method. In the absence of such individuals, this middle-grade elixir method of three chapters must be inserted into the highest-grade method to mend postnatal deficiencies, making one identical to a virgin in truth. Only then can one proceed to the following practice of Qian-Kun intercourse.

      "translated_text": "**6. The Intercourse of Qian and Kun**\n\nFrom the three preceding methods of practice, once Kan and Li have conjoined to form the medicine, and the medicine is gathered into the crucible to circulate the fire, when the fire’s revolution reaches completion, the positions of the primordial Qian and Kun are established. From this point onward, one must not seek through form or appearance. Instead, empty the heart to attain the utmost emptiness, solidify the abdomen to uphold the deepest stillness, and with sincerity within, inwardly observe one’s return—naturally attaining profound and unwavering stability. Pure and refined in essence, the mechanism stirs abruptly, and suddenly, the self and the existing forms of heaven and earth vanish. One only perceives luminous clarity, boundless and infinite. At the first moment of awareness, swiftly gather it in, and instantly enter profound quiescence, merging into the aperture—dim and obscure, unknowing and unperceiving, soundless and odorless. This is the great opening of the mysterious pass, the deep entry into the singular aperture. After a time, a single point descends into the Yellow Court, and this is the return of the primordial qi, naturally circulating through the six voids. Only then does one realize that this body is originally the altar, crucible, and furnace; the heart is the chamber of spirit, and within it, I am but a single true intention. One feels the qi fresh and the spirit clear, the body harmonious and the heart at ease, while heaven and earth, sun and moon remain soft as silk—this is the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. One only perceives a radiant, rounded luminosity, like an original pearl resting on a crystal plate, yet in truth, it is formless and imageless. This is what the sages call \"the solitary revelation of numinous emptiness,\" and what the former master described as \"Qian and Kun merging to perfect my Great Ultimate.\"\n\nAt this stage, the adept must guard the subtle with utmost care, washing the heart and retiring into secrecy, thoughtless and effortless, naturally empty yet inexhaustible—this is the method of the ten-month gestation. As Bai Ziqing said: \"A moment’s coagulation, ten months’ gestation—no hexagrams, no weight.\" The method is simple and easy, yet only the superior adept can practice it; herein lies the ease of attainment.\n\n**7. The Ten-Month Gestation**\n\nOnce the numinous elixir has returned to the chamber of spirit, as the ancients said: \"The elixir crucible and river chariot rest from toil, while the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath flow gently on.\" Wang Chongyang said: \"Once the sacred embryo is congealed, nurture it with the gentle fire, settle the spirit and regulate the breath, letting it be natural.\" The Elder of Zhengyang said: \"No need to tend the fire—within the crucible, it is warm of itself.\" The Patriarch of Apricot Grove said: \"Refining qi is labor in vain; preserving spirit is effort wasted. How could one know the marvel of the elixir’s secret? Daylong, one plays with true emptiness.\" All these are the true oral instructions for gestation.\n\nThough one may have obtained the great medicine, with the five colors appearing, the common practitioner calls this the formation of the embryo, yet it has not undergone transformation. Thus, the immortal master said: \"The treasure in the cinnabar field is not the true treasure; only the re-congealed numinous embryo is the sacred embryo.\" After obtaining the elixir, the ten-month gestation begins. From this point onward, one must diligently tend to it at every moment, guarding it ceaselessly, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding its egg, ensuring the warmth never ceases, so that the numinous embryo gradually solidifies. The essence is gentle warmth—thoughts must not arise, for their arising stokes the fire; intention must not scatter, for its scattering cools the fire. One must avoid excess or deficiency, maintaining only the crucible’s gentle warmth—there is no other method. Any contrivance invites immediate danger. Be cautious! Be cautious!\n\nThroughout the ten months of practice, from beginning to end, one must remain as if in a single day, at every moment preserving the state before the seven emotions arise and at every instant safeguarding the body before the eight consciousnesses are defiled. Only thus can one refine and cultivate it to achieve the perfection of spirit and the transformation of the embryo. If the elixir fire grows hot, visualize a black sphere the size of a bowl between the brows, gather it into the chamber of spirit, and the heat will subside—this must not be forgotten.\n\n**8. Moving the Spirit and Changing the Crucible**\n\nOnce the ten-month gestation is complete, the qi is full and the spirit whole, and the infant manifests its form. Emerging from the womb, one may then move the spirit and change the crucible. The Ancestor Qiu of Everlasting Spring considered this the direct ascent from the central palace to the upper Yellow—the upper Yellow is called the Mud Pill, also known as the Heavenly Valley, the purest realm of the human body.\n\nThis infant is entirely formed of the primordial, not of mundane essence, mundane qi, or mundane spirit. It appears and vanishes at will, can penetrate metal and stone, and leaves no trace. To describe it as an embryo or infant is merely metaphor. Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: \"The *Heart Transmission of the Supreme* speaks of preserving it as an infant—this means one must nurture it as an infant, a compassionate teaching that uses the concrete to verify the empty.\" Yet Master Duanyang said: \"Once the Dharma-body is congealed, the spirit must be further stabilized.\" Hence the relocation to the Heavenly Valley is not merely for its purity but follows the natural principle. Those who misunderstand its intent speak of concealment and manifestation, appearing and disappearing. The adept must remain in serene stability, rightly positioned within the body, undeluded by the soul or spirit, so that inner and outer are luminously clear.\n\nXiao Zixu said: \"Moving the spirit to the Heavenly Valley is precisely for refining the nature. When the Three Flowers gather at the crown and the Five Qi converge at the void, there may be a moment of myriad distractions, yet one who can remain steadfast in non-action is stabilized by wisdom, and thus the mechanism attains spontaneous quiescence. However, few learners preserve tranquility, often disturbed by the esoteric teachings of alchemical schools regarding the manifestation of the yang spirit.\" Thus, the Patriarch Xue said: \"The Great Dao is formless—what form or appearance could it have? The Great Dao is nameless—what numinous sageliness could it possess? All these names and titles, these supreme esoteric teachings, are but means to clarify one thing through another, transforming the illusory into the real through marvelous function. Yet the ultimate spiritual achievement lies entirely in refining it when moving the spirit to the Heavenly Valley. Alas, such teachings on the convergence of nature and life have long been lost to the world! Later learners who attain them must not regard the study of nature as unrelated to life. They do not know that the body of refined gold is but the manifestation of the single qi of emptiness and non-being—thus it can instantly vanish or instantly appear.\"",

      "translated_text": "Patriarch Xue further stated: \"Those who can comprehend the profound meaning within the interplay of great movement and great stillness may grasp it in their hearts—do not mix it with conjecture or deliberation. Hold this in awe and proceed with caution.\"\n\n**Chapter Nine: Cultivating Wisdom in the Mud-Pill Palace**\nThe Mud-Pill Palace is the Heavenly Valley of the body, just as the Northern Dipper has its celestial pole, the world has its heavenly axis, and the heavens have the Jade Purity Realm. Once the spirit is moved to the Heavenly Valley, there is no other method—any admixture of contrivance immediately plunges one into illusion and delusion, as the ancient sages have thoroughly explained. The only practice is to still the mind and enter quiescent concentration.\n\nFor humans, though they dwell in form within the world, the true self has not yet transformed, and the true spirit is not yet complete. They cannot yet return to the celestial pole like the stars, nor attain the threefold purity of the heavens, for they remain ununified with the heavenly axis. The heavenly axis is without self, yet the self still clings to selfhood. The celestial pole star is formed of the great mass of true gold—massive yet not merely mass, thus it can align with the celestial mind, transforming as it arises.\n\nWhen we refine the Golden Elixir, it relies entirely on the true Dharma-body of the self and the congealing of the true spirit. Once the great primordial essence is transformed and ascends to dwell in the Heavenly Valley, it must correspond to the celestial axis to align with Heaven. The axis universally illuminates the Three Powers, and so too should I. Yet at first, I only illuminate the Three Powers within this single body. If one does not forget both inner and outer, attaining effortless selflessness, how can one penetrate the Three Realms, follow Heaven in every place, maintain unity in movement and stillness, and remain undivided in gathering and dispersing? This is certainly beyond the reach of those lacking spiritual wisdom, nor can those who rely solely on spiritual wisdom preserve it forever.\n\nThus, Patriarch Xue said: \"Pure Yang once declared, *'Model Heaven and emulate Earth'*—how easily is this spoken! Without attaining the utmost emptiness and profound stillness, one can hardly dwell in the world while transcending it. Yet those who achieve this do so precisely through tempering within the world—what is called *cultivating wisdom in stillness and refining wisdom in movement.*\"\n\nMaster Apricot Grove commented: \"Only fearing that one cannot see through or let go, hence the need for further refinement.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, the method of refinement ultimately lies in nothing but *sincerity*. Sincerity is not merely perfecting oneself but also perfecting others. Thus, sincerity in stillness brings clarity to the spirit, and sincerity in movement brings transparency to one’s nature. When nature is transparent, the spirit naturally attains great stability, and there is nothing in the world one cannot let go of. When the spirit is luminous, nature becomes perfectly penetrating, and there is no principle in the world one cannot see through. This is truly the reverent knowledge of attainment and the sincerity of intention—where the rectification of the mind and the cultivation of the body arise spontaneously, as echo follows sound. This is the true secret of cultivating and refining wisdom.\n\nHere, one cannot know through knowledge, nor perceive through perception, nor divine through divinity. Only by stabilizing the non-divinity of the self does one attain the inherent nature of self-illumination through sincerity. There is destiny, yet the noble person does not act for nature alone—this is the function of refining the spirit. Advancing toward the return to emptiness is founded upon this!\n\n**Chapter Ten: Refining the Spirit to Return to Emptiness**\nStillness gives rise to wisdom, and within stillness lies the movement of ultimate quiescence—the marvel of emptiness that does not bend and movement that ever emerges. Through this, one attains great wisdom and possesses great spiritual powers. Yet if one remains in constant movement without returning, how can wisdom be preserved, and how can the spirit not grow weary? Thus, the patriarchs also transmitted the method of refining the spirit to return to emptiness.\n\nThis method lies in embracing the solitary joy of tranquil observation amid all activity. Within this vast and boundless body and world, the qi-mechanisms within are ever hidden and manifest, yet all are one with me. Observe the common people—though they dwell within it, they are as tiny as a grain, drifting with the world. I alone embody the true and constant, responding to things as they come, neither resisting nor neglecting them. The hidden and manifest seven emotions and eight consciousnesses of the common people are but the pervading qi of Brahma. I alone possess my boundless primordial essence, melting and dissolving until even emptiness is shattered.\n\nYet when one realizes that self and others are one continuum, all ride the Six Qi in ceaseless circulation. Saints and mortals share the same Heaven, with no distinction between form and spirit. Entrusted with the mandate of transforming the earth into Heaven, I do not grasp its power. Responding to the qi-mechanisms of spiritual transformation, I do not seek its effects. Like the sun and moon, which illuminate all without partiality, they have no intent—thus they remain eternally bright through all ages, undiminished through countless kalpas. This is what is meant by *refining* and *returning*—nothing more.\n\nTo speak of refining and returning is still to borrow a method. The adept who returns to emptiness may, like one who has caught the fish, forget the trap.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Refining Emptiness to Merge with the Dao**\nThe previous stage of returning to emptiness has reached the state where self and others are undivided, yet the distinction between self and others still lingers. If this perception is not eradicated, self-mastery remains incomplete. One must advance further beyond the hundred-foot pole.\n\nThe patriarchs also transmitted the method of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao. Only through this can one truly unite with the Dao. For this world and this body are ultimately illusory shadows—visible and audible. If one does not shatter this emptiness, the deluded view of this as real and that as empty, or this as empty and that as real, will persist. As long as this view remains, one can hardly avoid the peril of erosion. Upon encountering worldly conflicts, one will again fall into the dust and turmoil. *\"Restless comings and goings, following the thoughts of companions\"*—how can one extinguish thoughts and forget emotions?\n\nThe method lies in forgetting both reality and illusion, yielding entirely to spontaneity, thereby naturally merging with the Dao. To speak of *refining* is only to *\"shatter emptiness\"*—in that instant, the Dao merges with the natural. This Dao is like the great thoroughfare of Jambudvīpa, traversed by all beings—what is called *\"the royal road is smooth as whetstone, straight as an arrow.\"* The only hindrance is dim eyes, weak feet, or an unfocused will—how could one fail to reach the ultimate?",

Alas, such teachings on the convergence of nature and life have long been lost to the world! Later learners who attain them must not regard the study of nature as unrelated to life. They do not know that the body of refined gold is but the manifestation of the single qi of emptiness and non-being—thus it can instantly vanish or instantly appear.\"",

      "translated_text": "Alas, the world has lost the Dao, and people lack the single eye of discernment. Worse still, they are misled by false teachers and blind peddlers who point to crooked paths and offer misleading staffs—some even travel south while aiming north. The Most High, moved by compassion, brought forth Master Li of Hengyang to expound these stages of Golden Elixir practice. Yet again, Dao-peddlers have stolen the truth, mixed it with falsehood, and deceived the world for private gain.\n\nLittle do they know that this Dao resides in the human heart, transcending the Three Teachings and all sects. Everyone possesses an indestructible innate knowing and innate ability, directly aligned with the Most High’s mind-to-mind transmission. Hengyang traces its lineage to the Southern School yet humbly inherits the Northern School—both branches of Ancestral Master Lü’s tradition. Master and disciple share one family; how could their words differ?\n\nUpon encountering this text, I lamented its mixture of truth and forgery. Thus, I have mended and compiled it, as if awakening in the same chamber where voices resonate in unison. I intend to bestow it upon later learners, answering the call of those who share the same qi. May future students receive this mind-to-mind transmission free from doubts of borrowed names or metaphors, and without the traces of exhausting the spirit or straining the body.\n\nWith a settled and tranquil mind, one directly perceives the original nature. With not a single thought arising, the wheel of rebirth ceases. The dust-like evil karma of eons dissolves with each thought. Equal to all beings, one attains the fruit of purity—how direct, how joyous! What fear could prevent one from immediately embracing this?\n\nWhen practice reaches its culmination, one naturally receives and returns in full. Like the Yellow Emperor losing and regaining his pearl, or Master Zeng lifting his hands and feet in completion, all fulfill this single move of refining emptiness.\n\nDisciples of the Three Teachings should now suddenly understand!\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Merging with the Dao in Truth**\nWhen practice advances to refining emptiness and merging with the Dao, no further effort can be applied. Measured by one’s learning, this is the point where the sage knows destiny.\n\nIn effortless harmony with the mean, from the world’s perspective, speech becomes hexagrams, silence becomes images. In movement, one moves with Heaven; in stillness, one roams with Heaven. Naturally, eight hundred merits are perfected, three thousand deeds fulfilled—like Confucius acting from the heart’s desire, Yao and Shun governing by desire, Mencius’ \"heavenly people,\" the Buddha’s \"Great Vehicle Golden Immortals,\" or our tradition’s \"Highest-Grade Heavenly Immortals.\"\n\nActing in the world, the nation is governed and the world is at peace. In action, one becomes the world’s Dao; in conduct, the world’s model; in speech, the world’s standard. From afar, one is revered; up close, never resented.\n\nIn spiritual realization of the Great Void, one sustains and bears all without exception, covers and shelters all without limit—nurturing the myriad things without harm, circulating through the six directions without control. One moves in unison with Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing cycles, yet does not share their flaws, obscurities, or vicissitudes.\n\nAs my teacher said: \"One gallops alongside Fuxi, stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.\" In truth, one merges with Fuxi and the Primordial Beginning into boundlessness!\n\nOriginally, this chapter was titled *Awaiting the Imperial Summons for Ascension*, speaking of accumulating merit and deeds to await the celestial decree, the arrival of phoenix and crane, and the ascent of flying transcendence. Such views are narrow, reflecting only the effects of middle- and lower-grade elixir completion, insufficient to attest to the highest-grade elixir method. Thus, I have amended it. May scholars not doubt this.",
