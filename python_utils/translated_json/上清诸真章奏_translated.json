the Three Contracts of the Supreme Clarity Pace-Void**\nFrom the beginning, the Cavern-Void is empty,\nThe Three Blacks ascend to the gate of essence.\nPurple wings gleam in the Great Void,\nThe Four Illuminations plant the root of spirit.\nWondrous transformation blooms in the Eastern Jade,\nThe Three Conveniences open the Western Kun.\nRadiant and bright, the Nine Mysteries’ essence,\nFive Florets girded with brocade clouds.\nDeparting the net, the divine lamp shines,\nThe Seven Stars illuminate the Northern Origin.\nFloating, floating, ascending to the Dharma precincts,\nWing to wing, the Imperial Unity is revered.\nLofty, lofty, the exalted hymn,\nHow the feathered youths swarm!\nFlowing fragrance is without color,\nYet it enters the myriad immortals’ throng.\nLeftward, the Three Kalpas revolve,\nRightward, the Ten Thousand Arrows’ pass turns.\nCloud florets tassel the Five Clouds,\nEight Phoenixes dance in the wheel of space.\nThe Four Seasons never halt their mechanism,\nBlue and white are early distinguished.\nNine nines alter the kalpa’s fate,\nThree threes traverse one cycle.\nHeaven and Earth have their final meeting,\nAdversity and stimulus return to the banner.\nThe Cavern Illumination’s Orthodox Unity Dharma,\nSolemnly concludes the Six Heavens’ patterns.\nGreat Peace reverts to emptiness and nothingness,\nServing and aiding the Later Sage Lord.\n\nThe divine wind rises at the Western Gate,\nBrocade clouds arise from the Eastern Jade.\nThe Two Qi gleam upon the Jade Isle,\nFlowing fragrance rides the mist, light.\nFive Florets unfurl in the wind,\nIn an instant, the Nine Clarities shine bright.\nThe Kun Forest glows with the Vermilion Sun,\nYellow Florets follow the moon’s birth.\nWithin, the herb-gathering youths,\nClothed in feathers, girded with flying azure.\nThe scenery of ten thousand peaks,\nCarefree, feasting in the green chariot.\nMastering the Nine Void Transmissions,\nTheir motion unfolds without fixed measure.\nLeft, they command the Three Heavens’ patterns,\nRight, they seize the Six Heavens’ hosts.\nThey inspect qi and the Cavern-Void,\nThe celestial degrees align with fate’s tilt.\nKalpas have their own meetings,\nWho laments defeat or success?\nVast waves engulf the cloud’s net,\nThe Six Harmonies leave no trace.\nWhite corpses drift on the long flow,\nLonely souls scatter and fade.\nGrieving this departure and return,\nOnly then is the Orthodox Dharma’s clarity known.\nDevoted study and refined cultivation,\nIn the Eastern Flower, a jade name is forged.\nRejoicing in those of the White Tablet,\nTogether they delight in Great Peace.\n\nThe Cavern Gates turn the celestial net,\nThe Kingly Qi revolves the Three Subtleties.\nPurple portals spew jade tablets,\nGolden gates receive the divine radiance.\nThe Eight Assemblies exchange the true wind,\nBrilliant and bright, the layered darkness opens.\nBeyond the Nine Clarities at heaven’s edge,\nLofty, lofty, the exalted dawn returns.\nThree hues revert to emptiness and nothingness,\nThe Four Seasons respond to the Jade Precincts.\nThe River waits, brush already poised,\nThe Five Phases subtly propel one another.\nThe Six Perfections know no end,\nWhen fate exhausts, they ride qi to return.\nTen thousand demons spread across the heavens,\nHordes of fiends vie to display their might.\nThe multitudes bear calamity’s thrust,\nPiles of corpses move one to sorrow.\nWondrous, the Orthodox Dharma’s patterns,\nTreading kalpas, their brightness never fades.\nAt the destined time, they are welcomed,\nTheir pact at the Nine Heavens’ gates.\nWith you, I await Great Peace,\nReleasing the body to fly wingless.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hymn of the Supreme Clarity Rotating Walk**\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious subtleties,\nThe lofty void encompasses the Three Wheels.\nGolden Immortals open the numinous gates,\nGleaming as if the Nine Heavens divide.\nGreat Florets scatter in the purple void,\nEight Perfected reflect the plain clouds.\nThe Mysterious Mother binds the supreme vow,\nThe Eight Gates of the walking tablet.\nTen thousand blessings converge in the numinous assembly,\nRaising incense, they chant the Lower Origin.\nWondrous recitation moves the Void’s depths,\nAchieving union with the exalted immortals’ throng.\nRotating, they walk and bow to the Cavern-Void,\nKowtowing to the Imperial Lord.\n\n---\n\n#### **Pace-Void Lament and Joy Wisdom Verses**\nI bind my natural qi,\nCongealing and transforming the Purple Phoenix City.\nThe high terrace soars beyond the Nine Ridges,\nTowering and layered, forming flying jade.\nGleaming and falling upon the layered void,\nWinding through the Eight Clarities’ caverns.\nPurple canopies illuminate the cloud palaces,\nFlowing radiance shades the Five Numinous.\nFour directions reach boundless wilds,\nEight qi revolve in round clarity.\nThe whirlwind turns the Great Void,\nThe Seven Luminaries revolve the celestial scriptures.\nTheir motion comes as if without form,\nTheir departure follows transformation’s tilt.\nWithin the Nine Circles’ crossings,\nThe Two Images mutually contend.\nThe Imperial Unity solidifies the Central Origin,\nThe Four Nets do not decline in spirit.\nSouthward, they gather the Flying Sovereign’s treasure,\nNorthward, they array the Broad Cold Court.\nMysterious chambers exchange true meetings,\nVoid songs arise naturally.\nThe Five Thearchs command the numinous banners,\nDemon flags subdue the myriad essences.\nDemons howl from the void’s midst,\nThe Dao-world’s joy knows no end.\nThus, the pure verses arise,\nCelebrating the spirits, delighting in Great Peace.\nWith whom do we pact, and where?\nTen thousand kalpas as one age.\nRevolving ninety thousand kalpas,\nTogether we roam the Purple Phoenix chariot.\n\nThe Void births the Purple Phoenix Terrace,\nJade towers join the Supreme Subtlety.\nThe numinous wind pervades the Eight Assemblies,\nThe Northern Window and Heavenly Gates open.\nAbove, the whistling and singing youths,\nEver chant the turning of decay and decline.\nAt dawn, they ride the luminaries to wander,\nAt dusk, they return with the luminaries.\nThe Two Luminaries unite as one body,\nEver fearing to lose the radiance’s gleam.\nThe Nine Qi do not abide forever,\nHeaven and Earth have their overturning peril.\nThe great kalpa concludes one cycle,\nA hundred and six ride fate’s return.\nVast springs surge from the Nine Ridges,\nThe Great Crow soars at heaven’s verge.\nTen thousand creatures drift on the long flow,\nGazing at the mountains, they find no refuge.\nWailing without bound,\nHow can one not grieve in the heart?\nThe worthy and sagely diligently recite scriptures,\nThus they ride the luminaries to fly.\nAt the destined time, they are welcomed,\nTogether they meet at the Nine Heavens’ gates.\n\nWhen the golden horse’s time is exhausted,\nTen thousand calamities surge and clash.\nNo immortal learners are seen,\nOnly those who weep for the corpses in sorrow.\nAlas, these foolish beings,\nClinging to life, how piteous their lament!\nDispersing sorrow at the Nine Mysteries’ terrace,\nGathering joy in the Great Void.\nHolding pact with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,\nWhistling to summon the Eastern Sea youths.\nFour directions, the Eight Assemblies’ qi,\nThe mysterious motion of the Lang Terrace’s wind.\nThe sun shines on the Western Flower Hall,\nThe mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Void.\nDancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,\nDesolate, the Nine Ridges’ peaks.\nGazing across boundless wilds,\nLooking up to the kalpa’s measure.\nClear songs harmonize with palace and commerce,\nSorrow and joy naturally follow.\nThe Two Paths harmonize in one pact,\nPrinciple’s back turns, yet returns to unity.\nTogether, joy knows no end,\nHolding the beginning, again holding the end.\nDrinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s nectar,\nLooking up to drink from the Flying Flower Sovereign.\nThe numinous melon is fit for feasting,\nIts flavor like the sun and moon’s light.\n\nThe Seven Luminaries stream their fragrant radiance,\nHow could this joy ever be forgotten?\nThe great kalpa has its destined end,\nAs the cycles meet, the Two Symbols incline.\n\nDragon Gate severs the Celestial River,\nThe Three and Five turn against each other in contention.\nThe Crimson Guardian occupies the Eastern Well,\nThe Florid Canopy subdues the morning stars.\n\nDark radiance dims the Eight Wastes,\nFoul qi veils the celestial essence.\nThe Three Officials press upon one another,\nThe Five Peaks lose their steadfast numen.\n\nMyriad plagues surge and clash,\nThe Northern Emperor marshals his demonic hosts.\nThe Eight Principles spread beyond the heavens,\nOnly the Sage Lord can bring clarity.\n\nThis weaves the qi of spontaneity,\nForming the towering Ninefold City.\nGazing from on high, pitying the myriad multitudes,\nSorrow and joy arise therefrom.\n\nMysterious songs disperse the spirit’s cares,\nYet sudden joy gives way to tears.\nAlas for these stubborn folk,\nMiserly with wealth, greedy for sensual glory.\n\nJubilant, they await their fate’s arrival,\nHeedless of calamity that coils around them.\nThe wise and sagacious come from afar,\nDiligently reciting scriptures day and night.\n\nThey venerate emptiness, contemplate the Mysterious Void,\nThus transcending boundless ages.\nIf one can seek the source of the Dao,\nAt the eight seasonal nodes, jade names are offered.\n\nThey shall avoid the disasters of the Nine Luminaries,\nAnd behold for you the Great Peace.\nThe Jade Phoenix discourses on the morning gale,\nThe Purple Terrace illumines the Jade Grove.\n\nFlowing light brushes the Profound Mystery,\nMajestic, it ascends the Nine Yin.\nPurple effulgence scatters crimson clouds,\nFlying mists pursue one another.\n\nThe Seven Treasures shake the jade branches,\nSpiritual beasts gallop through cloudy peaks.\nMyriad immortals ride the void in song,\nDivine winds carry wondrous sounds.\n\nAbove, the Lofty Morning Master,\nWith folded hands, whistles and chants.\nThe Eight Assemblies’ natural countenance,\nTheir descent in emptiness all of orchid-gold.\n\nJade chewing extends the kalpa’s dawn,\nJade nectar disperses through the Centered Heart.\nLuminous pearls sing sacred songs,\nDharma’s presence harmonizes with the clear zither.\n\nJade stanzas reveal the Dao’s ultimate lineage,\nSorrow and joy dissolve the heart’s cares.\nThe Purple Canopy gleams over the Cloud Palace,\nFlowing radiance veils the Five Numinous Ones.\n\nThe Four Directions stretch into boundless wilds,\nThe Eight Qi revolve in perfect clarity.\nThe whirlwind courses through the Great Void,\nThe Seven Luminaries turn the celestial scriptures.\n\nWhen the cycle arrives, it is as if formless,\nWhen the time departs, it follows transformation’s incline.\nWithin the Nine Circles’ intersecting paths,\nThe Two Symbols contend with one another.\n\nThe Primordial Unity of the Emperor stabilizes the Center,\nThe Four Principles do not falter in their numen.\nTo the south, the Flying Sovereign’s treasure is gathered,\nTo the north, the Broad Cold Court is arrayed.\n\nThe Mysterious Chamber hosts the true assembly,\nEmpty songs arise spontaneously.\nThe Five Emperors command the spirit banners,\nDemon standards subdue the myriad essences.\n\nDemons howl from the void,\nYet the Dao-world’s joy knows no end.\nThus I raise these plain verses,\nTo celebrate the gods and rejoice in the Great Peace.\n\nWith whom shall this covenant be made?\nFor ten thousand kalpas as one age.\nRevolving through ninety thousand kalpas,\nTogether we roam the Purple Phoenix’s chariot.\n\nBorn from the void, the Purple Phoenix Terrace,\nJade towers reach the Supreme Subtlety.\nNuminous winds penetrate the Eight Assemblies,\nThe Northern Window and Heavenly Gates swing open.\n\nAbove, whistling and singing youths,\nEver chanting of cycles’ decline and fall.\nAt dawn, they ride the light on their journey,\nAt dusk, they return with the light.\n\nThe Two Radiances unite as one body,\nEver fearful of losing the light’s splendor.\nThe Nine Qi do not abide forever,\nHeaven and earth face perilous incline.\n\nThe great kalpa concludes in one turn,\nThe Hundred Six ride the revolving cycles.\nVast springs surge through the Nine Ridges,\nThe Great Crow soars at heaven’s edge.\n\nMyriad creatures drift on endless currents,\nSeeking the mountains in vain for refuge.\nWailing without bound,\nHow can this not grieve the heart?\n\nThe worthy and sagely diligently recite scriptures,\nThus they ride the light and take flight.\nWhen the time comes, they are welcomed,\nJoining the assembly at the Nine Heavens’ gates.\n\nWhen the golden horse’s hour is spent,\nMyriad plagues surge and clash.\nNo immortal learners are seen,\nOnly those who weep for the dead in sorrow.\n\nAlas for these foolish folk,\nClutching their lives, how bitter their lament!\nDispersing cares on the Ninefold Mystery Terrace,\nGathering joy together with the Great Void.\n\nHolding covenant with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,\nWhistling to summon the Eastern Sea youths.\nFour directions, the Eight Assemblies’ qi,\nThe mysterious motion of the Lang Terrace’s wind.\n\nThe sun shines on the Western Flower Hall,\nThe mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Void.\nDancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,\nDesolate, the Nine Ridges’ peaks.\n\nGazing across boundless wilds,\nLooking up to the kalpa’s measure.\nClear songs harmonize with palace and commerce,\nSorrow and joy naturally follow.\n\nThe Two Paths harmonize in one pact,\nPrinciple’s back turns, yet returns to unity.\nTogether, joy knows no end,\nHolding the beginning, again holding the end.\n\nDrinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s nectar,\nLooking up to drink from the Flying Flower Sovereign.\nThe numinous melon is fit for feasting,\nIts flavor like the sun and moon’s light.\n\nThe Seven Luminaries stream their fragrant radiance,\nHow could this joy ever be forgotten?\nThe great kalpa has its destined end,\nAs the cycles meet, the Two Symbols incline.\n\nDragon Gate severs the Celestial River,\nThe Three and Five turn against each other in contention.\nThe Crimson Guardian occupies the Eastern Well,\nThe Florid Canopy subdues the morning stars.\n\nDark radiance dims the Eight Wastes,\nFoul qi veils the celestial essence.\nThe Three Officials press upon one another,\nThe Five Peaks lose their steadfast numen.\n\nMyriad plagues surge and clash,\nThe Northern Emperor marshals his demonic hosts.\nThe Eight Principles spread beyond the heavens,\nOnly the Sage Lord can bring clarity.\n\nThis weaves the qi of spontaneity,\nForming the towering Ninefold City.\nGazing from on high, pitying the myriad multitudes,\nSorrow and joy arise therefrom.\n\nMysterious songs disperse the spirit’s cares,\nYet sudden joy gives way to tears.\nAlas for these stubborn folk,\nMiserly with wealth, greedy for sensual glory.\n\nJubilant, they await their fate’s arrival,\nHeedless of calamity that coils around them.\nThe wise and sagacious come from afar,\nDiligently reciting scriptures day and night.\n\nThey venerate emptiness, contemplate the Mysterious Void,\nThus transcending boundless ages.\nIf one can seek the source of the Dao,\nAt the eight seasonal nodes, jade names are offered.\n\nThey shall avoid the disasters of the Nine Luminaries,\nAnd behold for you the Great Peace.\nThe Jade Phoenix discourses on the morning gale,\nThe Purple Terrace illumines the Jade Grove.\n\nFlowing light brushes the Profound Mystery,\nMajestic, it ascends the Nine Yin.\nPurple effulgence scatters crimson clouds,\nFlying mists pursue one another.\n\nThe Seven Treasures shake the jade branches,\nSpiritual beasts gallop through cloudy peaks.\nMyriad immortals ride the void in song,\nDivine winds carry wondrous sounds.\n\nAbove, the Lofty Morning Master,\nWith folded hands, whistles and chants.\nThe Eight Assemblies’ natural countenance,\nTheir descent in emptiness all of orchid-gold.\n\nJade chewing extends the kalpa’s dawn,\nJade nectar disperses through the Centered Heart.\nLuminous pearls sing sacred songs,\nDharma’s presence harmonizes with the clear zither.\n\nJade stanzas reveal the Dao’s ultimate lineage,\nSorrow and joy dissolve the heart’s cares.\nI release myself from boundless ages,\nHow deep is this true delight!\n\nThe spontaneous melody of the lofty immortals,\nHow could it be shared in this reverence?\nAt dawn, I sport in the Eastern Flower Palace,\nAt dusk, I wander the Western Flower Hall.\n\nTaking joy in the Two Flower Halls,\nYet not encountering true joy.\nOnly hearing the Mysterious Song’s disciples,\nTheir mournful voices grieving the Heavenly Youths.\n\nSorrowful echoes flow through the Cold Court,\nStriking the heart with the world’s exhausted cycles.\nThe Heavenly Horse leaps through the Nine Rivers,\nThe Raven Mother rides the Flying Dragon.\n\nThe Mysterious Ford has no bridge,\nThe Two Qi stand sundered, unlinked.\nI ascend my towering Lingceng Terrace,\nGazing upward through the Nine Perils.\n\nFoul qi fills the Three Luminaries,\nMyriad multitudes bear calamity’s surge.\nThe Eight Domains are left without a soul,\nGreat and small mountains and peaks collapse.\n\nPondering this, I know not the learning,\nHearing the scriptures as if deaf and dumb.\nTogether we drift with fate’s course,\nSwiftly and suddenly life meets its end.\n\nAlas, how cruel the appointed time!\nThinking of you, my breast is stricken with grief.\nThe Purple Phoenix takes flight through the void,\nSoaring over the ninefold peaks of the Mysterious Gully.\n\nWhen qi congeals, the radiant form appears;\nWhen qi scatters, the spirit is no more.\nDrifting, drifting beyond all bounds,\nThe music of heaven delights my joy.\n\nI join the Eight Assemblies’ chant,\nRanking with the lofty immortals’ company.\nHand in hand with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,\nI feast my body of the Nine Phoenixes.\n\nAbove, I ascend the Jade Capital’s gates,\nBelow, I sport on the Langfeng Isle.\nFeathered steeds swiftly bear jade chariots,\nPurple mists waft through empty space.\n\nThe utmost dawn awaits the coming day,\nTogether we rejoice without end or sorrow.\nMy gaze flows with fate’s shifts,\nA hundred million kalpas begin one cycle.\n\nI delight in the natural grasp,\nDispelling the cares of the world’s woes.\nWithout the Mysterious Numinous Treasure,\nWho could share in this journey?\n\nAlas, within the hollow vastness,\nJoy arises, then sorrow returns.\nAt dawn I depart from Dongmeng Ridge,\nAt dusk I gaze upon Xilong Mound.\n\nI see not the Mother of the Nine Luminaries,\nNor the Northern Perfected wandering the Dao.\nVast the inquiry into the Great Image’s span,\nThe Two Qi suddenly encompass all.\n\nNine Dragons turn the Eastern Well,\nThe Heavenly Horse emerges from the Western Gully.\nThe Northern Emperor dispatches the heavenly hosts,\nThe Five Peaks align with the Mysterious.\n\nTen thousand demons have girded their sashes,\nThe Five Phases have long conspired.\nWar’s disasters spread across the heavens,\nMyriad multitudes are already bound.\n\nAbove and below all receive the summons,\nSwept clean without delay.\nAlas, within these Five Perils,\nFate arrives without regard for kin or stranger.\n\nI ascend the Eight Assemblies’ Palace,\nJoining my company in the unseen.\nSurveying those who pursue the ultimate learning,\nTheir blessed lands lend support.\n\nAbandoning home to seek my Dao,\nYou may attain deliverance for your body.\nDiligently cultivate the supreme scriptures,\nWhen the Dao is perfected, we shall await one another.\n\nCarefree, I observe the Phoenix Terrace,\nIs this not a joyous journey?\nIn the great assembly of the Middle Prime,\nThe Middle Prime gathers in the Garden of Joy.\n\nAbove, the qi of the Eight Assemblies,\nThe Purple Phoenix dances in birth.\nGolden branches cling to jade roots,\nSeven treasures form blossoming bells.\n\nDragons leap beyond the utmost peaks,\nPhoenixes’ cries startle ten thousand leagues.\nI see not the departed wandering guests,\nOnly hear the phoenixes’ voices in the clouds.\n\nGong and shang harmonize of themselves,\nSounds and echoes naturally arise.\nThe Mysterious Song sings wondrous melodies,\nSorrow and joy weave into music.\n\nI seek myself of my own accord,\nWho knows the Perfected Ones’ numen?\nBroidered clouds gird the night’s moon,\nPurple radiance veils flying jade.\n\nThe Three Dawns illumine the great brilliance,\nThe Seven Primes adorn the Five Stars.\nThe numinous banners bear majestic light,\nFlowing mists shroud the purple clarity.\n\nI deem the Western Flower wondrous,\nYet it does not compare to the Purple Phoenix City.\nAbove dwell those who loosen their robes,\nOne glance brings joy for ten thousand ages.\n\nTogether we rejoice without end or kalpa,\nThus awakening heaven and earth’s overturning.\nThe numinous course has its own end,\nThe reckoning’s close comes from the Mysterious of its own.\n\nComing and going follow fate’s revolutions,\nWhy entangle oneself in sorrow?\nDispel cares beyond the Eight Wastes,\nThe Great Image does not deviate from the true.\n\nCarefree in the Garden of Joy,\nWho would claim kinship with sorrow?\nThe Five Perils are constant meetings,\nThose who grieve are ever present.\n\nThough gong and shang may not harmonize,\nThe great return’s principle is naturally balanced.\nThus I offer the sorrow-joy melodies,\nTo deliver the bodies of Dao learners.\n\nThrough ascetic practice, I study the numinous texts,\nTheir wondrous meanings naturally shine.\nSimply wear the Unadorned Chapters,\nAnd you may enter the Ford of No Sorrow.\n\nRiding the void, I ascend Phoenix Terrace,\nGazing loftily upon the Tang’s reign.\nWhat joy could surpass this joy?\nWhere lies sorrow amid such joy?\n\nThe Highest Jade Dawn’s Sorrow-Joy Melodies,\nBorn in emptiness upon Phoenix Terrace,\nNuminous texts bright in the Five Directions,\nGolden tones resound clearly through the Ten Heavens.\n\nThe Ninefold-Curved Perfected Ones of Jade Capital\nAll cast gold into tablets,\nInscribed with purple brush,\nJoining voices to chant the Mysterious Song’s sorrow-joy melodies.\nTheir words are profound and recondite,\nTheir wondrous purport abysmally deep.\nNone but the Highest’s company\nCould fathom their stanzas.\n\nOnly one whose golden name is Eastern Flower,\nWhose jade title is Phoenix Gate,\nMay behold these texts.\n\nHaving received the Phoenix Qi’s Mysterious Mound Perfected Writ and the Numinous Banner Commanding Demons,\nReciting the Sorrow-Joy Melodies,\nThe Five Emperors guard the Perfected,\nHeavenly demons show reverence and protection,\nEscorting one to ascend as an immortal,\nTo attend the Sacred Lord in the Upper Clarity Palace,\nAnd wander the halls of Phoenix Terrace.\n\nThose who receive these texts\nShould, on their own fate-day, the Grand Year-star, the Eight Nodal Days,\nAnd on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month,\nBathe, purify, and fast before entering the chamber.\nFirst face east and recite the Green Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;\nTurn south and recite the Red Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;\nTurn west and recite the White Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;\nTurn north and recite the Black Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;\nFace the Grand Year-star and recite the Yellow Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected.\nAfter completing the Five Directions, return to face north and bow nine times to the Jade Dawn Lord,\nThen look up and swallow qi nine times to finish.\nThus array the Five Emperors’ banners in the chamber’s five directions.\n\nFrom *The Upper Clarity High Sage Jade Dawn Phoenix Terrace Unadorned Song Scripture*.\n\n**Cavern-Real Turning Mystery Chapter**\nThe Most High unfolds the Mysterious Store,\nResplendent, the scriptures of the Perfected number.\nScattered, scattered, they fill the heavens’ reality,\nRevered by the Ten Directions.\n\nWithout beginning, without end,\nWithout brightness, without darkness.\nI ascend the Jade Capital’s terrace,\nCarefree, I rest upon Kunlun.\n\nTranscending the Yellow Springs’ winding capital,\nThe Demon Kings long to hear.\nSeven ancestors receive transformation and birth,\nReleasing my karmic grievances of past lives.\n\nEntering, I rein in the flying Mysterious Radiance,\nExiting, I drive the floating purple clouds.\nDouble brilliance illumines the Jade Dawn,\nMysterious radiance opens the perfect clarity.\n\nFar, far the Cavern-Real Palace,\nGleaming, gleaming the seven treasures’ essence.\nOne thought delivers from the Eight Perils,\nEver joining the Most High.\n\nSpiraling, I offer the yellow radiance,\nThe sun’s flower blooms in the void’s midst.\nThe world knows the mixed and vulgar Dao,\nNone hear the Wisdom Sutra.\n\nGreat is the rebuke of the Perfected Precepts,\nThe Mysterious moves the Demon Kings to sincerity.\nTen thousand kalpas are but a single breath,\nHow could they span a thousand billion ages?\n\nThe Most High’s body is fundamentally nonbeing,\nDispersing form to deliver the weak and lost.\n\nMasters of the Dao proclaim its arcane arts,\nThe Heavenly Worthy joins in praise and exaltation.\nThose with karmic affinity manifest its scriptures,\nThose without cause conceal them in the sutras.\nShould one attain this Way,\nA radiant halo crowns the head at once.\nThe body leaps beyond all ferry-crossings,\nAssuming office in the Hall of Leisurely Transcendents.\n\nNonbeing in nonbeing ever abides in permanence,\nBeing in being rests securely in the wondrous.\nCelestial brushes inscribe the supreme,\nThe Mysterious Tradition holds its essentials.\nRevolving the Wheel of the Three Treasures,\nIts brilliance shakes the ten directions.\nThe Most High gazes upon the Jade Capital,\nThe Demon Kings laugh in empty space.\nThe Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and chants,\nThe host of Perfected ride the void in whistling song.\nScattering blossoms in my very thought,\nThe Eight Vows transcend themselves.\n\nDivine Transcendents ride the auspicious clouds,\nMounting dragons to tread the Mysterious Waves.\nHarmonizing with the Real to display felicitous omens,\nWashing their feet where men and gods converge.\nFortune’s response does not await my summons—\nThus the heavenly nets are cast wide.\nVirtue crowns the Three Realms,\nEven the Earth’s Net has been surpassed.\nInspired encounters gather the cloudlike Perfected,\nThe Lotus Sutra of Pure Wisdom blooms.\nThe supreme awakening of the four assemblies\nStretches beyond the Nine Ultimates.\nDark and bright surely have their reasons,\nYet where there is no darkness, there is no obscurity.\nSwiftly the Wheel of the Mysterious returns,\nTranscendent Realized Ones rejoice in the verdant flourishing.\n\nWandering in the boundless expanse,\nDevas and humans see no boundary.\nSubtle wonders rely on proclamation,\nDevas and humans find their ford and shore.\nSailing the fathomless abyss,\nEver fearing the winds and waves may shift.\nYet the karmic affinity holds a marvelous method—\nWho could calculate its wisdom and power?\nGently yielding to the Mysterious Azure,\nLuminously the hidden causes are judged.\nThe stalwart stalks of the Perfected’s disciples,\nPluck the zither of emptiness in midair.\nReverent thoughts attend the ten directions,\nThe Mysterious abides—no envy touches me.\n\nThe Most High unfolds the Cavern Scriptures,\nThe worthy and wise return to their root affinity.\nDesolate stands the garden of the Three Treasures,\nYet luxuriant flourish the fruits of my karma.\nThe Annalists and the Essence-Enterers,\nWith pristine substance give birth to golden bodies.\nFrom kalpa’s end to kalpa’s beginning,\nEver more radiant grows the countenance of the numinous.\nRare deliverance bows to the Supreme,\nThe Treasure Scriptures descend to the Perfected.\nThe Dao’s groves embellish the Heavenly Capital,\nTheir light below illumines the earthly Transcendents.\nUnhurried, they scatter their numinous majesty,\nVastly the Great Dharma is proclaimed.\nThe Most High surveys the ten directions,\nHushed and harmonious, the winds blend.\nThe halo of perfection mirrors the Three Luminaries,\nThe Perfected don the celestial robes.\nThe Demon Kings stand with clasped hands,\nThe Market Officers beside Fengdu’s capital.\nSun and moon veil their coursing radiance,\nThe seven treasures gleam without end.\nAll striving ceases in this hour,\nDisasters vanish, hells fall silent.\nIn the boundless Heaven of No Shadow,\nEven the honored cannot fathom.\nThe Three Treasures flourish through the ten directions,\nVast and clear in the empty midst.\nWinding with the principles of transformation,\nA single inspiration ascends the Dharma’s stream.\n\nVague and dim in the twilight,\nThe Four Great Elements arise with the times.\nEmptiness and being—nothing is not possessed,\nTowering like mountains and cliffs.\nThe Most High holds no lingering thought,\nQuelling thoughts to return to the Great Vehicle.\n\nFor the ten directions, perform the Revolving Mysterious Rites of Praise:\nBegin with the North, then Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below.\nOne hymn, one bow.\n\nThe *Revolving Mysterious* chapter emerges of itself, naturally thus.\nIt stood empty for nine thousand kalpas,\nUntil its scripture appeared.\nThe Primordial Heavenly King studied the Dao under the Most High,\nAnd after attaining the Way, the Most High commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to compile and compose it,\nTo pair with the Great Precepts.\nOn one’s natal day, recite the Three Hundred Precepts,\nAnd chant this scripture.\nPractice at noon or midnight,\nFirst purifying oneself, then performing the Dao.\nIf the natal day is unknown, use the day of Jiazi.\nAfter ten years, one may perform the Dao on the first day of the first month.\n\n**Twelve Gold Chapters**\n\nHushed, we admonish the Palace of Great Radiance,\nWhere golden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.\nThe Transcendents’ chambers reflect the Primal Simplicity,\nFour windows all of crimson jade.\nTossing the wheel across the Cavern Ford,\nReining the reins to dance the green chariot.\nJade blossoms fly like cloud-canopies,\nThe Western Consorts unfurl brocade banners.\nBeyond the dust and filth,\nSwiftly we enter the courtyard of the radiant ones.\nLong-awaited karmic responses arrive in due time,\nWhat is attained already dwells in the unseen.\nRiding the winds toward the nine skies,\nTogether we feast on the cinnabar blossoms’ infants.\nTurning to bid farewell to the world’s things,\nHow could we know the numinous in nonbeing?\n\nNorthward we ascend the Gate of Mysterious Darkness,\nHand in hand traversing the Lofty Web.\nFragrant smoke scatters the Eight Effulgences,\nThe Mysterious Wind stirs the crimson waves.\nGazing upward past the Luminous Ford,\nLooking down upon the winding mountain vales.\nWhistling songs resound above the clouds,\nPhoenixes sing through the ninefold radiance.\nRiding qi to float in the great void,\nWhy tread the mountain slopes?\nWith golden tablets we summon the feathered spirits,\nLeading the troops to crush the myriad demons.\nRinsing and imbibing the halo of the Perfect Dawn,\nAccumulating kalpas like sprouting buds.\nIn the clamor of rushing and striving,\nWho understands what can be done?\n\nThe northern mound gathers cloudlike radiance,\nCrimson trees bear purple blossoms.\nAzure buds fall in the Phoenix Grove,\nJade stamens adorn the crags’ recesses.\nThe numinous towers soar into the great void,\nJasper chambers mingle with the Great Radiance.\nClouds rise within the winding chambers,\nThe Eight Winds scatter the dark sands.\nThe Ninefold Mist strums the Emperor’s Pond,\nDragons chant in harmonious measure.\nFanning the storm over the Five Peaks,\nWielding the tablets to subdue the myriad demons.\nGlancing back in a moment’s span,\nSuddenly kalpas have passed.\nAlas for those born at dawn—\nHow could they know the span of ages?\n\nThe cornered radiance spreads through the Forest Palace,\nThe axle turns through the silent and obscure.\nThe supreme vision illumines the Six Courts,\nGreat and small all attain carefree ease.\nDragon pipes coil through the canopy clouds,\nTiger roars startle the myriad branches.\nThe Three Primes unfold the lofty chart,\nCinnabar clouds embellish the morning skies.\nFeathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,\nPurple chariots soar with blossoming plumes.\nReining the reins beyond the Nine Heavens,\nLooking up and down in boundless solitude.\nDust and condemnation weave defilement,\nSpirits perish, qi withers away.\nWhy not seek the distant chariot?\nEight thousand years are but a single morning.\n\nMorning crosses the azure sea’s waves,\nThe flying wheel departs the green chambers.\nSinging high the *Ode to Companions*,\nWe soar beyond the azure vastness.\nThree pacts with the jade-sky guests,\nFive covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.\nThe feathered storm ascends the Emperor’s Dawn,\nFeasting in this Palace of Vast Cold.\nThe Eight Sounds pluck the void,\nPurple phoenixes sing the numinous wind.\nCrimson clouds veil the bright radiance,\nThe Eight Effulgences fly through the great void.\nSavoring the jasper springs’ ford,\nVast and elegant, returning to infancy’s simplicity.\nSupreme joy unites the Five Spirits,\nAges accumulate like blades of grass.\nShedding the sandals—what difficulty?\nYet toil and sorrow lose the heavens’ midst.\n\nMorning’s chariot rides the dawn’s radiance,\nLeisurely reins set forth from the Purple Clarity.\nThe floating wheel gallops through the Great Radiance,\nRaising the canopy over the Vast Cold’s courtyard.\n\nWithin the halls of the Highest Perfected, the imperial chambers are forbidden,\nPalace walls summon the Four Numinous Ones.\nTen Perfections dance through the hollow void,\nWafting mist coils round brocade screens.\nTiger-fans stir the divine wind’s blessing,\nPurple clouds wheel with paired dragons.\nSwift as a glance to the eight directions,\nA single look topples the camphor-tree of ages.\n\nO reclusive youths of the Mysterious Contest,\nWhy not seek the Great Life?\nThe divine gardens bloom with hidden mushrooms,\nThe Kun Pool irrigates the fields of vision.\nGazing upward to the Jade Clarity’s gates,\nTowering above the crimson ford.\nPurple auroras illumine the winding seats,\nFive clouds radiate the Nine Profounds.\nEight winds rise from the farthest reaches,\nMystic vapors linger ‘twixt emerald pavilions.\n\nThe Three Primes lodge in the Western Palace,\nIn Eastern Florescence dwells a fair one.\nThe Northern Darkness chants the Seven Whistles,\nBright Consort sings the Southern Perfected.\nStriking the zhu-lute in harmony with the Vermilion Pitch,\nJade batons raise the six strings.\nConjoined in pact beyond fate’s course,\nTogether they resound on the phoenix’s peak.\nIn unison they summon the myriad demons,\nDwelling here with the black multitudes.\nHow difficult to transcend and come?\nYet thus they unlock boundless years.\n\nRiding qi through the hollow void,\nMounting the light to rest in the Nine Heavens.\nLush and dense, the vast radiance’s plumes,\nThe dark canopy arises in the spaceless.\nEight mists swirl round the boundless wheel,\nIts track lingering, defying time.\nStriking the zhu-lute, the eight voids resound,\nMy steed too finds no ford.\nGrasping the baton, I enter Eastern Florescence,\nEvening feasts atop the Mystic Garden’s peak.\nGirding my sash, I bear the Five Spirits,\nLoosening my collar, I long for my beloved.\nDark resonance follows its own course,\nBuoyantly, it too has its karmic ties.\nTogether we soar on swift pinions,\nA single flap stirs billions.\n\nCrimson light floats in the dark dawn,\nPurple chariots ride the cloud-borne journey.\nLooking up, I transcend the Golden Gates,\nGazing down, I behold the Western Florescence.\nEastern Florescence unfolds its fivefold radiance,\nDivine light illumines the Seven Spirits.\nVeiled reflections of the Three Floating Candles,\nFlowing freely, they equal the dark and the bright.\nWinds drum through the hollow void’s halls,\nIncense smoke scatters in the jade courtyard.\nHand in hand with the Weaving Maid’s dance,\nTwin sashes fall in brocade’s azure.\nPrimal circling of feathered banners,\nFloral canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.\nFeasting and resting beyond the ninefold bounds,\nRight and wrong no longer concern me.\nEmbracing emptiness within the Mud-Pill,\nMy celestial form daily renews its infancy.\nHow much more the void’s defilements,\nWithin which bleakness breeds aimless life.\n\nFusang’s peaks rise in emerald emptiness,\nVermilion clouds bloom in faint light.\nThe Wave Terrace has its heights of void,\nFour vistas mirror the lofty clarity.\nFlying light reins the purple wheel,\nThree Primes guide the cinnabar carriage.\nReclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,\nTowering in the Celestial Mother’s courts.\nWashing my feet in the azure rapids,\nRaising the jade flagon of sweet wine.\nAt dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,\nLightly, lightly, descending in time.\nBriefly alighting amid earth’s mists,\nTurning my chariot toward the Good Perfected.\nMystic gatherings convene of themselves,\nWandering freely through the dark and the hidden.\nOnly now do I know the bitterness of honor and disgrace,\nOnly now do I awaken to sorrow’s hastening of years.\n\nThe secluded chamber may be pure and still,\nNurturing the spirit, awaiting the sun’s fulfillment.\nWhy pursue the paths of the world,\nWhere a hundred ailments arise therefrom?\nThe Heavenly Court births golden blossoms,\nWithin, they manifest yin’s perversities.\nThe Jade Valley joins the Mysterious Realm,\nJasper qi mutually sustains its web.\nCelestial Perfected stand in distant days,\nFlying medicines spew forth numinous sands.\nAt dawn’s clarity, I harness the heavenly steed,\nTurning my chariot toward the Divine Mystery’s home.\nImmortal ones come to enter the chamber,\nAgain to extinguish the hundred perversities.\n\nThe Dao takes purification as foremost,\nDiligent practice ascends the Golden Gates.\nThus is built the Great Dharma Bridge,\nUniversally ferrying all beings.\nRepaying the kindness of past lives,\nThe Dao-heart arises transcendent.\nSix fasts honor the hollow void,\nTen vigils move the gods to clarity.\nThe Five Elders inscribe the immortals’ names,\nCloud chariots welcome and receive.\nThe body soars to ascend the Mystic Capital,\nSeven generations all attain liberation.\n\nThe hymns of the Highest Clarity’s Perfected Ones conclude.",

One scroll. *Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, \"Hymns and Eulogies\" section of the *Dongxuan* Department.\n\n---\n\n### **Hymns of the Supreme Clarity Perfected Ones**\n\n#### **Hymn of the Three Contracts of the Supreme Clarity Pace-Void**\nFrom the beginning, the Cavern-Void is empty,\nThe Three Blacks ascend to the gate of essence.\nPurple wings gleam in the Great Void,\nThe Four Illuminations plant the root of spirit.\nWondrous transformation blooms in the Eastern Jade,\nThe Three Conveniences open the Western Kun.\nRadiant and bright, the Nine Mysteries’ essence,\nFive Florets girded with brocade clouds.\nDeparting the net, the divine lamp shines,\nThe Seven Stars illuminate the Northern Origin.\nFloating, floating, ascending to the Dharma precincts,\nWing to wing, the Imperial Unity is revered.\nLofty, lofty, the exalted hymn,\nHow the feathered youths swarm!\nFlowing fragrance is without color,\nYet it enters the myriad immortals’ throng.\nLeftward, the Three Kalpas revolve,\nRightward, the Ten Thousand Arrows’ pass turns.\nCloud florets tassel the Five Clouds,\nEight Phoenixes dance in the wheel of space.\nThe Four Seasons never halt their mechanism,\nBlue and white are early distinguished.\nNine nines alter the kalpa’s fate,\nThree threes traverse one cycle.\nHeaven and Earth have their final meeting,\nAdversity and stimulus return to the banner.\nThe Cavern Illumination’s Orthodox Unity Dharma,\nSolemnly concludes the Six Heavens’ patterns.\nGreat Peace reverts to emptiness and nothingness,\nServing and aiding the Later Sage Lord.\n\nThe divine wind rises at the Western Gate,\nBrocade clouds arise from the Eastern Jade.\nThe Two Qi gleam upon the Jade Isle,\nFlowing fragrance rides the mist, light.\nFive Florets unfurl in the wind,\nIn an instant, the Nine Clarities shine bright.\nThe Kun Forest glows with the Vermilion Sun,\nYellow Florets follow the moon’s birth.\nWithin, the herb-gathering youths,\nClothed in feathers, girded with flying azure.\nThe scenery of ten thousand peaks,\nCarefree, feasting in the green chariot.\nMastering the Nine Void Transmissions,\nTheir motion unfolds without fixed measure.\nLeft, they command the Three Heavens’ patterns,\nRight, they seize the Six Heavens’ hosts.\nThey inspect qi and the Cavern-Void,\nThe celestial degrees align with fate’s tilt.\nKalpas have their own meetings,\nWho laments defeat or success?\nVast waves engulf the cloud’s net,\nThe Six Harmonies leave no trace.\nWhite corpses drift on the long flow,\nLonely souls scatter and fade.\nGrieving this departure and return,\nOnly then is the Orthodox Dharma’s clarity known.\nDevoted study and refined cultivation,\nIn the Eastern Flower, a jade name is forged.\nRejoicing in those of the White Tablet,\nTogether they delight in Great Peace.\n\nThe Cavern Gates turn the celestial net,\nThe Kingly Qi revolves the Three Subtleties.\nPurple portals spew jade tablets,\nGolden gates receive the divine radiance.\nThe Eight Assemblies exchange the true wind,\nBrilliant and bright, the layered darkness opens.\nBeyond the Nine Clarities at heaven’s edge,\nLofty, lofty, the exalted dawn returns.\nThree hues revert to emptiness and nothingness,\nThe Four Seasons respond to the Jade Precincts.\nThe River waits, brush already poised,\nThe Five Phases subtly propel one another.\nThe Six Perfections know no end,\nWhen fate exhausts, they ride qi to return.\nTen thousand demons spread across the heavens,\nHordes of fiends vie to display their might.\nThe multitudes bear calamity’s thrust,\nPiles of corpses move one to sorrow.\nWondrous, the Orthodox Dharma’s patterns,\nTreading kalpas, their brightness never fades.\nAt the destined time, they are welcomed,\nTheir pact at the Nine Heavens’ gates.\nWith you, I await Great Peace,\nReleasing the body to fly wingless.\n\n---\n\n#### **Hymn of the Supreme Clarity Rotating Walk**\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious subtleties,\nThe lofty void encompasses the Three Wheels.\nGolden Immortals open the numinous gates,\nGleaming as if the Nine Heavens divide.\nGreat Florets scatter in the purple void,\nEight Perfected reflect the plain clouds.\nThe Mysterious Mother binds the supreme vow,\nThe Eight Gates of the walking tablet.\nTen thousand blessings converge in the numinous assembly,\nRaising incense, they chant the Lower Origin.\nWondrous recitation moves the Void’s depths,\nAchieving union with the exalted immortals’ throng.\nRotating, they walk and bow to the Cavern-Void,\nKowtowing to the Imperial Lord.\n\n---\n\n#### **Pace-Void Lament and Joy Wisdom Verses**\nI bind my natural qi,\nCongealing and transforming the Purple Phoenix City.\nThe high terrace soars beyond the Nine Ridges,\nTowering and layered, forming flying jade.\nGleaming and falling upon the layered void,\nWinding through the Eight Clarities’ caverns.\nPurple canopies illuminate the cloud palaces,\nFlowing radiance shades the Five Numinous.\nFour directions reach boundless wilds,\nEight qi revolve in round clarity.\nThe whirlwind turns the Great Void,\nThe Seven Luminaries revolve the celestial scriptures.\nTheir motion comes as if without form,\nTheir departure follows transformation’s tilt.\nWithin the Nine Circles’ crossings,\nThe Two Images mutually contend.\nThe Imperial Unity solidifies the Central Origin,\nThe Four Nets do not decline in spirit.\nSouthward, they gather the Flying Sovereign’s treasure,\nNorthward, they array the Broad Cold Court.\nMysterious chambers exchange true meetings,\nVoid songs arise naturally.\nThe Five Thearchs command the numinous banners,\nDemon flags subdue the myriad essences.\nDemons howl from the void’s midst,\nThe Dao-world’s joy knows no end.\nThus, the pure verses arise,\nCelebrating the spirits, delighting in Great Peace.\nWith whom do we pact, and where?\nTen thousand kalpas as one age.\nRevolving ninety thousand kalpas,\nTogether we roam the Purple Phoenix chariot.\n\nThe Void births the Purple Phoenix Terrace,\nJade towers join the Supreme Subtlety.\nThe numinous wind pervades the Eight Assemblies,\nThe Northern Window and Heavenly Gates open.\nAbove, the whistling and singing youths,\nEver chant the turning of decay and decline.\nAt dawn, they ride the luminaries to wander,\nAt dusk, they return with the luminaries.\nThe Two Luminaries unite as one body,\nEver fearing to lose the radiance’s gleam.\nThe Nine Qi do not abide forever,\nHeaven and Earth have their overturning peril.\nThe great kalpa concludes one cycle,\nA hundred and six ride fate’s return.\nVast springs surge from the Nine Ridges,\nThe Great Crow soars at heaven’s verge.\nTen thousand creatures drift on the long flow,\nGazing at the mountains, they find no refuge.\nWailing without bound,\nHow can one not grieve in the heart?\nThe worthy and sagely diligently recite scriptures,\nThus they ride the luminaries to fly.\nAt the destined time, they are welcomed,\nTogether they meet at the Nine Heavens’ gates.\n\nWhen the golden horse’s time is exhausted,\nTen thousand calamities surge and clash.\nNo immortal learners are seen,\nOnly those who weep for the corpses in sorrow.\nAlas, these foolish beings,\nClinging to life, how piteous their lament!\nDispersing sorrow at the Nine Mysteries’ terrace,\nGathering joy in the Great Void.\nHolding pact with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,\nWhistling to summon the Eastern Sea youths.\nFour directions, the Eight Assemblies’ qi,\nThe mysterious motion of the Lang Terrace’s wind.\nThe sun shines on the Western Flower Hall,\nThe mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Void.\nDancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,\nDesolate, the Nine Ridges’ peaks.\nGazing across boundless wilds,\nLooking up to the kalpa’s measure.\nClear songs harmonize with palace and commerce,\nSorrow and joy naturally follow.\nThe Two Paths harmonize in one pact,\nPrinciple’s back turns, yet returns to unity.\nTogether, joy knows no end,\nHolding the beginning, again holding the end.\nDrinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s nectar,\nLooking up to drink from the Flying Flower Sovereign.\nThe numinous melon is fit for feasting,\nIts flavor like the sun and moon’s light.",

      "original_text": "高真禁帝室，宫墉引四灵。 十绝舞空洞，飞烟绕锦屏。 虎扇神风庆，紫云回龙骈。 鲦欻盻八方，一顾椿已倾。 萧萧玄竞子，奚不寻太生。 神圃秀隐芝，昆池灌盻田。 仰观玉清阙，嵯峨临绛津。 紫霞映曲席，五云曜九玄。 八风起绝宇，幽蔼绿轩间。 三元舍西宫，东华有佳人。 北冥唱七啸，明姬歌南真。 抚璈参朱律，玉节扬六弦。 合契安非运，俱响广凤巅。 同期命万魔，宅此群黑千。 超然来何难，乃启不穷年。 驾炁盻空洞，乘景憩九天。 洞郁广晖羽，玄盖生无间。 八烟飙寥轮，轨滞不许年。 抚璈八空响，我马亦无津。 握节入东华，夕宴玄圃巅。 束带携五灵，解衿翘良人。 冥感自适运，泛然亦有缘。 俱载凌厉翮，一扇动亿千。 绛景浮玄晨，紫轩乘云征。 仰超金阙内，俯盻西华城。 东华启五晖，神光焕七灵。 翳映三泛烛，流任自齐冥。 风鼓空洞宇，香烟散玉庭。 手携织女舞，双衿落锦青。 元徊交羽旗，华盖随云倾。 宴寝九度外，是非不我营。 抱空泥丸内，天姿愈日婴。 岂况洞愆秽，中惨无聊生。 扶桑翠空峰，朱云葩微明。 浪台有虚上，四观映高清。 飞景控紫轮，三素辔丹軿。 寝偃太帝馆，崚嶒阿母庭。 濯足碧濑波，提契玉醴罂。 曲晨乘风扇，飘飘时下倾。 暂适地蔼中，回驾汜良真。 玄会自相要，流浪任幽冥。 始知荣辱辛，方悟忧促龄。 曲室可清静，颐神待日成。 何为讲当涂，百痾从是生。 天庭生金华，内以彰阴邪。 玉谷参玄乡，琼炁互扶罗。 天真立遐日，飞药吐灵沙。 清晨案天马，回驾神玄家。 仙人来入室，又以灭百邪。 道以斋为先，勤行登金阙。 故设大法桥，普度诸人物。 宿世恩德报，道心超然发。 六斋礼空洞，十直神感彻。 五老刊仙名，云舆相迎谒。 身飞升玄都，七祖咸解脱。 上清诸真章颂竟 #1『有』字据《曲素经》补。 #2『不』字原本作『求』，据《太上洞真徊旋章》改。",
