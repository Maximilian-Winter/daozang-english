  "full_translation": "**Stele Record of the Immortal Sages of the Scripture Terrace of Mount Zhongnan**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Brick Record of the Immortal Sages of the Scripture Terrace of Mount Zhongnan*\nCompiled by Zhu Xiangxian of the Yuan Dynasty. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jizhuan* Category.\n\nThe Most High Perfected of the Nine Heavens and Celestial Earl, Master Wenshi, the Supreme Perfected—\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Inner Transmission*, the Perfected One bore the surname Yin, given name Xi, and courtesy name Gongwen, a native of Tianshui. His mother, née Lu, dreamed of celestial lightning coiling around her body before the Perfected One was born. At his birth, twin beams of light like suns danced beside him. His eyes held the essence of the sun, and his form was tall and refined. From youth, he delighted in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the *Searches*, the *Plain Questions*, and the *Book of Changes*, excelling in celestial portents and esoteric weft-texts. Gazing above and below, nothing escaped his penetrating insight; even the transformations of ghosts and spirits could not conceal their truths from him. Of magnanimous and heroic bearing, he concealed his virtue and practiced benevolence.\n\nLater, he wandered through mountains and rivers, and in the village of Wenxian in Gaizu County, within the divine precincts of Yongzhou’s Mount Zhongnan, he built a thatched hut, refining his spirit in pursuit of the supreme Dao. Though he sought no fame, his reclusive renown spread far. King Kang of Zhou, hearing of him, appointed him Grand Master, later summoning him to serve as a guest-friend in the Eastern Palace. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao’s reign (the *guichou* year), he beheld a purple qi advancing westward from the east and knew a sage would pass through the capital. Thus, he requested appointment as Magistrate of Hangu Pass to await him.\n\nWhen the appointed time came, he purified himself, observed the precepts of the Perfected, instructed the gatekeepers, swept the roads, and burned incense to await the arrival of the Celestial Perfected. On the *jiazi* day of the seventh month that year, the Old Master arrived at the pass. The Perfected One donned his court robes to welcome him, prepared a seat in his lodging, and served him facing north. Thereupon, he resigned on grounds of illness and retired from office. In the twelfth month of that year, he invited the Old Master to his estate on Mount Zhongnan, where he fasted, sought the Dao, and entreated him to compose a scripture for the enlightenment of later generations. The Old Master then expounded the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue* and transmitted to him the Way of Inner Cultivation of the Three Ones, along with the secret of the *Western Ascension*.\n\nAfter the transmission of the Dao was complete, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month of the following year (*jiayin*), the Old Master prepared to take leave and ascend to heaven. The Perfected One, grief-stricken, begged him to stay. The Old Master admonished him, saying: \"You must purify yourself for a thousand days, study and recite these two scrolls, refine your form to enter the subtle, and only then may you seek me at the market of the Green Ram in Shu Commandery.\" The Perfected One assented and bowed in gratitude.\n\nWith these words, upon a small hill south of his dwelling, the Old Master mounted the clouds, rode the radiance, and ascended into the Great Subtlety.\n\nThe Perfected One then retired to a thatched hut to purify himself in solitude, cutting off all worldly affairs. Within three years, his mind congealed and his form dissolved, his body entering a state of natural spontaneity. He mastered the subtleties of calculation and transformation, the principles of unifying form and multiplying spirit—all attaining their utmost wonder. Thereupon, he composed nine scrolls, entitled *Master Guan of the Pass*. He then journeyed to the market of the Green Ram in Shu Commandery to meet the Old Master. The Old Master bestowed upon him the title *Master of the Literary Beginning* and appointed him as the Supreme Perfected One, commanding all celestial immortals and transcendents.\n\nThe present Green Ram Palace in Chengdu Prefecture stands upon its former site. According to the *Origins of the Louguan Tradition*, Louguan was originally the residence of Lord Guan, a minister of King Kang of Zhou. He wove thatch into a tower to observe the stars and contemplate the *qi*, hence its name, Louguan. This marked the beginning of such temples and monasteries. Here, the transmission of the Dao and the bestowal of scriptures gave rise to the great teaching. Thus, the ancient sages and later worthies, venerating the lofty Perfected Ones, revered the Dao and virtue as the source of life and transformation, and honored immortality as the foundation of their teachings. They sought the traces of the myriad wonders and aspired to the ultimate return of the profound mystery.\n\nKing Mu of Zhou, during his western tour, and the First Emperor of Qin, during his eastern hunt, both turned their chariots from their paths to personally pay homage to the true lineage. The First Emperor built a temple south of the tower, Emperor Wu of Han erected a palace north of the observatory, and the Jin and Song dynasties offered inscribed tablets—some of which remain to this day. From the Qin and Han onward, temple households continued without interruption, for all dynasties revered this blessed site. Those who ascended to transcendence and attained the Dao have never been lacking. What is recorded here merely recounts old traditions; the deeds of those near and far cannot all be exhaustively investigated. The transmitted records are lengthy, so only the essentials are excerpted.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOf old, the Perfected One,\nDwelt in a tower, nurturing tranquility.\nA green ox drew his carriage,\nA purple aura heralded his gaze.\nReceiving the scriptures, he grasped their essence,\nUnveiling the Dao’s hidden depths.\nA single wave of the mysterious tide\nSpread its gradual flow across the four seas.\nNorth of Mount Zhongnan,\nHis abode left behind a grand legacy.\nThe teaching, revered through the ages,\nIts branches flourished through generations.\nInheriting the sages’ wisdom,\nPlumbing the profound’s profundity.\nGreat are the nine scrolls,\nIlluminating our posterity.\n\n**Du Yang Palace’s Supreme Harmony Lord Yin, the Perfected One**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Gui, courtesy name Gongdu, a disciple of Master of the Literary Beginning. He served his master early and received the wonders of the Dao in person. Upon attaining the Dao, the Supreme One summoned him to Supreme Harmony, where he governed the celestial bureaucracy at Du Yang Palace, reviewing the *Illustrated Records of True Immortals*, inspecting the divine offices and ghostly officials, wielding authority over the thousand spirits, and purifying the myriad ghosts. At times, he roamed the seas and mountains; at others, he ascended to pay homage in the Jade Capital. During the Yongxing era of the Jin, he descended again to this observatory, where the Daoist Liang Chen encountered him and received a cinnabar scripture before his departure.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe immortal, now risen to celestial ranks,\nHis cinnabar furnace beneath the pines, overgrown with green moss.\nWho could have foreseen, a thousand years hence,\nHe would return to his old home to bestow the scriptures again.\n\n**Mount Wangwu’s Supreme Ultimate Lord Du, the Perfected One**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Chong, a native of Haojing. At barely twenty, having heard of the Master of the Literary Beginning’s attainment of the Dao, he came to study under him. The Master was then in Shu, residing in the thatched hut of the Perfected One’s abode. King Mu, longing to follow the traces of immortals, commanded his chariot to visit, building an observatory and appointing Chong and six others as Daoists. After completing his refinement and cultivation, his body emanated jade-like radiance, his five viscera were replete, his appearance and breath harmonized, and he dissolved his fetal bonds and untied his knots, penetrating the wonders of the myriad things. In the year *jihai* of King Yi, he ascended. He was tasked with governing the immortals of Mount Wangwu.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe dark and mighty one shed the dusty world,\nTime within things—like a flick of the finger.\nReturning to the grotto-heaven to observe the myriad wonders,\nHe spurs the yellow crane aloft to the celestial altar.\n\n**The Perfected One of the Red City and Master Peng**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Zong, styled Faxian, a native of Pengcheng. When King Mu of Zhou revered the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he summoned worthy talents, and the Perfected One answered the call, becoming a disciple of the Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate. He received the Dao of the Feminine One. Thereupon, he refined his spirit to enter the wondrous, penetrating the numinous source. He could merge three days and nights into a single breath, or submerge beneath the water, emerging only after a full day. At times, he would lie exposed for months, and though people suspected him dead, he would rise again, light and vigorous. In the year *bingshen* of King Li, he ascended. He was appointed as the Immortal Earl of the Red City.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Perfected One breathed where the crowd choked,\nHis breath profound—his Dao daily renewed.\nThough all say Zhuangzi unveiled the hidden,\nWho knows his teachings had trace and cause?\n\n**The Perfected One Song of the Grand Clarity**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Lun, styled Dexuan, a native of Weiyang. From youth, he bore the true formulas, dwelling in the mysterious realm, exploring the source of blockage and passage, and attaining the Dao of the union of form and spirit. Often he traversed waves and perilous paths, never by ford or road. Thus he could gaze east upon the Sunrise Valley, reach west to the Board Wind, journey south to the Long Separation, and travel north to the Dark Mound, circling the eight poles and obscurely observing the heavens’ motion. At times he dwelt on sacred peaks, at times within the gates of heaven, or played among things—none recognized him. In the year *yisi* of King Jing, he ascended.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\n**The Grand Clarity’s Immortal Traveler Rides the Dao’s Dragon,**\nVacuity and reality merge as one to reach great penetration.\nTen thousand rivers and a thousand mountains cannot bar his way—\nFrom south to north, from west to east, he moves as he will.\n\n**Perfected One Feng of the Western Marchmount**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Chang, styled Yanshou, a native of Lishan. Well-versed in the *Great Ease*, he was summoned by King Xuan to serve as Archivist Beneath the Pillars. At forty, he resigned his post and entered the Dao, where he encountered Immortal Lord Deng and received the profound mysteries of the *Yellow Court*. He then entered Mount Zhongnan, hewed a chamber from the cliffs to dwell in, cultivated stillness to contemplate the Dao, and nurtured tranquility within. Once his inner treasure was full, he could extend his power to all things—healing the people’s afflictions, quelling raging flames, and correcting wild maladies—all manifesting at the mere movement of his intent, without deliberate effort. In the year *gengyin* of King Ping, he ascended.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHe cast aside his post as Archivist Beneath the Pillars of King Xuan,\nThen, staff in hand, entered Zhongnan’s depths.\nThe *Yellow Court* recited in solitude—none saw him—\nOne pillow of pure wind, and he slept soundly.\n\n**Perfected One Yao of the White Water Palace**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Tan, styled Yuantai, a native of Fenshui. His mind was fixed on the Supreme Mystery; serene and lofty, he stood apart. When Duke Xiang returned to Qi, he bowed northward and called him master. Feasting on wind and savoring the Dao, he was revered by scholar-officials, who held him in awe as if he were a divine being. Petitions and visits came daily, yet he withdrew into the distance. Once, walking in the rain, his sleeves remained dry. His eyes held a divine radiance, flashing like lightning; he always walked with them closed, fearing he might startle living things. When asked to open them slightly, his gaze would instantly emit a swift, luminous glow. In the year *renxu* of King Jian, he ascended. He was in charge of the White Water Palace.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nAmidst cliffs and gorges, his bearing was ancient and free—\nUnfettered in rustic robes, he humbled the lord of his age.\nHis lofty heart dreamed no red-dust dreams,\nWith a flick of his sleeve, he left the white clouds beyond the hidden crags.\n\n**Perfected Zhou of Qin-Long Palace**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Liang, styled Taiyi, a native of Taiqiu. He received the Dao from Perfected Yao the Immortal and was called his foremost disciple. Once, he played the *se* zither and blew the *sheng* pipes with Prince Jin, eldest son of King Ling of Zhou, roaming together through Shang and Luo. With a single string, he could evoke the harmony of all eight tones—clashing bronze and chiming jade—while a hundred birds danced in unison. Or he would traverse the famed peaks, displaying divine transformations. Though still young, his hair turned white by dawn, and none could fathom him. In the year *jimao* of King Lie, he ascended in broad daylight. He was appointed Immortal Official of Qin-Long Palace.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWith Prince Jin, he pledged to wander as one,\nLaughing at the world’s vanity as they roamed the heights of Shang.\nHis immortal grace was as fair as spring—\nYet why, by morning, was his head crowned with snow?\n\n**Immortal Qingyin**\nThe Immortal’s name was Cheng, styled Chumo, a native of Fenyin. At twenty-eight, he entered the Dao. First, he secluded himself in the Southern Mountains, drawing water and hewing cypress, as if to spend his life thus. Diligent in burning incense and reciting scriptures, when the censer’s fragrance was exhausted, a numinous darkness arose of its own; when the lamp’s oil ran dry, divine radiance still gleamed in the void. Once, he cast a talisman into the river, and the waters flowed backward. The First Emperor of Qin visited his temple to pay homage, ordering a hall built facing east and attendants assigned to sweep and tend the grounds. When the Emperor summoned Cheng to discourse on the Mystery, he admonished him: *\"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\"* Their words failed to align, and he departed with a flourish—\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe river’s flow was tested when a small talisman was cast—\nsuddenly the surging torrents reversed their course.\nThe First Emperor of Qin, in vain, offered an empty seat to question,\nyet with a single upward glance, a sword had already slashed through autumn’s expanse.\n\n**Grand Presence Palace Perfected Wang**\nThe Perfected, named Tan, styled Yangbo, was a native of Taiyuan.\nDuring Empress Lü’s reign, he once held the post of Palace Attendant, but later cast off his official cap to enter the Dao.\nHe encountered Master Xiling Zidu and received the arts of concealing one’s form and transforming one’s shape, able to vanish without trace, clouds and mist shifting at will.\nWhen he met an old acquaintance who grew suspicious, he transformed into a tree, then into fire, then into water, insects, beasts, and strange objects—no fixed form remained. The acquaintance, bewildered, fled in dismay.\nMoments later, the Perfected reappeared by the roadside.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Yuanshuo era, he ascended in broad daylight.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTransforming into fire, then into a spring,\nhe turned back to see his robes and cap still dignified in their splendor.\nThe old friend, dumbfounded, could only gape in awe—\nthe divine mechanism had ever been at his fingertips.\n\n**Western Marchmount Perfected Li**\nThe Perfected, named Yi, styled Zhongfu, was a native of Yingchuan.\nFrom youth, he aspired to the Dao, his spirit serene and bearing far-reaching.\nAt the time, Emperor Wu of Han, following the temple’s design, built the Gazing-Upon-Immortals Palace and expanded the ranks of Daoist officials. The Perfected answered the selection and entered the Dao, dwelling in true stillness, nurturing his primordial qi in emptiness.\nLater, he met the Perfected Taihe, who led him to Duyang Palace to serve Immortal Lord Wang. He was then sent forth to return, drifting with the wind and drawing near the light, his comings and goings without constancy.\n\nIn the second year of the Guanghe era of Emperor Ling, he ascended in broad daylight.\nHe was appointed Perfected Lord of the Western Marchmount.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nAcross ages sealed in mustard-seed, master and disciple met—\nTogether they journeyed straight to Duyang Palace.\nThe twin luminaries departed, leaving no trace,\nWhile time and again, Xianyang’s sunset glowed crimson.\n\n**Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity, Feng**\nThe Perfected, named Heng, styled Junda, was a native of Longxi and well-versed in the learning of Laozi and Zhuangzi.\nDuring the Yongping era of Emperor Ming of Han, he answered the selection of the worthy and enlightened and was ordained as a Daoist priest.\nThe Perfected Lu bestowed upon him the supreme Dao along with the *True Form Talismans of the Five Marchmounts*.\nEver astride a blue ox, he wandered the Five Marchmounts, where malevolent spirits and monstrous ghosts fled at his approach from a thousand *li* away.\nYet his nature was deeply compassionate: he saved those who met violent deaths, drawing medicine from the bamboo slips at his waist to offer them, and they were instantly cured at his touch.\nLater, he entered the Dark Mound Mountain and was seen no more.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSleeves brimming with divine talismans, he shot at the Dipper and Ox—\nHeaven’s demons and mountain ghosts saw him and fled in dread.\nDisdaining the celestial bureaus’ profusion of offices,\nHe rode his blue ox straightaway, roaming boundless and free.\n\n**High Perfected of the Grand Clarity, Zhang**\nThe Perfected, named Hao, styled Wenming, was a native of Runan.\nDuring the Yongchu era of the Han, he was ordained and entered the Dao.\nHe paid homage to Perfected Feng, seeking to awaken what he had not yet grasped.\nPerfected Feng, foreseeing his arrival, tested him thrice—each time he surpassed expectation—and thus transmitted to him the Dao of the Void and the Black Metal Womb.\nThereafter, his eyes could see through all things, his ears could hear with perfect clarity, clouds and mist wove about his body, and the radiance of sun and moon congealed upon him.\nAt times he transformed into soaring clouds, at others into a white crane, ascending the void and concealing his light, his transformations beyond reckoning.\nIn the Taihe era of the Wei, he ascended in broad daylight.\nHe was appointed High Perfected of the Grand Clarity.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe elixir in the crucible ripens as heaven itself,\nWhite cranes and soaring clouds he fashions with a gesture.\nHis gaze pierces the Eight Cords—nothing remains unseen—\nHe rides backward on the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to the Jasper Capital.\n\nPerfected Liang Kaocheng\nPerfected One named Chen, a native of Fufeng.\nIn the early Xianxi era of the Wei, he came to study under Master Zheng.\nFor years he trod the Dao, his aspirations lofty and remote, his devotion profound and far-reaching.\nIn the second year of Yongxing of Emperor Hui of Jin, the Perfected One of Grand Harmony descended into his courtyard and transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Yellow Essence of Sun and Moon*, the method of the Elixir of Water and Stone, and the *Inner Transmission of Origins*.\nAfter three years, the elixir was complete. His body became light as a feather, his complexion like a child’s; his eyes could see through the earth, his ears could hear the heavens.\nIn the second year of Taixing of the Eastern Jin, he ascended in broad daylight.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nAcross ages meeting a master—was it mere chance?\nThe divine elixir he received from Grand Harmony’s transmission.\nThe Embryonic Immortal dances forth the Law of Audience at the Primordial,\nIn the radiance of the Supreme Ultimate, time itself is forgotten.\n\nPerfected Wang Zinian\nPerfected One named Jia, a native of Longxi.\nDuring the Jianxing era of the Jin, he was ordained.\nHis spirit shone with luminous clarity; his affairs were often foreseen.\nHe knew men and verified things—all deemed him divine.\nLater, when the north and south split asunder and rival states vied to summon him with rites, he withdrew into the mountains, yet inquiries never ceased.\nAt eighty-seven, he declared his minor obligations unfulfilled.\nYao Chang sought his counsel on state matters, but he vehemently rebuked him and was slain for it.\nThat very day, friends in Longyou saw him, and his works such as the *Record of Gleanings* circulated in the world.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nMinor obligations still hung unresolved—\nHe let the white blade sever the spring wind.\nHad Longxi not met his knowing friends,\nWho would have known the master was but an empty transformation?\n\nPerfected Sun Zhongxuan\nPerfected One named Che, of unknown origin.\nDuring the Guangchu era of the Former Zhao, he came to study under Master Wang.\nReticent in speech yet swift in action, he wore coarse cloth and drank plain water.\nHis wit remained concealed, his sole concern was to hide his brilliance.\nThe master esteemed him and treated him as a friend.\nWhen questioned, he did not answer in words but let his countenance reveal fortune or misfortune.\nHe often secluded himself in a chamber, sitting upright all day, serene in communion with the numinous.\nThose who saw him from afar felt their hearts and bearing grow solemn.\nAt seventy, he released his form.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWho with glib tongue could stir strife?\nKnock, and he neither responds nor resists.\nWith upright demeanor, he awakens beings without flaw—\nHe lets each perceive the moment for themselves.\n\nMaster Ma Yuanyue\nMaster named Jian, a native of Fufeng.\nBefore coming of age, he entered the Dao, emerging from Master Sun’s gate.\nHe received the *Five Thousand Characters of Perfect Scripture* and the *Three Hundred Secret Glyphs*, along with the arts of wind divination and avian omens.\nHe could summon and command the myriad spirits, subdue and restrain drought demons—thus the four quarters vied in admiration.\nMaster Sun admonished him: “The more your arts and techniques proliferate, the more your reputation spreads abroad. This may attract the proud but can also entangle the enlightened.”\nSoon after, Yao Chang sent envoys to summon him, but the master claimed illness and refused to rise. He shut his gate and entered the mountains.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhat summons could make him comply?\nHow could court or countryside ever claim him?\nHe tucked the celestial script into his sleeve and withdrew deep into seclusion—\nOn Mount Zhongnan, he listens to the pines in the wind.\n\nPerfected Yin Lingjian\nPerfected One named Tong, a descendant of the Perfected One of Grand Harmony.\nFrom youth, he revered his ancestor’s Dao and gazed upon the blessed courts.\nHe paid homage to Master Ma, secretly receiving subtle teachings.\nWithin, he was replete; without, he flourished—his reputation grew daily.\nEmperor Taiwu of the Wei sent envoys with gifts, their requests for audience unceasing.\nEminent persons and scholars, officials of court and countryside, filled his gate with carriages, the roads with caps and canopies.\nThey sought the mystery and inquired of the Dao, returning empty-handed in form but full in spirit.\nAt a hundred, he released his form. Every night, several divine lamps hovered above his tomb, multiplying on days of abstinence.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFrom a noble house generation after generation, immortal talent arose—\nHe extended his hand to the red dust, responding to transformations.\nThe Yellow Writ returned in its time to one of the Dao,\nAdorned with starry hairpins and jade pendants, he illumined the towers and terraces.\n\nMaster Wang Daoyi\nMaster, a native of Bingzhou.\nDuring the Taihe era of the Wei, he studied under Lord Niu Wen.\nThe master’s Dao flourished and his conduct expanded, his affairs often marked by profound resonance.\nOnce, when repairing a temple, his followers gathered in great numbers.\nThough the granaries were vast, their contents were drawn upon endlessly, never depleted.\nHis disciples, curious, observed him and saw several youths in blue robes secretly replenishing the grain with baskets of rice.\nWhen others found climbing ladders and peering about laborious, they offered to build steps for convenience, but the master rebuked them and forbade it.\nThe poor and destitute all came to eat.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\n\"Bearing grain to replenish the granary, they saw the youths in blue—\nThis tale, passed down, is most strange indeed.\nYet it won him full refectories and alms for the multitude,\nWhile the hundred birds bearing blossoms in their beaks did so in vain.\"\n\n**Mother Shi Guangfa Master**\nThe Master, a native of Qi,\nFrom\n\nThe Emperor was pleased and later bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Master of Pure Virtue*. The twin scholar trees flanking the palace—named *Examine-Virtue* and *Tame-Tiger*—remain to this day as they were in his time.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nStrolling the market with a tiger in tow,\nHis wondrous powers astounded the crowd.\nThough the cultured sovereign sought to bestow renown,\nThe Master of Pure Virtue would not be bound.\n\n**Perfected Person Li Shunxing**\nThe Perfected Person was a native of Jingzhao. Endowed with innate wisdom from birth, he studied under the Master of Pure Virtue. Entering the mountains, he encountered three great immortals who bestowed upon him the *Elixir Treasure*. After six years of refinement and cultivation, his transformations became unfathomable. His fame reached Emperor Wen of Wei, who summoned him to undergo various trials—walking through fire and boiling water unscathed. When commanderies held rituals, he arrived at all on the same day. Some saw him crushed to death only to reappear; others witnessed him foretell rebellions. Though he later manifested his ascension, when his coffin was opened, only emptiness remained. A shrine was erected at the site, where incense and offerings are made to his image.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe immortal’s wondrous arts know no bounds,\nAmusing himself among mortals for countless rounds.\nDispersing qi or gathering form—nothing beyond his might,\nFor being and non-being transcend life and death’s plight.\n\n**Master Zhang Fayue**\nThe Master, a native of Nanyang, served as an attendant to Master Yin from childhood, diligently tending to his needs. The true adept, moved by his perseverance, imparted to him the essentials of the Dao. On the night of his oath beneath the open sky, divine lamps illuminated the four directions. During the reign of Emperor Fei of the Later Wei, he secluded himself in Geng Valley, where none could approach. Amid wind-swept pavilions and moonlit terraces, he rejoiced in the Dao, his cares forgotten. Once, a fierce tiger entered his chamber, yet he remained unperturbed, and the beast did him no harm. He kept a thousand rare birds, which he called to perch upon his hand to feed, utterly without fear or suspicion—a testament to his unadorned wholeness.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nDelighting in the Dao, he sat or walked in the mountains,\nHis mind free of scheming, beasts and birds untroubled by alarm.\n\nIn the radiant age of Huaxu, men lived in bliss,\nA scene of pristine harmony no brush could portray.\n\n**Master of Profound Contemplation, Perfected One Wei**\nThe Perfected One, named Jie, styled Chuxuan, was a native of Duling. Early in life, he gained renown for his talent and served as a calligrapher in the Eastern Palace of Emperor Ming of Wei. At thirty-eight, he claimed illness and retired into seclusion. Later, he donned the robes of a Daoist and traveled with Master Zhao the Alchemist, composing over a hundred volumes of commentaries on the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*. When Emperor Wu of Zhou visited the temple to perform the jiao offering, he admired the Perfected One’s bearing and commanded him to expound the teachings. Thereupon, the Perfected One elucidated the principles of Heaven and humanity, illuminating the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness. The emperor honored him as the *Master of Profound Contemplation*, and he was also known as the *Master of Guanzhong*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFleeing fame, he returned to the land of white clouds,\nDew-dipped brush in hand, he annotated Lao and Zhuang.\nYet Guanzhong called him Master,\nAnd his name vexed even lords and kings.\n\n**Dharma Master Hou Faxian**\nThe Dharma Master, named Kai, was a native of Jingzhao. During the Zhengshi era of Wei, he reverently received the Dao from the Venerable Zhenyi and served his master’s gate for thirty years, steadfast and untiring. After his master’s passing, he entered Cold Valley to build a hermitage. There, the springs were sweet, the trees lush, and the surroundings serene—a place he named Three Pines Abbey. Disciples gathered in pursuit of the Dao, living on wild plants and stream water, forgetting the distinctions of the world, their joy evoking the spirit of the ancient sages Chao and Xu. Those afflicted by malevolent spirits came seeking aid, and with talismans, he dispelled their harm, restoring peace without fail.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHidden in Three Pines Abbey amid deep white clouds,\nHis bearing echoed the ancient heart of Chao and Xu.\nDrinking from waterfalls, eating mountain herbs, content in simplicity,\nA single mat of pure breeze was worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Master of Dignified Conduct, Perfected One Wang**\nThe Perfected One, named Yan, was a native of Fufeng. From youth, he served Master Zhenyi. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, as the teachings of the Mysterious were about to fade, the Perfected One sought audience to discourse on the Dao, distinguishing the true from the peripheral, and was thus selected as one of the Ten Elders. When the Sui dynasty rose, Emperor Wen sent an honored carriage to summon him to the Daxing Palace. After fasting and purification, the emperor received the Dao and bestowed upon him the title *Master of Dignified Conduct*, establishing the Mysterious Capital Abbey for him to reside in. From then on, the gates of the Mysterious flourished. To his intimates, he said: “The Dao befits emperors and kings; our lineage is no longer pure. Why not return to rest?” Thereupon, he retired to his old mountain.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWeary of the golden gates and daily feasts,\nHe soared on a crane back to Penglai.\nIn the Mysterious Capital Abbey, spring had no master,\nA thousand peach trees bloomed in emerald solitude.\n\n**Dharma Master Yan Daotong**\nThe Dharma Master, named Da, was a native of Fufeng. His mastery of the Mysterious Learning was vast, earning him the esteem of his age. Emperor Wu of Zhou summoned him to court and treated him with the rites due a guest. In the fourth year of Jiande, as the emperor prepared to suppress the Daoist and Buddhist teachings, the court deliberated without resolution. A decree was issued to seek his counsel. The Dharma Master presented his case, distinguishing the primary from the secondary, and the emperor was greatly pleased. He specially commanded the construction of the Abiding Dao Abbey at his former hermitage in Tiangu, selecting nine eminent Daoists to reside there. Thus, the world came to know them as the Ten Elders of Tiangu. At ninety-five, he transcended the mortal realm within the abbey.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe Kunlun peaks’ jade and stone burned together in autumn’s blaze,\nDebates surged like rippling waves, stirring the court’s grace.\nWith mighty force he raised the sagging net of the Dao,\nA thousand jun lifted upon a single thread’s trace.\n\n**Dharma Master Yu Changwen**\nThe Dharma Master, named Zhang, was a native of Fufeng. In his youth, he could recite Daoist scriptures, and at his parents’ behest, he studied under Dharma Master Hou. Later, when the two teachings faced suppression and abolition, though he endured hardship and peril, he did not alter his resolve with fortune’s rise or fall. Soon, his name was noted by the court. The emperor, with a decree from his heart, appointed him a Great Virtue and bestowed upon him the title *Xi*, residing at the Abiding Dao Abbey—thus one of the Ten Elders. He often used talismans and incantations to dispel myriad afflictions for others, his divine marvels manifold. In the tenth year of Sui Daye, at eighty-two, he transcended the mortal realm. As he lay in stillness, a white bird flew from his coffin.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHigh in virtue, he spoke of the Ten Elders in years past,\nBy imperial decree he dwelt at Abiding Dao, honored and vast.\nHow, when all trees wither in decay,\nDoes the lone pine stand tall amid the snow’s array?\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of Radiant Purple and Gold, Qi Dharma Master**\nThe Dharma Master, named Hui, styled Pingding, was a native of Youhu. He received ordination under Dharma Master Su. During the late Sui, as Emperor Yang observed affairs, he told his disciples: “The Dao of Heaven is about to change; a descendant of the Old Lord shall soon appear.” Before long, Gaozu entered the Pass. The emperor personally visited the abbey’s courtyard, commanding a grand offering. Auspicious signs manifested, and he summoned the master to sit and partake in a vegetarian feast. Their exchange resonated deeply, and he was appointed Grand Master of Radiant Purple and Gold, then made Grand Master of Ceremonial Affairs. The Louguan Abbey was renamed the Abbey of the Sagely Clan. At seventy-three, he led his disciples to the summit of Mount Taibai, then swiftly returned and transcended.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFortunate to meet the true sovereign, Heaven’s favor unfurled,\nDaoist rites and imperial decrees in harmonious swirl.\nThough the golden-purple immortals’ rank was not his prize,\nThe title of Grand Master still graced him with noble guise.\n\n---\n\n**Dharma Master Ju Guozhen**\nThe Dharma Master was a native of Wugong. At thirty, during the Sui Renshou era, he entered the Dao. He ate only vegetables, wore simple robes, and strictly upheld austerity. Hunger and cold never swayed his mind, nor did fame or profit touch his heart. When praised, he grew fearful; when insulted, he bowed and listened. Not only did he appear compliant, but his heart truly submitted—for the more the Dao flourished within, the softer his heart grew. The hermit Yi Sou saw him and said: “He seeks not to contend for empty qi at the edge of form, but only to gather true efficacy in word and intent. Such is Guozhen.” When insulted, he merely clasped his hands and listened.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHis heart aspired to transcend the world and roam with Heaven’s flow,\nWho in this realm could match his resolve’s glow?\nContent in coarse robes and meager fare, his joy untold,\nWhile others fret over vain concerns, their worries cold.\n\n---\n\n**Dharma Master Tian Shiwen**\nThe Dharma Master was a native of Eyi. At nineteen, in the seventh year of Sui Kaihuang, he underwent the trial of ordination and was vested as a Daoist. He studied under Master Huayang, receiving the true instructions of Inner Observation and the Contemplation of Stillness. Whenever he entered seclusion to refine and transform, he would remain for months, closing his door without emerging. Upon exit, his complexion grew ever more radiant. He aided others with talismans and methods—sometimes reviving the dead, sometimes rescuing the drowning—his divine responses frequently manifest. At seventy-five, he transcended. The assembly witnessed a jeweled canopy and feathered regalia ascend into the void.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFor months in seclusion, his door remained sealed tight,\nYet divine light pierced the jade flask’s night.\nOnce the crimson regalia soared into the sky,\nTo which palace of Penglai did he fly?\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of Silver and Azure Radiance, Master Yin**\nThe Venerable Master, named Wencao, styled Jingxian, was a native of Longyou. His talents and Dao were both refined, his reputation and brilliance widely renowned. In the second year of Yifeng, he was ordered to oversee the Abbey of the Sagely Clan. The following year, the emperor commanded a grand offering and personally performed the rites of obeisance. The emperor witnessed the Mysterious Origin riding a white horse in descent, and thus ordered the compilation of *The Sagely Record*. He was appointed Grand Master of Silver and Azure Radiance and served as Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. The master declined the office but accepted the title, composing works such as *The Great Dao’s Subjugation of Demons*. For further details, see Yuan Banqian’s *Stele of Daoist Conduct*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*The Sagely Record* completed, he knocked upon the emperor’s ear,\nThe high rank of Silver and Azure Radiance brought him honor near.\nThough his luminous writings fade not with time’s flight,\nThrough Daoist histories, his name shines bright.\n\n---\n\n**Zhengyi Tongzhen Liang Perfected**\nThe Perfected, named Quan, served as abbey overseer during the Zhou Xiande era. At the time, Chen Tuan resided at the Xianyou Abbey, and the two, living in close proximity, became friends of the forest’s shade. When the Song dynasty revolutionized the mandate, the Sagely True Lord descended upon Mount Zhongnan, commanding Zhang Shouzhen to enter the Dao. He said: “I am your celestial teacher; you shall have another teacher in the human realm.” Zhang then bowed to the Perfected as his master. In the Kaibao era, an imperial edict conferred upon him the title *Zhengyi Tongzhen Perfected*. In the third year of Taiping Xingguo, he shed his mortal form.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe celestial True Lord long knew his name,\nYet Zhang had another teacher in the world’s frame.\nA lifetime in the forest, unseen by the crowd,\nOnly Chen Tuan recognized him—proud.\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of the Teaching, Perfected Yin of Qinghe**\nThe Grand Master, named Zhiping, styled Dahe, was a native of Donglai and the sixth patriarch of the Quanzhen lineage. He inherited and upheld the true teaching, his Dao harmonizing China and beyond. In the *renchen* year, as the Jin dynasty’s fate ended, Qin became a battleground. Cities turned to ruins, and the abbey lay in ruins. The master, mindful of the ancestral land where the teaching began, journeyed from Yan and devoted himself to its restoration. Daoist followers from all directions gathered without summons. Soon, he entrusted abbey affairs to Perfected Li, but before long, the halls and pavilions soared anew, and he returned to the old abbey. For details, see the *Stele of Daoist Conduct*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Dharma seal raised high, its wonders proclaimed,\nHow could a thatched hut compare to the Hall of Mystery’s frame?\nAs the immortal source flowed into the Quanzhen sea,\nThe Gatekeeper’s lineage flourished eternally.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Li of Hongmiao, One with the Dust**\nThe Perfected, named Zhirou, styled Qianshu, was a native of Zhushui. He studied under Perfected Li of Kaixuan, renounced worldly entanglements, and secluded himself in the mountains to refine his practice. His Dao perfected and conduct renowned, he became a model for all. When the calamity of Yang Tianxing struck, the abbey was reduced to ashes. In the *bing* year, the Perfected received the command of Qinghe, leading his disciples with tireless effort to rebuild. Overgrown paths were cleared, ruins restored, and the jade halls renewed—surpassing even their former glory. Disciples flocked like clouds, and he was enfeoffed as *Perfected of Hongmiao, One with the Dust*. At seventy-eight, he shed his mortal form.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSwift as spirits, ruins rise complete,\nJade towers and jeweled halls—all made new.\nOnce more, Yin and Li meet again—\nI fear these men of today are the ancients reborn.\n\nThe Louguan Abbey was the foundational ground of the world’s Daoist groves. Since the ascension of the Supreme Master Wen Shi, those who attained perfection have never ceased through the ages. Perusing the histories of the immortals, their numbers are beyond count. Initially, during the Jin dynasty, Lord Yin of Taihe composed the *Biographies of the Former Masters of Louguan*. Later, the Dhyāna Master Wei Jingsi expanded upon it, and at the end of the Zhou, the Venerable Yin Wencao of the Tang continued the work. Together, they recorded thirty individuals, each with their own biographical account, compiling a three-volume work that has endured through the ages.\n\nIn the *jimao* year of the Zhiyuan era, Xiangxian arrived from the Zheyou region to pay homage at the ancestral sanctuary. During his summer retreat at the Scripture Terrace, he became intimately familiar with the text. Thus, he recognized that the numinosity of the land and the excellence of its people stemmed from a deep and enduring source—truly no mere coincidence. Yet, as the existing records were scattered and incomplete, he abridged the nine superfluous sections, distilled the essential one, appended eulogies to each, and consolidated them into this stele.\n\nAdditionally, he compiled the *Primary Biography of Wen Shi*, placing it at the forefront to present to Abbot Nie and Superintendent Zhao. It was then engraved in enduring stone to illuminate the path for endless generations, that future descendants might thoroughly comprehend the ancestral Dao and be exhorted thereby.\n\nRespectfully inscribed and composed by Zhu Xiangxian of Maoshan.\n\n*The Stele Record of the Immortals and Perfected of Successive Dynasties at the Scripture Terrace of Mount Zhongnan* is hereby complete.",

One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Jizhuan* Category.\n\nThe Most High Perfected of the Nine Heavens and Celestial Earl, Master Wenshi, the Supreme Perfected—\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Inner Transmission*, the Perfected One bore the surname Yin, given name Xi, and courtesy name Gongwen, a native of Tianshui. His mother, née Lu, dreamed of celestial lightning coiling around her body before the Perfected One was born. At his birth, twin beams of light like suns danced beside him. His eyes held the essence of the sun, and his form was tall and refined. From youth, he delighted in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the *Searches*, the *Plain Questions*, and the *Book of Changes*, excelling in celestial portents and esoteric weft-texts. Gazing above and below, nothing escaped his penetrating insight; even the transformations of ghosts and spirits could not conceal their truths from him. Of magnanimous and heroic bearing, he concealed his virtue and practiced benevolence.\n\nLater, he wandered through mountains and rivers, and in the village of Wenxian in Gaizu County, within the divine precincts of Yongzhou’s Mount Zhongnan, he built a thatched hut, refining his spirit in pursuit of the supreme Dao. Though he sought no fame, his reclusive renown spread far. King Kang of Zhou, hearing of him, appointed him Grand Master, later summoning him to serve as a guest-friend in the Eastern Palace. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao’s reign (the *guichou* year), he beheld a purple qi advancing westward from the east and knew a sage would pass through the capital. Thus, he requested appointment as Magistrate of Hangu Pass to await him.\n\nWhen the appointed time came, he purified himself, observed the precepts of the Perfected, instructed the gatekeepers, swept the roads, and burned incense to await the arrival of the Celestial Perfected. On the *jiazi* day of the seventh month that year, the Old Master arrived at the pass. The Perfected One donned his court robes to welcome him, prepared a seat in his lodging, and served him facing north. Thereupon, he resigned on grounds of illness and retired from office. In the twelfth month of that year, he invited the Old Master to his estate on Mount Zhongnan, where he fasted, sought the Dao, and entreated him to compose a scripture for the enlightenment of later generations. The Old Master then expounded the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue* and transmitted to him the Way of Inner Cultivation of the Three Ones, along with the secret of the *Western Ascension*.\n\nAfter the transmission of the Dao was complete, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month of the following year (*jiayin*), the Old Master prepared to take leave and ascend to heaven. The Perfected One, grief-stricken, begged him to stay. The Old Master admonished him, saying: \"You must purify yourself for a thousand days, study and recite these two scrolls, refine your form to enter the subtle, and only then may you seek me at the market of the Green Ram in Shu Commandery.\" The Perfected One assented and bowed in gratitude.\n\nWith these words, upon a small hill south of his dwelling, the Old Master mounted the clouds, rode the radiance, and ascended into the Great Subtlety.",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One then retired to a thatched hut to purify himself in solitude, cutting off all worldly affairs. Within three years, his mind congealed and his form dissolved, his body entering a state of natural spontaneity. He mastered the subtleties of calculation and transformation, the principles of unifying form and multiplying spirit—all attaining their utmost wonder. Thereupon, he composed nine scrolls, entitled *Master Guan of the Pass*. He then journeyed to the market of the Green Ram in Shu Commandery to meet the Old Master. The Old Master bestowed upon him the title *Master of the Literary Beginning* and appointed him as the Supreme Perfected One, commanding all celestial immortals and transcendents.\n\nThe present Green Ram Palace in Chengdu Prefecture stands upon its former site. According to the *Origins of the Louguan Tradition*, Louguan was originally the residence of Lord Guan, a minister of King Kang of Zhou. He wove thatch into a tower to observe the stars and contemplate the *qi*, hence its name, Louguan. This marked the beginning of such temples and monasteries. Here, the transmission of the Dao and the bestowal of scriptures gave rise to the great teaching. Thus, the ancient sages and later worthies, venerating the lofty Perfected Ones, revered the Dao and virtue as the source of life and transformation, and honored immortality as the foundation of their teachings. They sought the traces of the myriad wonders and aspired to the ultimate return of the profound mystery.\n\nKing Mu of Zhou, during his western tour, and the First Emperor of Qin, during his eastern hunt, both turned their chariots from their paths to personally pay homage to the true lineage. The First Emperor built a temple south of the tower, Emperor Wu of Han erected a palace north of the observatory, and the Jin and Song dynasties offered inscribed tablets—some of which remain to this day. From the Qin and Han onward, temple households continued without interruption, for all dynasties revered this blessed site. Those who ascended to transcendence and attained the Dao have never been lacking. What is recorded here merely recounts old traditions; the deeds of those near and far cannot all be exhaustively investigated. The transmitted records are lengthy, so only the essentials are excerpted.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOf old, the Perfected One,\nDwelt in a tower, nurturing tranquility.\nA green ox drew his carriage,\nA purple aura heralded his gaze.\nReceiving the scriptures, he grasped their essence,\nUnveiling the Dao’s hidden depths.\nA single wave of the mysterious tide\nSpread its gradual flow across the four seas.\nNorth of Mount Zhongnan,\nHis abode left behind a grand legacy.\nThe teaching, revered through the ages,\nIts branches flourished through generations.\nInheriting the sages’ wisdom,\nPlumbing the profound’s profundity.\nGreat are the nine scrolls,\nIlluminating our posterity.\n\n**Du Yang Palace’s Supreme Harmony Lord Yin, the Perfected One**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Gui, courtesy name Gongdu, a disciple of Master of the Literary Beginning. He served his master early and received the wonders of the Dao in person. Upon attaining the Dao, the Supreme One summoned him to Supreme Harmony, where he governed the celestial bureaucracy at Du Yang Palace, reviewing the *Illustrated Records of True Immortals*, inspecting the divine offices and ghostly officials, wielding authority over the thousand spirits, and purifying the myriad ghosts. At times, he roamed the seas and mountains; at others, he ascended to pay homage in the Jade Capital. During the Yongxing era of the Jin, he descended again to this observatory, where the Daoist Liang Chen encountered him and received a cinnabar scripture before his departure.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe immortal, now risen to celestial ranks,\nHis cinnabar furnace beneath the pines, overgrown with green moss.\nWho could have foreseen, a thousand years hence,\nHe would return to his old home to bestow the scriptures again.\n\n**Mount Wangwu’s Supreme Ultimate Lord Du, the Perfected One**\nThe Perfected One’s name was Chong, a native of Haojing. At barely twenty, having heard of the Master of the Literary Beginning’s attainment of the Dao, he came to study under him. The Master was then in Shu, residing in the thatched hut of the Perfected One’s abode. King Mu, longing to follow the traces of immortals, commanded his chariot to visit, building an observatory and appointing Chong and six others as Daoists. After completing his refinement and cultivation, his body emanated jade-like radiance, his five viscera were replete, his appearance and breath harmonized, and he dissolved his fetal bonds and untied his knots, penetrating the wonders of the myriad things. In the year *jihai* of King Yi, he ascended. He was tasked with governing the immortals of Mount Wangwu.\n\n**Eulogy:**",

He received the Dao from Perfected Yao the Immortal and was called his foremost disciple. Once, he played the *se* zither and blew the *sheng* pipes with Prince Jin, eldest son of King Ling of Zhou, roaming together through Shang and Luo. With a single string, he could evoke the harmony of all eight tones—clashing bronze and chiming jade—while a hundred birds danced in unison.

Diligent in burning incense and reciting scriptures, when the censer’s fragrance was exhausted, a numinous darkness arose of its own; when the lamp’s oil ran dry, divine radiance still gleamed in the void. Once, he cast a talisman into the river, and the waters flowed backward. The First Emperor of Qin visited his temple to pay homage, ordering a hall built facing east and attendants assigned to sweep and tend the grounds.

      "translated_text": "In the radiant age of Huaxu, men lived in bliss,\nA scene of pristine harmony no brush could portray.\n\n**Master of Profound Contemplation, Perfected One Wei**\nThe Perfected One, named Jie, styled Chuxuan, was a native of Duling. Early in life, he gained renown for his talent and served as a calligrapher in the Eastern Palace of Emperor Ming of Wei. At thirty-eight, he claimed illness and retired into seclusion. Later, he donned the robes of a Daoist and traveled with Master Zhao the Alchemist, composing over a hundred volumes of commentaries on the *Book of Changes* and the *Laozi*. When Emperor Wu of Zhou visited the temple to perform the jiao offering, he admired the Perfected One’s bearing and commanded him to expound the teachings. Thereupon, the Perfected One elucidated the principles of Heaven and humanity, illuminating the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness. The emperor honored him as the *Master of Profound Contemplation*, and he was also known as the *Master of Guanzhong*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFleeing fame, he returned to the land of white clouds,\nDew-dipped brush in hand, he annotated Lao and Zhuang.\nYet Guanzhong called him Master,\nAnd his name vexed even lords and kings.\n\n**Dharma Master Hou Faxian**\nThe Dharma Master, named Kai, was a native of Jingzhao. During the Zhengshi era of Wei, he reverently received the Dao from the Venerable Zhenyi and served his master’s gate for thirty years, steadfast and untiring. After his master’s passing, he entered Cold Valley to build a hermitage. There, the springs were sweet, the trees lush, and the surroundings serene—a place he named Three Pines Abbey. Disciples gathered in pursuit of the Dao, living on wild plants and stream water, forgetting the distinctions of the world, their joy evoking the spirit of the ancient sages Chao and Xu. Those afflicted by malevolent spirits came seeking aid, and with talismans, he dispelled their harm, restoring peace without fail.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHidden in Three Pines Abbey amid deep white clouds,\nHis bearing echoed the ancient heart of Chao and Xu.\nDrinking from waterfalls, eating mountain herbs, content in simplicity,\nA single mat of pure breeze was worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Master of Dignified Conduct, Perfected One Wang**\nThe Perfected One, named Yan, was a native of Fufeng. From youth, he served Master Zhenyi. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, as the teachings of the Mysterious were about to fade, the Perfected One sought audience to discourse on the Dao, distinguishing the true from the peripheral, and was thus selected as one of the Ten Elders. When the Sui dynasty rose, Emperor Wen sent an honored carriage to summon him to the Daxing Palace. After fasting and purification, the emperor received the Dao and bestowed upon him the title *Master of Dignified Conduct*, establishing the Mysterious Capital Abbey for him to reside in. From then on, the gates of the Mysterious flourished. To his intimates, he said: “The Dao befits emperors and kings; our lineage is no longer pure. Why not return to rest?” Thereupon, he retired to his old mountain.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWeary of the golden gates and daily feasts,\nHe soared on a crane back to Penglai.\nIn the Mysterious Capital Abbey, spring had no master,\nA thousand peach trees bloomed in emerald solitude.\n\n**Dharma Master Yan Daotong**\nThe Dharma Master, named Da, was a native of Fufeng. His mastery of the Mysterious Learning was vast, earning him the esteem of his age. Emperor Wu of Zhou summoned him to court and treated him with the rites due a guest. In the fourth year of Jiande, as the emperor prepared to suppress the Daoist and Buddhist teachings, the court deliberated without resolution. A decree was issued to seek his counsel. The Dharma Master presented his case, distinguishing the primary from the secondary, and the emperor was greatly pleased. He specially commanded the construction of the Abiding Dao Abbey at his former hermitage in Tiangu, selecting nine eminent Daoists to reside there. Thus, the world came to know them as the Ten Elders of Tiangu. At ninety-five, he transcended the mortal realm within the abbey.\n\n**Eulogy:**",

Once, a fierce tiger entered his chamber, yet he remained unperturbed, and the beast did him no harm. He kept a thousand rare birds, which he called to perch upon his hand to feed, utterly without fear or suspicion—a testament to his unadorned wholeness.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nDelighting in the Dao, he sat or walked in the mountains,\nHis mind free of scheming, beasts and birds untroubled by alarm.",

      "translated_text": "The Kunlun peaks’ jade and stone burned together in autumn’s blaze,\nDebates surged like rippling waves, stirring the court’s grace.\nWith mighty force he raised the sagging net of the Dao,\nA thousand jun lifted upon a single thread’s trace.\n\n**Dharma Master Yu Changwen**\nThe Dharma Master, named Zhang, was a native of Fufeng. In his youth, he could recite Daoist scriptures, and at his parents’ behest, he studied under Dharma Master Hou. Later, when the two teachings faced suppression and abolition, though he endured hardship and peril, he did not alter his resolve with fortune’s rise or fall. Soon, his name was noted by the court. The emperor, with a decree from his heart, appointed him a Great Virtue and bestowed upon him the title *Xi*, residing at the Abiding Dao Abbey—thus one of the Ten Elders. He often used talismans and incantations to dispel myriad afflictions for others, his divine marvels manifold. In the tenth year of Sui Daye, at eighty-two, he transcended the mortal realm. As he lay in stillness, a white bird flew from his coffin.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHigh in virtue, he spoke of the Ten Elders in years past,\nBy imperial decree he dwelt at Abiding Dao, honored and vast.\nHow, when all trees wither in decay,\nDoes the lone pine stand tall amid the snow’s array?\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of Radiant Purple and Gold, Qi Dharma Master**\nThe Dharma Master, named Hui, styled Pingding, was a native of Youhu. He received ordination under Dharma Master Su. During the late Sui, as Emperor Yang observed affairs, he told his disciples: “The Dao of Heaven is about to change; a descendant of the Old Lord shall soon appear.” Before long, Gaozu entered the Pass. The emperor personally visited the abbey’s courtyard, commanding a grand offering. Auspicious signs manifested, and he summoned the master to sit and partake in a vegetarian feast. Their exchange resonated deeply, and he was appointed Grand Master of Radiant Purple and Gold, then made Grand Master of Ceremonial Affairs. The Louguan Abbey was renamed the Abbey of the Sagely Clan. At seventy-three, he led his disciples to the summit of Mount Taibai, then swiftly returned and transcended.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFortunate to meet the true sovereign, Heaven’s favor unfurled,\nDaoist rites and imperial decrees in harmonious swirl.\nThough the golden-purple immortals’ rank was not his prize,\nThe title of Grand Master still graced him with noble guise.\n\n---\n\n**Dharma Master Ju Guozhen**\nThe Dharma Master was a native of Wugong. At thirty, during the Sui Renshou era, he entered the Dao. He ate only vegetables, wore simple robes, and strictly upheld austerity. Hunger and cold never swayed his mind, nor did fame or profit touch his heart. When praised, he grew fearful; when insulted, he bowed and listened. Not only did he appear compliant, but his heart truly submitted—for the more the Dao flourished within, the softer his heart grew. The hermit Yi Sou saw him and said: “He seeks not to contend for empty qi at the edge of form, but only to gather true efficacy in word and intent. Such is Guozhen.” When insulted, he merely clasped his hands and listened.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHis heart aspired to transcend the world and roam with Heaven’s flow,\nWho in this realm could match his resolve’s glow?\nContent in coarse robes and meager fare, his joy untold,\nWhile others fret over vain concerns, their worries cold.\n\n---\n\n**Dharma Master Tian Shiwen**\nThe Dharma Master was a native of Eyi. At nineteen, in the seventh year of Sui Kaihuang, he underwent the trial of ordination and was vested as a Daoist. He studied under Master Huayang, receiving the true instructions of Inner Observation and the Contemplation of Stillness. Whenever he entered seclusion to refine and transform, he would remain for months, closing his door without emerging. Upon exit, his complexion grew ever more radiant. He aided others with talismans and methods—sometimes reviving the dead, sometimes rescuing the drowning—his divine responses frequently manifest. At seventy-five, he transcended. The assembly witnessed a jeweled canopy and feathered regalia ascend into the void.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFor months in seclusion, his door remained sealed tight,\nYet divine light pierced the jade flask’s night.\nOnce the crimson regalia soared into the sky,\nTo which palace of Penglai did he fly?\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of Silver and Azure Radiance, Master Yin**\nThe Venerable Master, named Wencao, styled Jingxian, was a native of Longyou. His talents and Dao were both refined, his reputation and brilliance widely renowned. In the second year of Yifeng, he was ordered to oversee the Abbey of the Sagely Clan. The following year, the emperor commanded a grand offering and personally performed the rites of obeisance. The emperor witnessed the Mysterious Origin riding a white horse in descent, and thus ordered the compilation of *The Sagely Record*. He was appointed Grand Master of Silver and Azure Radiance and served as Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. The master declined the office but accepted the title, composing works such as *The Great Dao’s Subjugation of Demons*. For further details, see Yuan Banqian’s *Stele of Daoist Conduct*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*The Sagely Record* completed, he knocked upon the emperor’s ear,\nThe high rank of Silver and Azure Radiance brought him honor near.\nThough his luminous writings fade not with time’s flight,\nThrough Daoist histories, his name shines bright.\n\n---\n\n**Zhengyi Tongzhen Liang Perfected**\nThe Perfected, named Quan, served as abbey overseer during the Zhou Xiande era. At the time, Chen Tuan resided at the Xianyou Abbey, and the two, living in close proximity, became friends of the forest’s shade. When the Song dynasty revolutionized the mandate, the Sagely True Lord descended upon Mount Zhongnan, commanding Zhang Shouzhen to enter the Dao. He said: “I am your celestial teacher; you shall have another teacher in the human realm.” Zhang then bowed to the Perfected as his master. In the Kaibao era, an imperial edict conferred upon him the title *Zhengyi Tongzhen Perfected*. In the third year of Taiping Xingguo, he shed his mortal form.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe celestial True Lord long knew his name,\nYet Zhang had another teacher in the world’s frame.\nA lifetime in the forest, unseen by the crowd,\nOnly Chen Tuan recognized him—proud.\n\n---\n\n**Grand Master of the Teaching, Perfected Yin of Qinghe**\nThe Grand Master, named Zhiping, styled Dahe, was a native of Donglai and the sixth patriarch of the Quanzhen lineage. He inherited and upheld the true teaching, his Dao harmonizing China and beyond. In the *renchen* year, as the Jin dynasty’s fate ended, Qin became a battleground. Cities turned to ruins, and the abbey lay in ruins. The master, mindful of the ancestral land where the teaching began, journeyed from Yan and devoted himself to its restoration. Daoist followers from all directions gathered without summons. Soon, he entrusted abbey affairs to Perfected Li, but before long, the halls and pavilions soared anew, and he returned to the old abbey. For details, see the *Stele of Daoist Conduct*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Dharma seal raised high, its wonders proclaimed,\nHow could a thatched hut compare to the Hall of Mystery’s frame?\nAs the immortal source flowed into the Quanzhen sea,\nThe Gatekeeper’s lineage flourished eternally.\n\n---\n\n**Perfected Li of Hongmiao, One with the Dust**\nThe Perfected, named Zhirou, styled Qianshu, was a native of Zhushui. He studied under Perfected Li of Kaixuan, renounced worldly entanglements, and secluded himself in the mountains to refine his practice. His Dao perfected and conduct renowned, he became a model for all. When the calamity of Yang Tianxing struck, the abbey was reduced to ashes. In the *bing* year, the Perfected received the command of Qinghe, leading his disciples with tireless effort to rebuild. Overgrown paths were cleared, ruins restored, and the jade halls renewed—surpassing even their former glory. Disciples flocked like clouds, and he was enfeoffed as *Perfected of Hongmiao, One with the Dust*. At seventy-eight, he shed his mortal form.",
