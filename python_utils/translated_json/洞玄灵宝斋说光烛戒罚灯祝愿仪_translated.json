  "full_translation": "**The *Dongxuan Lingbao Rites of Candlelight, Precepts, Penance, Lamps, and Vows***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Dongxuan Lingbao Exposition on the Rites of Candlelight, Precepts, Penance, Lamps, and Vows*\nComposed by Daoist Lu Xiujing of the Liu-Song dynasty. An essential treatise on the precepts and rituals of Lingbao fasts. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* section, *Weiyi* (Ritual Propriety) category.\n\n---\n\n### *Exposition on the Candlelight Fast (External Discourse)*\n**By Lu Xiujing**\n\nBefore assembling for the fast, one should retire to a private chamber, burn incense, and gird oneself to expound the rites.\n\n\"Candlelight\" (*juéguāng*) is akin to what Zhuangzi called a \"torch flame\"—a faint glimmer. The Dao of fasting is supremely refined, yet practitioners often remain coarse, for the five turbidities and defilements obscure and obstruct. Like dwelling in a dark cavern untouched by the sun, one must rely on the illumination of lamps and candles. This is the meaning of \"candlelight.\"\n\nHere, the great principles of fasting scriptures are outlined, and the essentials of the ritual body are presented concisely. The intent is to restrain the crude and vulgar, guiding them toward profound clarity. It is like a carpenter selecting wood: if a piece is warped, one must first trim its excess before applying the inked line. Alas, my own clumsiness has led to such prolixity—perhaps the grain of the wood is too gnarled for the master’s craft.\n\nWhen preparing for a fast or offering, one should first expound the rites in a private chamber, girding oneself and kindling incense according to the proper method.\n\nIn fasting, one must sit in silent reverence within a secluded chamber, mastering the passions and sealing the gates of the spirit to bar external distractions. Uphold the Ten Precepts to prevent worldly thoughts from arising. Cultivate a courageous and resolute heart, practicing the Ten Daoist Practices. Strengthen and stabilize the will so that it cannot be swayed. Immerse oneself in the profound and savor the true, ensuring every thought is pure—this is the essence of fasting.\n\n1. **Purify with fragrant water**, cleansing the five limbs with spirit and qi, making the nine orifices bright and clear. Clothe oneself in immaculate garments, both inner and outer, suffused with fragrance. Thus may the lofty perfected and the numinous void descend and draw near.\n\n2. **Abandon worldly affairs**, severing mundane entanglements. Withdraw from all distractions, both internal and external, embracing serene non-action. Body and mind at ease, focus the thoughts with single-minded devotion.\n\n3. **Moderate one’s diet**, curbing desires and cutting away excess. Balance hunger and satiety, harmonizing the viscera. Thus may the spirit and qi remain clear and tranquil, nurturing the primordial spring.\n\n4. **Maintain dignified bearing and proper attire**, conducting oneself with solemnity and reverence. Forsake arrogance and sloth, never neglecting diligence. In prostrations and supplications, fulfill each act with utmost devotion.\n\n5. **Seal the mouth and still the tongue**, refraining from idle speech. Regulate the voice and rectify the qi, reciting and chanting scriptures. Thus may one enlighten humans and spirits, resonating with immortals and sages.\n\n6. **Purify the heart and mind**, banishing wayward thoughts. Subdue the six senses and eradicate the Three Poisons. Concentrate the spirit on the true, penetrating the subtle and obscure.\n\n7. **Burn incense and waft its smoke**, sounding the drum to summon the gods. Thus may the Three Clarities hear above, and the Ten Directions be universally proclaimed.\n\n8. **Confess and repent transgressions**, beseeching and making vows. With a heart as sincere as cinnabar, humble and earnest, pour forth one’s pleas.\n\n9. **Cultivate great compassion**, pitying all beings beset by calamities, afflictions, and suffering. Vow to deliver them all, that in life and death they may know peace, free from sorrow.\n\n10. **In movement and stillness**, maintain grace and refinement. Guide one another with words, confining speech to the Dao, never straying from the Dharma. If one perceives a misstep or error, immediately correct it, prostrating to repent.\n\nThis is the *Lingbao Natural and Supreme Fast*.\n\n\"Ling\" means \"numinous.\" Its wondrous efficacy transcends thought and discourse, its transformations boundless—hence it is called \"ling.\"\n\n\"Bao\" means \"oneness.\" It is what the Three Powers attain, embodying purity, tranquility, and integrity. As it cannot be lost, it is called \"bao.\" Cling to it without parting, and myriad blessings will naturally converge. Deviate from it even for a moment, and misfortunes and chaos will swiftly gather. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, gain and loss—none can compel their arising, nor prevent their absence. Thus it is called \"natural.\"\n\nIt universally aids the Five Paths, delivering all beings, extinguishing the cycle of birth and death, and transcending the Three Realms—hence it is called \"supreme.\"\n\nThough mortals are not perfected beings, they dwell amidst the Five Turbidities, where the Three Corpses thrive, inwardly generating assailants. The nine orifices and four gates each pursue their own inclinations, and every action leads toward death, cutting short one’s heavenly years. Failing to fulfill one’s allotted lifespan, one commits evil and transgresses, accruing sins in the hidden courts. Thus, in this world, one suffers hardship, never escaping the cycle of human existence—plagued by hunger, cold, poverty, and lowliness, afflicted by illness, punishment, and calamity, enmeshed in misfortune. Only after death does one tread the path of suffering.\n\nFor this reason, the Most High Heavenly Worthy opened the Purple Tenuity Jade Tablets of the Upper Palace of the Mystery Capital and revealed the *Lingbao Wondrous Fasts*. As the three gates of humans are restless and unruly, prone to killing, theft, and lust, they are disciplined through prostrations. As the mouth utters evil words, frivolous speech, and double-tongued deceit, it is tasked with scripture recitation. As the heart harbors thoughts of greed, desire, anger, and resentment, it is directed to contemplate the spirit. Through these three methods, the heart is cleansed and conduct purified. When heart and conduct reach utmost refinement, this is the meaning of fasting.\n\nExtend benevolent vows and virtuous thoughts to amplify merit and karma. The resolve to uphold precepts must be like grasping a rope while falling into a well—never relinquished for even a moment. The commitment to the Dharma must be like reinforcing a crumbling dam—never allowing indolence. The devotion to practice must be like tending fertile fields—never wearying of cultivation. Day and night, uphold the precepts and revere the Dharma with tireless diligence. Thus may one resonate with the Great Mystery, drawing the descent of true numina. The Three Corpses will be expelled, and all demons subdued. With such vows, nothing will go unfulfilled; no aspiration will remain unachieved.\n\nThe age of sagely rule is rare to encounter, the scriptures and Dharma rare to hear, opportune moments rare to meet, and enlightened teachers rare to find. All you worthy ones, in past lives, possessed great fortune, bringing this auspicious convergence in your present existence. You have encountered the Three Treasures, heard the Dharma’s teachings, and embraced the pure and void. You have feasted on the numinous essence, your names already inscribed in the imperial registers of the Mystery Capital, recorded in golden script and jade tablets. You are the honored guests of the Heavenly Palace, the immortal companions of the Most High.\n\nNow you have ascended to the Dharma-seat, embraced the Dharma’s discipline, and made a virtuous beginning—why not bring it to fulfillment? Let us together steel our resolve, contend with indolence, uphold the Dharma’s teachings, and regard mindfulness as sublime practice. Exert yourselves with sincerity, heedless of weariness; a single day’s diligence will bring blessings across lifetimes.\n\nHuman life is perilous, the four elements unreliable; a century passes in an instant—how can it be considered long? When decrepitude suddenly arrives, eyes dim and ears grow deaf, afflictions multiply, and pain and distress entwine you, then even rising, sitting, breathing, or moving will require another’s strength. In such a state, will you still be able to advance in the Dao’s work, to partake in this Dharma-seat?\n\nTo lose this auspicious opportunity—when will the next arise? To sink into the depths of suffering—what use is regret? Reflect on these words, each for your own sake, and encourage one another to cross the perilous straits together.\n\nIf one’s past lives bear heavy sins and karmic adversaries, they will be enshrouded in obscuring veils, the six obstructions unopened, the mind narrow and perverse, the qi and nature contrary and rebellious. Deluded by the five desires, they see nothing beyond, indulging in rich flavors, sounds, and sights for fleeting pleasure. They detest goodness and envy the worthy, treating them like foes.\n\nSuch people, wherever they turn, are drawn to evil, forever estranged from the scriptures and teachings. Even if they encounter them, they do not believe. Seeing others revere and follow the Dao and Dharma, they call it delusion and join in mockery. The deaf do not hear the *Shao* and *Wu* melodies; the blind do not see white from black—can one say they are not afflicted?\n\nEven if some good understanding forcibly pulls them, it is not their true nature, and regret soon arises. They turn from truth toward falsehood, chasing after perverse spirits. Fleeting joy passes, while suffering lingers. These beings take the three wretched destinies as their path, the earthly prisons as their home. Forever lost in darkest night, they never behold the three luminaries. They embrace copper pillars, tread upon knife mountains, follow sword trees, plunge into cauldrons of boiling water, swallow fire and devour coals—through kalpas unending, no escape.\n\nEven if they are reborn, they fall into the forms of the six livestock, their bodies subjected to the cruelty of slaughter, their souls tormented in the three evil realms. Back and forth they drift, dragged through the currents—how pitiful!\n\n*Dharma Torch Treatise*\nBy Lu Xiujing\n\nAt the onset of establishing the fast, one begins by burning incense and lodging the evening petition, yet without contemplating before the deities, one faces east and declares it. *Dharma Torch*.\n\n\"Dharma\" denotes the compass and square, collectively termed \"Dharma.\" The compass draws the circle, the square carves the right angle—all things conform to them and thus attain correctness. \"Torch\" is an object of illumination, aiding the moon and supplementing the sun, dispelling dusk and brightening darkness. By its light, one gains sight.\n\nCrookedness and perversion lack Dharma and thus have no means to rectify themselves; applying Dharma without illumination yields no perception of gain or loss. To rectify, one cannot be without Dharma; to apply Dharma, one cannot be without light. To settle oneself, one cannot forgo the fast; the fast cannot proceed without this text. This text serves as the *Dharma Torch*, guiding one through the Daoist canon to attain the true treasure.\n\nOf all things, humans are most noble; of humans, life is most precious. Life depends upon the spirit and qi. Spirit and qi within the human body govern the vitality of the four limbs. One cannot be without qi even for a moment, nor lose spirit in bowing or raising the head. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to collapse; losing qi brings sudden death. Qi and spirit ever accompany each other. Spirit and qi ever rely upon one another for strength. When spirit departs, qi perishes; when qi is severed, the body is lost.\n\nAll fear death and delight in life, yet do not know that the work of living lies in spirit and qi. Instead, they repeatedly agitate their minds, offend their qi, indulge their spirits, and wither their lives. They do not cherish stillness or preserve their true nature, thus bringing about their own ruin. How can one not treasure essence and guard qi to seek long-lasting vision, harmoniously nurturing all things to cultivate the blessings of branches and leaves?\n\nThe sage, seeing the people rushing headlong into the five desires and unable to settle themselves, established the fast as a method. Through affairs, one ceases affairs; through precepts, one restrains inner bandits; through威仪, one guards against external thieves. Ritual recitation engages body and speech, riding movement to return to stillness. Meditating on the spirit engages the mind, guiding existence to revert to emptiness. When stillness and emptiness are achieved, the Dao is harmonized. It is like reining in the hooves of a swift steed to align the chariot returning to truth.\n\nYan Zun said: \"Empty the mind to trace the origin of the Dao; still the qi to await the divine spirit.\" This is the meaning.\n\nYet scholars of the degenerate age value ornament and despise substance. Blessings lie in stillness, yet they seek them in motion; life rests within, yet they abandon themselves to external things. Such people, though eager to practice the fast, do not understand its methods. Or, understanding its methods, they do not recognize its form. Or, recognizing its form, they do not grasp its meaning. Or, grasping its meaning, they do not attain its intent. Confused and disordered, they act without restraint, drifting astray and losing their foundation, never awakening to themselves. It is like turning one’s back to a fierce wind and following a swift current, unaware of rowing back to the source, thus forever drowning in the sea of suffering—how lamentable!\n\nI have carefully gathered from the various scriptures and compiled them into ten chapters, to be applied during the fast, naming it *Dharma Torch*. The evening petition comprises one chapter; the six periods of ritual conduct, six chapters; the three periods of spirit meditation, three chapters. If the Dharma Master illuminates these to practice the fast, and all officials and hosts can empty their minds to receive them, then their sight and hearing will be clear, and they may glimpse the gate of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Dao is the name for the ultimate principle. Virtue is acting in accordance with principle. The scriptures are the paths of passage. The Dao is like a road; virtue, like good virtue; the scriptures, like measured paths; conduct, like walking; Dharma, like a model. Those who study the Dao must rely on Dharma to seek the scriptures, practice goodness to perfect virtue, and thus attain the Dao. Without performing meritorious deeds, merely guarding the One without wavering, one will never achieve the Dao. It is like a person sitting at home and not walking—how can they see the road?\n\nThe Dao, combined with three, completes virtue. Without fulfilling the three, nothing is accomplished. The three are: Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Benevolence is one. Performing meritorious deeds is two. Virtue sufficient to complete the Dao is three. When these three unite, one attains the Dao. If one merely performs meritorious deeds but does not understand the Dao, one does not attain the Dao. If one merely understands the Dao but lacks meritorious deeds, one does not attain the Dao. If one possesses Dao and virtue but lacks benevolence, the ultimate principle is obscured and returns to nothingness. It is like sowing grain, casting seed into the earth without water to moisten it—how can it grow? There is a ruler and ministers but no people—how can they govern? There is heaven and earth but no beings—how can they nurture? Thus, the *Five Thousand Words* states: \"The three give birth to the myriad things.\"\n\nThe selection of precepts, prohibitions, and penalties for the Upper Grade Ten Precepts follows the established texts of Master Lu. After completing the evening petition, next confer the Upper Grade Ten Precepts, all facing east and standing evenly. Recite the *Hymn of Wisdom*:\n\nWisdom arises from the rootless,\nProfound and transcending the ten directions.\nIt structures emptiness, towering in the mysterious firmament,\nAll heavens embrace its fragrant flow.\nIts wonder defies thought,\nIts numinous resonance truly connects.\nBeing is ultimately non-being,\nNon-being holds all without exception.\nWisdom ever observes the body,\nThe foremost in studying the Dao.\nSubtly entering profound contemplation,\nNaturally it records my spirit.\nThe Heavenly Worthy ever protects,\nThe demon kings pledge their guardianship.\nResplendent is the vajra body,\nLofty before the Most High.\nWisdom engenders the root of precepts,\nThe true Dao takes precepts as its master.\nFrom this the Three Treasures arise,\nRevered and received by the lofty sages.\nRiding this deathless boat,\nSwiftly crossing the great expanse.\nAt this moment of declaring the precepts,\nAll heavens come to bow their heads.\n\nAfter reciting, all turn north, prostrate fully, and repentantly bow to the ten directions, then return to face east and prostrate. The Dharma Master turns to face west, declaring the威仪 of the precepts.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao: \"Now is the time to universally proclaim the Dharma sound, awakening the multitude of beings. For all men and women, resolve disasters and avert calamities, invoke blessings and deliver lives, and eradicate the roots of all suffering.\"\n\nLet those living behold the Dao, their bodies freed from the eight difficulties; let the deceased rejoice, feasting in celestial halls, soon reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. Those who perform purification rites and seek the Dao must single-mindedly request and uphold the Ten Precepts, receiving them with clarity and never forgetting. Focus the mind in silent contemplation, penetrating the natural with profound reflection. Let no stray thoughts disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall listen in stillness.\n\nThe First Precept: Let the heart harbor no malice or jealousy, giving no rise to the thieves of yin. Guard the mouth and be cautious of transgressions, with thoughts ever fixed upon the Dharma.\n\nThe Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing, showing compassion and aiding all beings. Embrace kindness and extend salvation, nourishing all things.\n\nThe Third Precept: Maintain chastity and yield with righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Always act with good intentions, diminishing the self to aid others.\n\nThe Fourth Precept: Be free from lust and desire, the heart untouched by wantonness. Preserve purity and caution, with conduct unstained.\n\nThe Fifth Precept: Let the mouth utter no evil words, nor speech be ornate or deceitful. Be upright within and without, committing no transgressions of speech.\n\nThe Sixth Precept: Abstain from wine and moderate conduct, harmonizing qi and temperament. Let the spirit remain unharmed, avoiding all evils.\n\nThe Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you, nor contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, humbling yourself to deliver others.\n\nThe Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings, nor slander sacred texts. Receive the Dharma with reverence, ever as though in the presence of the divine.\n\nThe Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor men bear resentment, nor harm spirit and qi.\n\nThe Tenth Precept: In all actions and deeds, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people and gods, with conduct ever thus.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: Those who cultivate and uphold the pure precepts ever align with the heart of Heaven. Always practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from this world of suffering. Be humble and reverent in following the teachings, never slackening midway. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Thus unwavering, one may escape the five destinies and avoid the three evils. Protected by all heavens and revered by the myriad spirits, those who maintain the fast and uphold the precepts shall naturally attain deliverance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: The Dao is revered, the Dharma wondrous, and the human body likewise precious. Thus the Dao reveals the Dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver humanity. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to unite with the Dao. One should practice with diligence, observe the fast, and uphold the precepts. Calm the mind and still the thoughts, with aspirations clear and intent focused. Direct the will single-mindedly, without distraction. Purify the six viscera, abstaining from flavors beyond the mean. Be empty and pure within and without, ever in accord with the natural. On the day of the fast, hold incense and make vows, allowing the heart’s sincerity to ascend. The patrolling deities of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions shall descend to witness and listen to the Dharma sound, overseeing and reflecting upon your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao shall have their merits recorded in the heavens. Retribution for blessings and misfortunes shall be swiftly manifest. The Dao does not fail those who practice with diligence; receive the teachings earnestly and let no demonic words deceive.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: When establishing purification rites and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings shall arrive in flying clouds, riding eight-jade-carriaged green chariots, accompanied by perfected beings and jade maidens. They bear flower banners, leading with phoenix songs, followed by celestial music. White cranes and lions chant in harmony, burning incense and scattering flowers as they float through the air. They gaze upon those practicing the Dao, listening to the Dharma sound. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How can one not fully adhere to this method? First receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Move with refined and graceful steps, the mind serene and the intent composed. In sitting, rising, lying, and resting, never depart from proper decorum. The Heavenly Kings shall rejoice, and your name shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. This is truly attaining the Dao within the square inch of the heart.\n\nThe scripture states: To move Heaven and Earth, summon the host of spirits, commune with the immortal Dao, penetrate the utmost truth, dissolve accumulated sins of past lives, eradicate misfortune, repel vengeful foes, cultivate great virtue, heal illnesses, and deliver all beings—nothing surpasses the practice of purification rites and the recitation of scriptures. The fast is indeed the foundation of seeking the Dao; all accomplishments stem from it. Its merit is towering, beyond compare. Above, it enables ascension to immortality and attainment of the Dao; in the middle, it brings peace to the nation and the household, prolongs life, and secures blessings and prosperity, attaining the Dao of non-action. Below, it eliminates past transgressions, pardons present faults, rescues from distress, eases difficulties, dispels disasters and illnesses, liberates the deceased from suffering, and delivers all beings—nothing is inapt.\n\nThe scripture states: Among the great methods of purification rites, none surpasses the *Lingbao* Fast of the Most High. The *Lingbao* scriptures are the primordial root of Heaven and Earth, the gateway and window of the divine luminaries, the ancestor of all scriptures, and the bridge of boundless great Dharma. If one recites but a single sentence, its resonance shall pierce the nine heavens, and all gods shall pay homage while ghosts and spirits stand in awe. Its profundity and wonder are beyond declaration. None but the utmost good in the world can achieve it; none but the utmost faith can request it; none but the utmost sincerity can uphold it; none but the utmost talent can practice it.\n\nThe Most High holds it in the highest regard, and all perfected beings revere it—cast in golden characters, inscribed upon jade tablets, and sealed within the Supreme Great Luoxia Heaven, upon the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis, in the Purple Tenuity Palace’s Seven Treasures Mystic Terrace. This terrace is where the Most High presides. The Five Elders stand in attendance, the Ten Thousand Emperors pay homage to the True, jade maidens hold the towels, golden youths waft incense, burning the hundred harmonies’ blended fragrance to suffuse the Purple Court. They exhale the essence of the sun to dispel defilement and scatter the radiance of the moon to sweep away dust. Divine lamps shine brightly, their flames merging in luminous unity; golden winds disperse in eight directions, and auspicious clouds spread in four quarters. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the jade gates. The perfected beings of the ten directions, the great sages of the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds who have attained the Dao, and the spontaneously wondrous and practiced perfected ones—all circumambulate the Upper Palace thrice daily, bowing in reverence, soaring through the void, scattering flowers, burning incense, holding the Ten Absolutes, whistling and chanting the cavernous scriptures. They praise the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens and honor the wondrous weight of the Mysterious Writ. Thus, when Daoists perform the fast and circumambulate the high seat, chanting and pacing the void, they emulate the ancient root of the Mysterious, the assembly of the sagely perfected ones as they gather in the Jade Capital.\n\nWhen performing the ritual and prostrations, all must move with tranquil elegance, their steps measured and orderly, their bearing uniform in ascent and descent, without disorder. As they circumambulate and pace the void, they hold tablets before their hearts. In winter, they must not clasp their hands over their hearts; in summer, they must not wield fans. They stand upright, facing forward, gazing inward, visualizing the Most High upon the high seat, fixing their thoughts upon the Mysterious and True, unifying heart and form as cinnabar, aligning with the celestial canon. Thus shall they be marveled at by the flying immortals, serve as the model for the Three Realms, and be revered by ghosts and spirits. They must not glance left or right, nor jostle one another, nor speak, laugh, or jest, nor call out—lest they offend the numinous majesty, incur the scrutiny of the Four Controllers, and invite the Five Emperors to record their transgressions. The luminous statutes forbid such lapses; how can one not be vigilant?\n\nThe scripture states: During the fast, at dawn and dusk, thrice daily, one burns incense and repents of transgressions, listening with single-minded devotion to the wondrous and profound meanings of the scriptural Dharma. Thus, when the scriptures are recited and the Dharma expounded, it mirrors the ancient perfected ones’ teaching and transformation. The sages transmitted the scriptural teachings to the world, that the unhearing might hear and the unknowing might know. Through this Dharma bridge, they universally deliver all beings. During the ritual, one must not engage in idle chatter or discuss worldly affairs; one may only inquire of the Dharma Master regarding the scriptures’ meanings and precepts. The Dharma Master shall elucidate the true essentials, enabling inner and outer to become serene. If one reverently receives but a single sentence of the scriptures, the Registrar of Life shall extend one’s lifespan by ten years, and thereafter one shall be endowed with wisdom and clarity. If one is restless within or without and offends even a single sentence of the scriptures, the Registrar of Life shall deduct ten years, and thereafter one shall follow blind and foolish paths.\n\nThus, the perfected do not speak idly; when they speak, their words strike true, aligning with the Dharma’s discourse. It is said: “Humans can magnify the Dao; the Dao does not magnify humans.” After the precepts are expounded, the Dharma Master reappoints the ritual officers. The officers kneel to receive their tablets and commissions. The following day, during the ritual, each shall oversee their assigned duties.\n\nThe scripture states: One must elevate those of lofty virtue and profound understanding of the scriptures. Such persons are inwardly replete with virtue and power, outwardly adorned with majestic bearing. In every movement and stillness, they embody the Dharma’s model, serving as the exemplar for the Three Realms and the object of reverence for ghosts and spirits. They open the gates of prayers, summon the numinous, resolve doubts, dispel obstructions, and guide the assembly of worthies.\n\n**Director of Ceremonies**\nThe scripture states: One of keen intelligence and mastery of ritual protocols. Their duty is, during the ritual’s intervals—whether ascending or descending, eating or resting—to follow the Dharma Master’s lead, then guide the officers in bowing, yielding, and all ritual gestures, ensuring proper recitation and chanting.\n\n**Supervisor of the Fast**\nTheir duty is to oversee the assembly’s transgressions, admonish errors, uphold the statutes, and report infractions, ensuring all is just and without concealment or excess.\n\n**Attendant of the Scriptures**\nTheir duty is to serve the revered scriptures, arrange the cloths and wrappings, prepare the high seat, the lectern, and the seating for the four directions, ensuring all is clean and orderly, without negligence.\n\n**Attendant of Incense**\nTheir duty is to manage the censers, keeping the fire lit and the ashes clean. During the six periods of ritual and the three periods of recitation, all must be prepared in advance, without last-minute deficiencies.\n\n**Attendant of Lamps**\nTheir duty is, as dusk approaches the western quarter, to prepare the lamps, arranging them according to the ritual, ensuring their flames burn brightly and steadily. If wind or rain prevents the fire from standing, they shall consult the Dharma Master, and only then may the ritual be suspended. They must not neglect their duty, allowing lapses or omissions.\n\nAfter the appointments are made, the assembly circumambulates to the left, offers incense facing east, and recites the invocation before offering incense again. The officers lead the procession to the ritual space, seating themselves in order without loosening their sashes. The Dharma Master then proclaims the statutes and precepts, instructing the assembly on proper bearing. All listen in silence.\n\nWhen Daoists enter the fast, each must bring their own towel, robe, tablet, and footwear. They must not exchange items at the last moment, nor borrow another’s attire, lest the ritual be disrupted. On the day of the fast, when burning incense or during the recitation, the Director of Ceremonies shall lead the officers to descend first from their seats, standing to the west. The Dharma Master then descends, leading the assembly in order of rank, proceeding with measured and elegant steps to the ritual gate. They must not overtake one another, nor vary in pace, lest they incur penalties for infractions.\n\nAfter the incense is burned and the recitation concludes, the Director of Ceremonies leads the officers out of the ritual gate, all standing to the west. The Dharma Master then ascends to the high seat, and all officers bow once in unison before taking their seats. When Daoists enter or leave the fast, they must report to the Supervisor of the Fast, bow once to the Dharma Master, then bow thrice to the incense before departing. The same applies upon their return. Violations are penalized as follows:\n\n- Arriving at the ritual hall with disheveled footwear: two *sheng* of oil.\n- Rising or sitting without order: half a *liang* of cinnabar.\n- Sitting improperly: two *jin* of incense.\n- Disturbing the incense or fire: half a *jin* of incense.\n\nSpeaking to outsiders during ritual proceedings: one *jin* of incense.\nServing the scriptures with disheveled attire or disturbing objects near the high seat: half a *jin* of incense.\nMentioning worldly affairs: two *sheng* of oil.\nEngaging in frivolous speech or laughter: one *liang* of cinnabar.\nLeaning while speaking or dozing off: half a *liang* of cinnabar.\nSpilling lamp oil: five *sheng* of oil.\nWearing headscarves or robes improperly: half a *jin* of incense.\nFailing to maintain mutual discipline, speaking in loud or harsh tones: five *sheng* of oil.\nListening to scriptures while leaning or without holding a tablet: one *sheng* of oil.\nLacking focused attention, allowing the mind to wander or grow weary, noticed by others: two *sheng* of oil.\nLeaving the fast hall without reporting: two *sheng* of oil.\nLoose hair or hurried steps: one *jin* of incense.\nReciting scriptures carelessly, mispronouncing or omitting passages: five *sheng* of oil.\nChanting out of unison: two *sheng* of oil.\nPerforming incense rites without washing hands or rinsing the mouth: two *sheng* of oil.\nFailing to observe proper etiquette in rising, sitting, or bowing: half a *jin* of incense.\nCirculating out of order: half a *jin* of incense.\nAllowing incense smoke to extinguish while tending it: four *sheng* of oil.\nThe Chief Reciter failing to chant or praise with care: one *jin* of incense.\nRising, moving, or returning to one’s seat without bowing thrice to the scriptures before departing: one *jin* of incense.\nAllowing the lamp to extinguish while tending it: one *jin* of incense.\nRushing forward abruptly while burning incense: one *sheng* of oil.\nThe fast’s host failing to prepare offerings or supplies, causing deficiencies: one *jin* of incense.\nThe Enforcer observing infractions but concealing them out of favoritism: six *sheng* of oil.\nReceiving reports but failing to present them to superiors: three *sheng* of oil.\nLeaving the fast to attend to personal matters and failing to return, being reported by others: one *dou* of oil and one *jin* of incense.\nEngaging in frivolous or vulgar speech: one *jin* of incense, five *sheng* of oil, and three *liang* of cinnabar.\n\nThe *Golden Register* states: Ascending or descending the fast’s high seat with deficiencies in ritual proceedings—from the first to the third offense, the Supervisor of the Fast shall impose penalties accordingly. For infractions beyond the third, the offender shall be stripped of their rank, their misdeeds announced to their peers, and they shall be barred from the ritual seat. If the Supervisor of the Fast fails to enforce these rules, they shall incur the same penalties as the offender. Should the presiding Dharma Master commit ritual deficiencies, their faults shall be recorded and reported to the Supervisor of the Fast. For the first to third offenses, they shall be barred from the ritual seat for three hundred days. The *Regulations on Dignity* state: Penalty items shall be given to the fast’s host, announced to the assembly, and then used for public purposes.\n\nAll these prohibitions derive from the ancient statutes of the Supreme Bureau of the Mysterious Capital, serving to curb negligence and enforce discipline. The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, pities those who undertake the fast yet incur transgressions. Thus, these penalty provisions allow offenders to redeem themselves with offerings of incense and oil, dispersing their misfortunes and averting karmic retribution, lest their sins accrue in the unseen realm. Moreover, these measures instill remorse in the transgressor, prompting reform and renewal. Though the required offerings of incense and oil may seem modest, they are often difficult to procure at short notice. Furthermore, Daoist fasts are frequently attended by transient participants; once the ritual concludes, they disperse, making it impossible to collect penalties, thereby violating scriptural intent and compounding their offenses.\n\nEven those guilty of grave transgressions may, through fasting and redemption, dissolve their karmic debts. How much more should those who uphold the precepts strive to observe proper decorum? If ritual infractions are to be penalized with prostrations, this too may be permissible. The number of prostrations shall correspond to the severity of the offense, to be determined by the officiating officers and respectfully reported to the fast’s host.\n\nThe fast’s rites are most refined, its prohibitions most stringent. This is because the Perfected of Heaven, the Great Spirits, the sages of the ten directions, and the myriad spirits of the three realms all descend to witness the ritual. Demon kings bow in reverence, and local deities stand guard at the gates. The host must sweep and purify the premises, ensuring cleanliness. They shall instruct all, great and small, to maintain silence within and without, marking the gates to bar entry and preventing interference from outsiders or the uninitiated. If devout men and women, drawn to the Dao, arrive in proper attire to observe, they shall be seated separately and not intermingled. All participants, from the host to the youngest, shall wear sashes and proper footwear, never slovenly or barefoot. When giving instructions, they shall speak softly and gently, never shouting or calling out. Harsh voices disturb the Perfected and violate divine prohibitions.\n\nIf guests or the host are in mourning, even if they have not met, they shall maintain composure and avoid condolences or displays of grief. If a guest of low status attends a host of high rank, their disparity in worldly standing may hinder mutual understanding. Though they may revere the Dao, they may fail to show proper respect to the Daoists. Yet the Dao is supreme, its virtue unmatched; though a Daoist may be humble, their aspirations are lofty. The host, seeking hidden blessings, should humble themselves, bowing in sincerity, for only through self-effacement can virtue flow and blessings converge. They must not remain aloof or arrogant, for disdaining the Daoists severs the flow of subtle grace and divine favor.\n\nHeaven’s rain falls evenly, yet mountain peaks remain dry, for their towering heights leave no room to receive it. The Eastern Sea reigns over all rivers not by force or coercion, but by its nature—vast and lowly, it embraces all impurities, drawing the convergence of countless streams. If young children are unfit to observe the fast, they must not be allowed near the ritual hall or disrupt the proceedings.\n\nThe essence of the fast lies in purity and emptiness, its practice in tranquility, its foundation in humility, and its duty in reverence.\n\nEver trembling, ever vigilant, as though treading upon ice or crossing a ravine; solemn and reverent, as though standing before a stern lord. At every sacred phrase, rise to perform the ritual bow; with wholehearted devotion, voice your praises, and follow your intentions in prayer—only through sincere supplication will there be response. The Most High’s Dao-eye ever pierces through, observing all good and evil beneath the heavens, leaving nothing, not even the slightest, unnoticed.\n\nHere concludes the *Ritual of the Radiant Candle of Precepts and Penalties from the Luminous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery’s Fast-Sayings*.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Dongxuan Lingbao Rites of Candlelight, Precepts, Penance, Lamps, and Vows***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Dongxuan Lingbao Exposition on the Rites of Candlelight, Precepts, Penance, Lamps, and Vows*\nComposed by Daoist Lu Xiujing of the Liu-Song dynasty. An essential treatise on the precepts and rituals of Lingbao fasts. One fascicle.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* section, *Weiyi* (Ritual Propriety) category.\n\n---\n\n### *Exposition on the Candlelight Fast (External Discourse)*\n**By Lu Xiujing**\n\nBefore assembling for the fast, one should retire to a private chamber, burn incense, and gird oneself to expound the rites.\n\n\"Candlelight\" (*juéguāng*) is akin to what Zhuangzi called a \"torch flame\"—a faint glimmer. The Dao of fasting is supremely refined, yet practitioners often remain coarse, for the five turbidities and defilements obscure and obstruct. Like dwelling in a dark cavern untouched by the sun, one must rely on the illumination of lamps and candles. This is the meaning of \"candlelight.\"\n\nHere, the great principles of fasting scriptures are outlined, and the essentials of the ritual body are presented concisely. The intent is to restrain the crude and vulgar, guiding them toward profound clarity. It is like a carpenter selecting wood: if a piece is warped, one must first trim its excess before applying the inked line. Alas, my own clumsiness has led to such prolixity—perhaps the grain of the wood is too gnarled for the master’s craft.\n\nWhen preparing for a fast or offering, one should first expound the rites in a private chamber, girding oneself and kindling incense according to the proper method.\n\nIn fasting, one must sit in silent reverence within a secluded chamber, mastering the passions and sealing the gates of the spirit to bar external distractions. Uphold the Ten Precepts to prevent worldly thoughts from arising. Cultivate a courageous and resolute heart, practicing the Ten Daoist Practices. Strengthen and stabilize the will so that it cannot be swayed. Immerse oneself in the profound and savor the true, ensuring every thought is pure—this is the essence of fasting.\n\n1. **Purify with fragrant water**, cleansing the five limbs with spirit and qi, making the nine orifices bright and clear. Clothe oneself in immaculate garments, both inner and outer, suffused with fragrance. Thus may the lofty perfected and the numinous void descend and draw near.\n\n2. **Abandon worldly affairs**, severing mundane entanglements. Withdraw from all distractions, both internal and external, embracing serene non-action. Body and mind at ease, focus the thoughts with single-minded devotion.\n\n3. **Moderate one’s diet**, curbing desires and cutting away excess. Balance hunger and satiety, harmonizing the viscera. Thus may the spirit and qi remain clear and tranquil, nurturing the primordial spring.\n\n4. **Maintain dignified bearing and proper attire**, conducting oneself with solemnity and reverence. Forsake arrogance and sloth, never neglecting diligence. In prostrations and supplications, fulfill each act with utmost devotion.\n\n5. **Seal the mouth and still the tongue**, refraining from idle speech. Regulate the voice and rectify the qi, reciting and chanting scriptures. Thus may one enlighten humans and spirits, resonating with immortals and sages.\n\n6. **Purify the heart and mind**, banishing wayward thoughts. Subdue the six senses and eradicate the Three Poisons. Concentrate the spirit on the true, penetrating the subtle and obscure.\n\n7. **Burn incense and waft its smoke**, sounding the drum to summon the gods. Thus may the Three Clarities hear above, and the Ten Directions be universally proclaimed.\n\n8. **Confess and repent transgressions**, beseeching and making vows. With a heart as sincere as cinnabar, humble and earnest, pour forth one’s pleas.\n\n9. **Cultivate great compassion**, pitying all beings beset by calamities, afflictions, and suffering. Vow to deliver them all, that in life and death they may know peace, free from sorrow.\n\n10. **In movement and stillness**, maintain grace and refinement. Guide one another with words, confining speech to the Dao, never straying from the Dharma. If one perceives a misstep or error, immediately correct it, prostrating to repent.\n\nThis is the *Lingbao Natural and Supreme Fast*.\n\n\"Ling\" means \"numinous.\" Its wondrous efficacy transcends thought and discourse, its transformations boundless—hence it is called \"ling.\"\n\n\"Bao\" means \"oneness.\" It is what the Three Powers attain, embodying purity, tranquility, and integrity. As it cannot be lost, it is called \"bao.\" Cling to it without parting, and myriad blessings will naturally converge. Deviate from it even for a moment, and misfortunes and chaos will swiftly gather. Fortune and misfortune, benefit and harm, gain and loss—none can compel their arising, nor prevent their absence. Thus it is called \"natural.\"\n\nIt universally aids the Five Paths, delivering all beings, extinguishing the cycle of birth and death, and transcending the Three Realms—hence it is called \"supreme.\"\n\nThough mortals are not perfected beings, they dwell amidst the Five Turbidities, where the Three Corpses thrive, inwardly generating assailants. The nine orifices and four gates each pursue their own inclinations, and every action leads toward death, cutting short one’s heavenly years. Failing to fulfill one’s allotted lifespan, one commits evil and transgresses, accruing sins in the hidden courts. Thus, in this world, one suffers hardship, never escaping the cycle of human existence—plagued by hunger, cold, poverty, and lowliness, afflicted by illness, punishment, and calamity, enmeshed in misfortune. Only after death does one tread the path of suffering.\n\nFor this reason, the Most High Heavenly Worthy opened the Purple Tenuity Jade Tablets of the Upper Palace of the Mystery Capital and revealed the *Lingbao Wondrous Fasts*. As the three gates of humans are restless and unruly, prone to killing, theft, and lust, they are disciplined through prostrations. As the mouth utters evil words, frivolous speech, and double-tongued deceit, it is tasked with scripture recitation. As the heart harbors thoughts of greed, desire, anger, and resentment, it is directed to contemplate the spirit. Through these three methods, the heart is cleansed and conduct purified. When heart and conduct reach utmost refinement, this is the meaning of fasting.\n\nExtend benevolent vows and virtuous thoughts to amplify merit and karma. The resolve to uphold precepts must be like grasping a rope while falling into a well—never relinquished for even a moment. The commitment to the Dharma must be like reinforcing a crumbling dam—never allowing indolence. The devotion to practice must be like tending fertile fields—never wearying of cultivation. Day and night, uphold the precepts and revere the Dharma with tireless diligence. Thus may one resonate with the Great Mystery, drawing the descent of true numina. The Three Corpses will be expelled, and all demons subdued. With such vows, nothing will go unfulfilled; no aspiration will remain unachieved.\n\nThe age of sagely rule is rare to encounter, the scriptures and Dharma rare to hear, opportune moments rare to meet, and enlightened teachers rare to find. All you worthy ones, in past lives, possessed great fortune, bringing this auspicious convergence in your present existence. You have encountered the Three Treasures, heard the Dharma’s teachings, and embraced the pure and void. You have feasted on the numinous essence, your names already inscribed in the imperial registers of the Mystery Capital, recorded in golden script and jade tablets. You are the honored guests of the Heavenly Palace, the immortal companions of the Most High.",

      "translated_text": "Now you have ascended to the Dharma-seat, embraced the Dharma’s discipline, and made a virtuous beginning—why not bring it to fulfillment? Let us together steel our resolve, contend with indolence, uphold the Dharma’s teachings, and regard mindfulness as sublime practice. Exert yourselves with sincerity, heedless of weariness; a single day’s diligence will bring blessings across lifetimes.\n\nHuman life is perilous, the four elements unreliable; a century passes in an instant—how can it be considered long? When decrepitude suddenly arrives, eyes dim and ears grow deaf, afflictions multiply, and pain and distress entwine you, then even rising, sitting, breathing, or moving will require another’s strength. In such a state, will you still be able to advance in the Dao’s work, to partake in this Dharma-seat?\n\nTo lose this auspicious opportunity—when will the next arise? To sink into the depths of suffering—what use is regret? Reflect on these words, each for your own sake, and encourage one another to cross the perilous straits together.\n\nIf one’s past lives bear heavy sins and karmic adversaries, they will be enshrouded in obscuring veils, the six obstructions unopened, the mind narrow and perverse, the qi and nature contrary and rebellious. Deluded by the five desires, they see nothing beyond, indulging in rich flavors, sounds, and sights for fleeting pleasure. They detest goodness and envy the worthy, treating them like foes.\n\nSuch people, wherever they turn, are drawn to evil, forever estranged from the scriptures and teachings. Even if they encounter them, they do not believe. Seeing others revere and follow the Dao and Dharma, they call it delusion and join in mockery. The deaf do not hear the *Shao* and *Wu* melodies; the blind do not see white from black—can one say they are not afflicted?\n\nEven if some good understanding forcibly pulls them, it is not their true nature, and regret soon arises. They turn from truth toward falsehood, chasing after perverse spirits. Fleeting joy passes, while suffering lingers. These beings take the three wretched destinies as their path, the earthly prisons as their home. Forever lost in darkest night, they never behold the three luminaries. They embrace copper pillars, tread upon knife mountains, follow sword trees, plunge into cauldrons of boiling water, swallow fire and devour coals—through kalpas unending, no escape.\n\nEven if they are reborn, they fall into the forms of the six livestock, their bodies subjected to the cruelty of slaughter, their souls tormented in the three evil realms.

      "translated_text": "At the onset of establishing the fast, one begins by burning incense and lodging the evening petition, yet without contemplating before the deities, one faces east and declares it. *Dharma Torch*.\n\n\"Dharma\" denotes the compass and square, collectively termed \"Dharma.\" The compass draws the circle, the square carves the right angle—all things conform to them and thus attain correctness. \"Torch\" is an object of illumination, aiding the moon and supplementing the sun, dispelling dusk and brightening darkness. By its light, one gains sight.\n\nCrookedness and perversion lack Dharma and thus have no means to rectify themselves; applying Dharma without illumination yields no perception of gain or loss. To rectify, one cannot be without Dharma; to apply Dharma, one cannot be without light. To settle oneself, one cannot forgo the fast; the fast cannot proceed without this text. This text serves as the *Dharma Torch*, guiding one through the Daoist canon to attain the true treasure.\n\nOf all things, humans are most noble; of humans, life is most precious. Life depends upon the spirit and qi. Spirit and qi within the human body govern the vitality of the four limbs. One cannot be without qi even for a moment, nor lose spirit in bowing or raising the head. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to collapse; losing qi brings sudden death. Qi and spirit ever accompany each other. Spirit and qi ever rely upon one another for strength. When spirit departs, qi perishes; when qi is severed, the body is lost.\n\nAll fear death and delight in life, yet do not know that the work of living lies in spirit and qi. Instead, they repeatedly agitate their minds, offend their qi, indulge their spirits, and wither their lives. They do not cherish stillness or preserve their true nature, thus bringing about their own ruin. How can one not treasure essence and guard qi to seek long-lasting vision, harmoniously nurturing all things to cultivate the blessings of branches and leaves?\n\nThe sage, seeing the people rushing headlong into the five desires and unable to settle themselves, established the fast as a method. Through affairs, one ceases affairs; through precepts, one restrains inner bandits; through威仪, one guards against external thieves. Ritual recitation engages body and speech, riding movement to return to stillness. Meditating on the spirit engages the mind, guiding existence to revert to emptiness. When stillness and emptiness are achieved, the Dao is harmonized. It is like reining in the hooves of a swift steed to align the chariot returning to truth.\n\nYan Zun said: \"Empty the mind to trace the origin of the Dao; still the qi to await the divine spirit.\" This is the meaning.\n\nYet scholars of the degenerate age value ornament and despise substance. Blessings lie in stillness, yet they seek them in motion; life rests within, yet they abandon themselves to external things. Such people, though eager to practice the fast, do not understand its methods. Or, understanding its methods, they do not recognize its form. Or, recognizing its form, they do not grasp its meaning. Or, grasping its meaning, they do not attain its intent. Confused and disordered, they act without restraint, drifting astray and losing their foundation, never awakening to themselves. It is like turning one’s back to a fierce wind and following a swift current, unaware of rowing back to the source, thus forever drowning in the sea of suffering—how lamentable!\n\nI have carefully gathered from the various scriptures and compiled them into ten chapters, to be applied during the fast, naming it *Dharma Torch*. The evening petition comprises one chapter; the six periods of ritual conduct, six chapters; the three periods of spirit meditation, three chapters. If the Dharma Master illuminates these to practice the fast, and all officials and hosts can empty their minds to receive them, then their sight and hearing will be clear, and they may glimpse the gate of the Great Dao.\n\nThe Dao is the name for the ultimate principle. Virtue is acting in accordance with principle. The scriptures are the paths of passage. The Dao is like a road; virtue, like good virtue; the scriptures, like measured paths; conduct, like walking; Dharma, like a model. Those who study the Dao must rely on Dharma to seek the scriptures, practice goodness to perfect virtue, and thus attain the Dao. Without performing meritorious deeds, merely guarding the One without wavering, one will never achieve the Dao. It is like a person sitting at home and not walking—how can they see the road?\n\nThe Dao, combined with three, completes virtue. Without fulfilling the three, nothing is accomplished. The three are: Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Benevolence is one. Performing meritorious deeds is two. Virtue sufficient to complete the Dao is three. When these three unite, one attains the Dao. If one merely performs meritorious deeds but does not understand the Dao, one does not attain the Dao. If one merely understands the Dao but lacks meritorious deeds, one does not attain the Dao. If one possesses Dao and virtue but lacks benevolence, the ultimate principle is obscured and returns to nothingness. It is like sowing grain, casting seed into the earth without water to moisten it—how can it grow? There is a ruler and ministers but no people—how can they govern? There is heaven and earth but no beings—how can they nurture?

      "translated_text": "Let those living behold the Dao, their bodies freed from the eight difficulties; let the deceased rejoice, feasting in celestial halls, soon reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. Those who perform purification rites and seek the Dao must single-mindedly request and uphold the Ten Precepts, receiving them with clarity and never forgetting. Focus the mind in silent contemplation, penetrating the natural with profound reflection. Let no stray thoughts disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall listen in stillness.\n\nThe First Precept: Let the heart harbor no malice or jealousy, giving no rise to the thieves of yin. Guard the mouth and be cautious of transgressions, with thoughts ever fixed upon the Dharma.\n\nThe Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing, showing compassion and aiding all beings. Embrace kindness and extend salvation, nourishing all things.\n\nThe Third Precept: Maintain chastity and yield with righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Always act with good intentions, diminishing the self to aid others.\n\nThe Fourth Precept: Be free from lust and desire, the heart untouched by wantonness. Preserve purity and caution, with conduct unstained.\n\nThe Fifth Precept: Let the mouth utter no evil words, nor speech be ornate or deceitful. Be upright within and without, committing no transgressions of speech.\n\nThe Sixth Precept: Abstain from wine and moderate conduct, harmonizing qi and temperament. Let the spirit remain unharmed, avoiding all evils.\n\nThe Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you, nor contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, humbling yourself to deliver others.\n\nThe Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings, nor slander sacred texts. Receive the Dharma with reverence, ever as though in the presence of the divine.\n\nThe Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor men bear resentment, nor harm spirit and qi.\n\nThe Tenth Precept: In all actions and deeds, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people and gods, with conduct ever thus.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: Those who cultivate and uphold the pure precepts ever align with the heart of Heaven. Always practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from this world of suffering. Be humble and reverent in following the teachings, never slackening midway. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Thus unwavering, one may escape the five destinies and avoid the three evils. Protected by all heavens and revered by the myriad spirits, those who maintain the fast and uphold the precepts shall naturally attain deliverance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: The Dao is revered, the Dharma wondrous, and the human body likewise precious. Thus the Dao reveals the Dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver humanity. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to unite with the Dao. One should practice with diligence, observe the fast, and uphold the precepts. Calm the mind and still the thoughts, with aspirations clear and intent focused. Direct the will single-mindedly, without distraction. Purify the six viscera, abstaining from flavors beyond the mean. Be empty and pure within and without, ever in accord with the natural. On the day of the fast, hold incense and make vows, allowing the heart’s sincerity to ascend. The patrolling deities of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions shall descend to witness and listen to the Dharma sound, overseeing and reflecting upon your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao shall have their merits recorded in the heavens. Retribution for blessings and misfortunes shall be swiftly manifest. The Dao does not fail those who practice with diligence; receive the teachings earnestly and let no demonic words deceive.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: When establishing purification rites and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings shall arrive in flying clouds, riding eight-jade-carriaged green chariots, accompanied by perfected beings and jade maidens. They bear flower banners, leading with phoenix songs, followed by celestial music. White cranes and lions chant in harmony, burning incense and scattering flowers as they float through the air. They gaze upon those practicing the Dao, listening to the Dharma sound. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How can one not fully adhere to this method? First receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Move with refined and graceful steps, the mind serene and the intent composed. In sitting, rising, lying, and resting, never depart from proper decorum. The Heavenly Kings shall rejoice, and your name shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. This is truly attaining the Dao within the square inch of the heart.\n\nThe scripture states: To move Heaven and Earth, summon the host of spirits, commune with the immortal Dao, penetrate the utmost truth, dissolve accumulated sins of past lives, eradicate misfortune, repel vengeful foes, cultivate great virtue, heal illnesses, and deliver all beings—nothing surpasses the practice of purification rites and the recitation of scriptures. The fast is indeed the foundation of seeking the Dao; all accomplishments stem from it. Its merit is towering, beyond compare. Above, it enables ascension to immortality and attainment of the Dao; in the middle, it brings peace to the nation and the household, prolongs life, and secures blessings and prosperity, attaining the Dao of non-action. Below, it eliminates past transgressions, pardons present faults, rescues from distress, eases difficulties, dispels disasters and illnesses, liberates the deceased from suffering, and delivers all beings—nothing is inapt.\n\nThe scripture states: Among the great methods of purification rites, none surpasses the *Lingbao* Fast of the Most High. The *Lingbao* scriptures are the primordial root of Heaven and Earth, the gateway and window of the divine luminaries, the ancestor of all scriptures, and the bridge of boundless great Dharma. If one recites but a single sentence, its resonance shall pierce the nine heavens, and all gods shall pay homage while ghosts and spirits stand in awe. Its profundity and wonder are beyond declaration. None but the utmost good in the world can achieve it; none but the utmost faith can request it; none but the utmost sincerity can uphold it; none but the utmost talent can practice it.",

      "translated_text": "The Most High holds it in the highest regard, and all perfected beings revere it—cast in golden characters, inscribed upon jade tablets, and sealed within the Supreme Great Luoxia Heaven, upon the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis, in the Purple Tenuity Palace’s Seven Treasures Mystic Terrace. This terrace is where the Most High presides. The Five Elders stand in attendance, the Ten Thousand Emperors pay homage to the True, jade maidens hold the towels, golden youths waft incense, burning the hundred harmonies’ blended fragrance to suffuse the Purple Court. They exhale the essence of the sun to dispel defilement and scatter the radiance of the moon to sweep away dust. Divine lamps shine brightly, their flames merging in luminous unity; golden winds disperse in eight directions, and auspicious clouds spread in four quarters. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the jade gates. The perfected beings of the ten directions, the great sages of the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds who have attained the Dao, and the spontaneously wondrous and practiced perfected ones—all circumambulate the Upper Palace thrice daily, bowing in reverence, soaring through the void, scattering flowers, burning incense, holding the Ten Absolutes, whistling and chanting the cavernous scriptures. They praise the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens and honor the wondrous weight of the Mysterious Writ. Thus, when Daoists perform the fast and circumambulate the high seat, chanting and pacing the void, they emulate the ancient root of the Mysterious, the assembly of the sagely perfected ones as they gather in the Jade Capital.\n\nWhen performing the ritual and prostrations, all must move with tranquil elegance, their steps measured and orderly, their bearing uniform in ascent and descent, without disorder. As they circumambulate and pace the void, they hold tablets before their hearts. In winter, they must not clasp their hands over their hearts; in summer, they must not wield fans. They stand upright, facing forward, gazing inward, visualizing the Most High upon the high seat, fixing their thoughts upon the Mysterious and True, unifying heart and form as cinnabar, aligning with the celestial canon. Thus shall they be marveled at by the flying immortals, serve as the model for the Three Realms, and be revered by ghosts and spirits. They must not glance left or right, nor jostle one another, nor speak, laugh, or jest, nor call out—lest they offend the numinous majesty, incur the scrutiny of the Four Controllers, and invite the Five Emperors to record their transgressions. The luminous statutes forbid such lapses; how can one not be vigilant?\n\nThe scripture states: During the fast, at dawn and dusk, thrice daily, one burns incense and repents of transgressions, listening with single-minded devotion to the wondrous and profound meanings of the scriptural Dharma. Thus, when the scriptures are recited and the Dharma expounded, it mirrors the ancient perfected ones’ teaching and transformation. The sages transmitted the scriptural teachings to the world, that the unhearing might hear and the unknowing might know. Through this Dharma bridge, they universally deliver all beings. During the ritual, one must not engage in idle chatter or discuss worldly affairs; one may only inquire of the Dharma Master regarding the scriptures’ meanings and precepts. The Dharma Master shall elucidate the true essentials, enabling inner and outer to become serene. If one reverently receives but a single sentence of the scriptures, the Registrar of Life shall extend one’s lifespan by ten years, and thereafter one shall be endowed with wisdom and clarity. If one is restless within or without and offends even a single sentence of the scriptures, the Registrar of Life shall deduct ten years, and thereafter one shall follow blind and foolish paths.\n\nThus, the perfected do not speak idly; when they speak, their words strike true, aligning with the Dharma’s discourse. It is said: “Humans can magnify the Dao; the Dao does not magnify humans.” After the precepts are expounded, the Dharma Master reappoints the ritual officers. The officers kneel to receive their tablets and commissions. The following day, during the ritual, each shall oversee their assigned duties.\n\nThe scripture states: One must elevate those of lofty virtue and profound understanding of the scriptures. Such persons are inwardly replete with virtue and power, outwardly adorned with majestic bearing. In every movement and stillness, they embody the Dharma’s model, serving as the exemplar for the Three Realms and the object of reverence for ghosts and spirits. They open the gates of prayers, summon the numinous, resolve doubts, dispel obstructions, and guide the assembly of worthies.\n\n**Director of Ceremonies**\nThe scripture states: One of keen intelligence and mastery of ritual protocols. Their duty is, during the ritual’s intervals—whether ascending or descending, eating or resting—to follow the Dharma Master’s lead, then guide the officers in bowing, yielding, and all ritual gestures, ensuring proper recitation and chanting.\n\n**Supervisor of the Fast**\nTheir duty is to oversee the assembly’s transgressions, admonish errors, uphold the statutes, and report infractions, ensuring all is just and without concealment or excess.\n\n**Attendant of the Scriptures**\nTheir duty is to serve the revered scriptures, arrange the cloths and wrappings, prepare the high seat, the lectern, and the seating for the four directions, ensuring all is clean and orderly, without negligence.\n\n**Attendant of Incense**\nTheir duty is to manage the censers, keeping the fire lit and the ashes clean. During the six periods of ritual and the three periods of recitation, all must be prepared in advance, without last-minute deficiencies.\n\n**Attendant of Lamps**\nTheir duty is, as dusk approaches the western quarter, to prepare the lamps, arranging them according to the ritual, ensuring their flames burn brightly and steadily. If wind or rain prevents the fire from standing, they shall consult the Dharma Master, and only then may the ritual be suspended. They must not neglect their duty, allowing lapses or omissions.\n\nAfter the appointments are made, the assembly circumambulates to the left, offers incense facing east, and recites the invocation before offering incense again. The officers lead the procession to the ritual space, seating themselves in order without loosening their sashes. The Dharma Master then proclaims the statutes and precepts, instructing the assembly on proper bearing. All listen in silence.\n\nWhen Daoists enter the fast, each must bring their own towel, robe, tablet, and footwear. They must not exchange items at the last moment, nor borrow another’s attire, lest the ritual be disrupted. On the day of the fast, when burning incense or during the recitation, the Director of Ceremonies shall lead the officers to descend first from their seats, standing to the west. The Dharma Master then descends, leading the assembly in order of rank, proceeding with measured and elegant steps to the ritual gate. They must not overtake one another, nor vary in pace, lest they incur penalties for infractions.\n\nAfter the incense is burned and the recitation concludes, the Director of Ceremonies leads the officers out of the ritual gate, all standing to the west. The Dharma Master then ascends to the high seat, and all officers bow once in unison before taking their seats. When Daoists enter or leave the fast, they must report to the Supervisor of the Fast, bow once to the Dharma Master, then bow thrice to the incense before departing. The same applies upon their return. Violations are penalized as follows:\n\n- Arriving at the ritual hall with disheveled footwear: two *sheng* of oil.\n- Rising or sitting without order: half a *liang* of cinnabar.\n- Sitting improperly: two *jin* of incense.\n- Disturbing the incense or fire: half a *jin* of incense.",

For infractions beyond the third, the offender shall be stripped of their rank, their misdeeds announced to their peers, and they shall be barred from the ritual seat. If the Supervisor of the Fast fails to enforce these rules, they shall incur the same penalties as the offender. Should the presiding Dharma Master commit ritual deficiencies, their faults shall be recorded and reported to the Supervisor of the Fast. For the first to third offenses, they shall be barred from the ritual seat for three hundred days. The *Regulations on Dignity* state: Penalty items shall be given to the fast’s host, announced to the assembly, and then used for public purposes.\n\nAll these prohibitions derive from the ancient statutes of the Supreme Bureau of the Mysterious Capital, serving to curb negligence and enforce discipline. The Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, pities those who undertake the fast yet incur transgressions. Thus, these penalty provisions allow offenders to redeem themselves with offerings of incense and oil, dispersing their misfortunes and averting karmic retribution, lest their sins accrue in the unseen realm. Moreover, these measures instill remorse in the transgressor, prompting reform and renewal. Though the required offerings of incense and oil may seem modest, they are often difficult to procure at short notice. Furthermore, Daoist fasts are frequently attended by transient participants; once the ritual concludes, they disperse, making it impossible to collect penalties, thereby violating scriptural intent and compounding their offenses.\n\nEven those guilty of grave transgressions may, through fasting and redemption, dissolve their karmic debts. How much more should those who uphold the precepts strive to observe proper decorum? If ritual infractions are to be penalized with prostrations, this too may be permissible. The number of prostrations shall correspond to the severity of the offense, to be determined by the officiating officers and respectfully reported to the fast’s host.\n\nThe fast’s rites are most refined, its prohibitions most stringent. This is because the Perfected of Heaven, the Great Spirits, the sages of the ten directions, and the myriad spirits of the three realms all descend to witness the ritual. Demon kings bow in reverence, and local deities stand guard at the gates. The host must sweep and purify the premises, ensuring cleanliness. They shall instruct all, great and small, to maintain silence within and without, marking the gates to bar entry and preventing interference from outsiders or the uninitiated. If devout men and women, drawn to the Dao, arrive in proper attire to observe, they shall be seated separately and not intermingled. All participants, from the host to the youngest, shall wear sashes and proper footwear, never slovenly or barefoot. When giving instructions, they shall speak softly and gently, never shouting or calling out. Harsh voices disturb the Perfected and violate divine prohibitions.\n\nIf guests or the host are in mourning, even if they have not met, they shall maintain composure and avoid condolences or displays of grief. If a guest of low status attends a host of high rank, their disparity in worldly standing may hinder mutual understanding. Though they may revere the Dao, they may fail to show proper respect to the Daoists. Yet the Dao is supreme, its virtue unmatched; though a Daoist may be humble, their aspirations are lofty. The host, seeking hidden blessings, should humble themselves, bowing in sincerity, for only through self-effacement can virtue flow and blessings converge. They must not remain aloof or arrogant, for disdaining the Daoists severs the flow of subtle grace and divine favor.\n\nHeaven’s rain falls evenly, yet mountain peaks remain dry, for their towering heights leave no room to receive it. The Eastern Sea reigns over all rivers not by force or coercion, but by its nature—vast and lowly, it embraces all impurities, drawing the convergence of countless streams. If young children are unfit to observe the fast, they must not be allowed near the ritual hall or disrupt the proceedings.\n\nThe essence of the fast lies in purity and emptiness, its practice in tranquility, its foundation in humility, and its duty in reverence.",

When Daoists enter or leave the fast, they must report to the Supervisor of the Fast, bow once to the Dharma Master, then bow thrice to the incense before departing.
