  "full_translation": "The *Marvelous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Demons, Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Marvelous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Demons, Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*\n**Original Attribution:** Transmitted to Ouyang Wen by the Celestial Clerk of the Azure Sky Grotto, Hua Taiyi of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity’s Scriptures and Registers.\n**Internal References:** As recounted by Perfected Lord Tao and Zheng Siyuan, likely composed between the late Tang and early Song dynasties.\n**Ten fascicles.**\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n**The Marvelous Scripture of the Divine Incantations of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Demons, Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Fascicle the First**\nTransmitted to Ouyang Wen by the Celestial Clerk of the Azure Sky Grotto, Hua Taiyi of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity’s Scriptures and Registers\n\n**Chapter on the Preface and Discourse**\n\nThe Dao speaks:\nIn the first year of the Dragon-Han era, the *jiawu* year, the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided in the Palace of the Upper Primordial, the Celestial Capital of the Eight Effulgences. Seated upon a precious throne of fivefold clouds, he let fall the ten mystic banners of absolute numinosity. Accompanied by the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected Ones of the Ten Poles, jade lads and jade maidens, the Venerable Ones of the Three Luminaries, the demon-subduing Great Kings of Majestic Power, the Great Spirits of the Eight Effulgences, and an innumerable host of flying dragon riders and celestial clerks, the azure vault resounded with celestial hymns, and the music of the heavens swayed and drifted as he expounded the wondrous Dharma of the True Unity.\n\nAt that time, the northeastern quarter of the Celestial Capital of the Upper Primordial trembled and quaked. Suddenly, the gates of heaven swung open, and gazing downward, a dense and surging crimson radiance was seen, intermingled with turbid qi. Dark and obscure, it rose from the northeastern realm of the human world, piercing the celestial palaces. Coiling and congealing, it refused to disperse, its vapors reeking of blood and putrid filth.\n\nThe assembled multitude was struck with awe and dared not speak. Then, from within the Dharma assembly, a Perfected One named Wondrous Conduct, replete with blessings and virtue, raised his gaze, adjusted his robes, and stepped forward. Drawing in his tablets and pacing with measured steps, he prostrated himself twice, kneeling in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\n\n“Your servant has heard that the realm of the utmost Perfected and wondrous is luminous and free of inauspicious omens, while the land of the formless by nature expels all monstrous anomalies. Though I have attended the Dao Lord for ten thousand kalpas, never before have I witnessed such a strange sight.”\n\nAlas! Today, within this Dharma assembly, we behold this foul congealing of black, poisonous, blood-laden qi surging chaotically toward the heavens. What portent of disaster or fortune is this? I implore the Most Sagely One to once more proclaim the wondrous canon, dispelling the doubts of all and tracing this phenomenon to its source, that those who cultivate the Dao may be moved to reverence and devotion.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning smiled faintly after a long silence and spoke: \"You all must know this—compose yourselves in stillness and quietude, for I shall explain it to you. The beings of the Lower Kalpa all descend from this very realm. Their forms, born of the undifferentiated True Unity, are endowed with thirty-six thousand divine qi. Yet though they are upheld and guarded in purity, they have long been swayed by yin demons, forgetting their origin and losing their root. Now that the reckoning of three nines has reached its end, ghostly demons proliferate. They cling to deviant paths, forsaking the source of the Dao. Their bodies, host to manifold spirits, are confounded by legions of yin demons and malevolent ghosts. Their hearts breed wickedness, and they slaughter the multitudes of living beings, aligning themselves with gods and ghosts to ingratiate themselves and seek spurious blessings. As the appointed cycle nears its close, they grow reckless and dissolute, disloyal and unfilial, unkind and unjust, delighting in perverse ways. Now, the Six Heavens’ ghostly spirits inflict wanton harm. Whether man or woman, old or young, they cut short lives not yet fulfilled, snuffing them out untimely. The souls of the dead, not yet dispersed, coalesce into baleful qi, their resentment and fury ascending in a surge—you ought to take heed of this.\"\n\nUpon hearing these words, Wondrous Conduct was seized with great dread. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Those ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens—what power and might do they possess? What supernatural abilities? How is it that they roam the mortal realm, inflicting all manner of harm, slaughtering and wounding living beings without fear, defying all dharmas and restraints? I beseech you, deign to elucidate this for your servant. Though I am dull-witted, I would borrow your sagely power to comprehend their origins. Then I might journey there to offer salvation, sparing the beings of the Lower Kalpa from such unjust calamities.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed Wondrous Conduct, saying: \"Beyond the due north of this celestial realm, past the boundless expanse of the Great Brine where measure fails, at the uttermost extremity of the northern quarter, there lies a world called the Cavern of Five Qi Mystic Heaven, shrouded in yin’s desolate gloom. Within that land rules an Imperial Lord named the Supreme Yin Fivefold Numinous Mystic Elder Black Thearch Numinous Lord. His attendant and chief minister is the Mystic Nourishment Heavenly Lord. The Supreme Numinous Lord, in his practice of true qi, descended to give birth to a Jade Maiden named the Supreme Mystic Night Radiance Jade Maiden. Together with the Lord and the boundless host of Mystic Numinous Officials of the northern precincts, they unseal the Northern Gate of the Supreme Mystic, called the Gate of Yin’s Vast Numinous Birth. There they expound the *Marvelous Scripture of the Supreme Mystic True Unity*, by which they govern and restrain the yin demons. All who taste this dharma’s savor—even the dead revive, withered bones grow plump again, and none suffer untimely death or unjust calamity.\n\nBeneath that land stretches the Great Void and Vast Wilderness of the Brine’s Abyss, its circumference beyond all measure. Its waters are foul, rank, and black, their depths unfathomable. At its center rises a mighty mountain, its summit piercing the azure vault, its base plunging into the windy springs, named Mount Fengdu Luo. It towers one hundred and six thousand li high, its girth fifty thousand li. Its roots descend ten thousand li into the water. At the water’s edge, where the mountain’s foot meets the deep, lies the Cavern-Heaven Realm of Yin’s Shadow. Its sovereign is the Supreme Yin Water Thearch, the Northern Yin Heavenly Lord. This cavern-heaven spans fifteen thousand li in circumference; its palace is called the Palace of Supreme Yin. His aides and ministers include: the Life-Generating Qi Lord of the Eastern Dipper, the Form-Generating Lord of the Western Dipper, the Prohibitions Overseer of the Southern Dipper, the Life Mandate Overseer of the Northern Dipper, the General Records Keeper of the Central Dipper, the Nine Commanding Subordinate Officers, the Prefects of the Five Marchmounts, the Twenty-Four Yin Officials of the Twenty-Four Governances, the Twenty-Four Yang Officials of the Twenty-Four Governances, the River and Sea Attendants, the Masters of Hills, Mounds, Streams, and Ravines, and a boundless host of lesser officers. The baleful spirits and malevolent gods of the Six Heavens serve as his guards. To his left and right stand thirty-six prisons, each fifty li in circumference.\"\n\nWithin these prisons, grasses and trees all bear the baleful, venomous qi of nature, their growth forming blades and sword-points. Abounding in myriad poisons, fierce beasts, and raging flames, they are shrouded in black smoke and howling winds that never cease. Murky darkness and toxic vapors, blood-red miasmas and foul stenches fill the air. Chariots of fire and rivers of ash, iron rods and bronze hammers—tortures and torments resound with wails that shake the heavens. Here dwell the flesh-bound mortals of the Lower Realm, the sinful ghosts and dead souls.\n\nBeyond the cavern-heaven of Supreme Yin, to its left and right, lie three lesser palaces, each fifty *li* in extent, each governed by its own overseer. The first is called the Palace of Heavenly Officials, the second the Palace of Earthly Officials, and the third the Palace of Water Officials—all critical bureaus for the summoning of life and death.\n\nWithin these mountains stand six cavern-palaces, known as the Six Cavern-Palaces of the Supreme Yin Cavern-Heaven. Each spans five thousand *li* in circumference, and together they form the Six Ministries of the Nether Bureau. Each palace is presided over by a great demon-king, who commands a host of thirty-six myriad lesser officers—all monstrous and malevolent spirits of grotesque forms, some assuming the shapes of fish and dragons, serving as his guards. Their cavern-gates lie hidden in the boundless obscurity of the Great Void, perpetually veiled by swirling mists. Without the supreme power of the Heavenly Emperor, none may approach. These are the Six Palaces of the Demon-Kings of the Six Heavens, whose ghosts descend into the mortal realm to bewilder and confuse. They devour the blood and essence of pregnant women, inducing nightmares and evil thoughts. Some take the forms of cats or dogs to startle women, causing pallor, blood depletion, madness, and wasting illnesses. They feast upon the lives of mortal children, from infancy to ten years of age, cutting short those whose allotted span is not yet exhausted. The foolish and deluded, unable to cultivate spirit or prolong life, fall prey to these demonic forces and forfeit their destined years. These demons also bind the Nine Ancestral and Seven Generational kin of the living, interrogating them by name and entangling them in shared suffering—afflicting them with all manner of ailments: emaciation, sores, ulcers, festering wounds, scabies, leprosy, madness, blindness, deafness, and blockages. They bring calamities of wind and water, wandering souls, and nightmares; they bind with willow fetters, whip and beat, and impose extraordinary restraints, inflicting countless diseases too numerous to recount. They falsely seize the living’s years, fate, Three Hun, and Seven Po, submitting them to the Six Palaces, erasing their names from the register of the living and inscribing them in the ledger of the dead. Bedridden for years, their bodies transformed, they seek blood and sustenance. Some become the uncanny apparitions of female shamans, shaking bells and drums in ancient trees; others take the forms of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, or ancient kings, adorned with tassels and sashes. Some appear as demon-maidens of the Six Heavens, richly dressed and alluring; others as fierce generals or treacherous ministers of past dynasties, wielding halberds and swords. Some manifest as great generals of the heavens, riding the qi of the sun, moon, and stars through the mortal realm; others as the likenesses of the living’s seven generations of buried ancestors. Some assume the shapes of wild beasts, riding flying birds or driving serpents and rats, their five-colored radiance bewitching youths and maidens. Some possess strange trees or uncanny stones; others lurk in ancient caves or springs. A thousand forms, a hundred transformations—all to slaughter and harm the living. When pressed, they may seek arcane methods of restraint or suppression, but if their power proves insufficient, they retreat into their caverns, beyond pursuit. Against such evils, those without great might cannot prevail. Some possess the power to move mountains, uproot trees, summon clouds, and stir rain—unrestrainable forces.\n\nThen, Miao Xing addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: \"Though I am dull-witted, I humbly beseech your sacred power. Today, I request to lead the True Immortals, Flying Immortals, and Dragon-Riders of the Three Heavens to descend into the mortal realm and subdue these demons, that the living of the Lower Realm may be spared their torment.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied to Miao Xing: \"I do not send you forth to test your sincerity. Since you seek to subdue these evil spirits and perform a virtuous deed, you shall proceed.\"\n\nThereupon, Miao Xing arose from the Dharma assembly, leading the Three Heavenly Elders, the Ten Ultimate True Immortals, their celestial riders and flying generals, with heavenly music guiding the way. They journeyed due north, following the dense black qi until, several *li* above the mortal realm, their dragon-cranes ceased to advance, their cloud-chariots stalled, and their retinue of attendants recoiled, unable to press forward.\n\nThen, from among the assembly, a True Lord of the White Chariot and White Horse spoke to Miao Xing: \"The mortal realm below is thick with the stench of corpses and the foul qi of ghosts. We are the purest of the Three Clarities, beings of golden form and jade substance, companions of purity. To encounter such filth is unbearable—we cannot descend. We must return to heaven; to proceed further is impossible.\"\n\nThereupon, Miao Xing led the Daoist assembly back to the Heaven of Supreme Yang, where they prostrated before the Heavenly Venerable, kneeling to address him: \"Yesterday, I accompanied the Three Heavenly Elders, the Ten Ultimate True Immortals, and their celestial retinue to descend into the mortal realm and subdue the demonic spirits, to save and protect the living. Yet upon reaching the place, mere *ren* above the earth, our dragon-cranes would not advance, and our attendants and true followers all recoiled, overwhelmed by the foul and toxic miasma of the demonic spirits. I do not know by what method or art the living may be spared this devastation.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then said to Miao Xing: \"At the summit of Mount Fengdu, on the northern frontier of the Void Origin, resides the Divine Lord of the North, who commands an innumerable host of mighty demon-kings, celestial soldiers, and thunderous storm spirits of the yin realm—possessing immense power. Without the Divine Lord of the North, none can subdue them.\"\n\nMiao Xing then addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"By what Daoist power may we summon this Divine Lord of the North, to save the living and spare them from the stench of corpses and daily harm?\"\n\nAt that moment, the Heavenly Venerable clicked his teeth and remotely visualized the Supreme Yin Northern Emperor within the Five Qi Heavens of the North. Thereupon, the Northern Emperor, perceiving from afar, led the Ten Heavenly Demon-Kings, the Eight Radiant Great Spirits, the Thirty-Six Cavern Heaven Ding Warriors, the Three-Five Great Generals, the Lofty Banner Five Lakes Great General, the Valiant Northern Dipper Seven Primes Great General, the Guarding Spirits, the Innumerable Flying Thunder and Lightning Officers, the Mighty Beasts and Poisonous Dragons, and all lesser spirit-officers, along with the Great Power Flying Heavenly Ghost Hosts of the Northern Yin—all assembling at once at the appointed gathering place. There, girded with swords and jade pendants, holding tablets and pacing with measured steps, he twice bowed and knelt, saying: \"Since I last attended your sacred banquet, barely ten kalpas have passed. Today, I remotely receive your secret decree and am granted the honor of beholding your holy countenance. I do not know what command or task the Most Sacred One has summoned me to perform.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable addressed the Northern Emperor: \"The yin ghosts and demons of the Northern Darkness have emerged into the human realm, wrongfully slaughtering more than half of the living. Now, in this year of the Three Nines and Seven Fives, the living are benighted, and the harm wrought by ghosts and demons is especially severe. Their allotted lifespans unfulfilled, countless numbers are cut down untimely. Their yin souls do not disperse, lingering and coalescing in the dark paths. Innumerable grieving spirits surge upward, shaking heaven. You, together with the Ten Cavern Demon-Kings and the Three-Five Generals and officers, must descend to the human world and restrain these yin ghosts. When your merit is complete and your virtue aligned, you shall ascend into the formless and naturally attain the true ultimate.\"\n\nThereupon, the Northern Emperor twice bowed and received the command. He assembled the Ten Heavenly Great Demon-Kings, the Three-Five Great Generals, the soldiers and officers under the Three Masters, the Heavenly Peng Killing Lads, the Northern Dipper Killing Officers, the Mighty Beast Flying Officers, the Owl-Hooked Lasso Flying Officers, the Supreme Perfected Spirits, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Heavenly Couriers and Armored Soldiers, the Southern Dipper Demon-Slaying Envoys, the Northern Dipper Torch-and-Chariot Divine Officers, with purple qi surging forth and flowing fire stretching for ten thousand miles, descending into the human realm. Before the yin ghosts had even glimpsed the heavenly troops, ten days prior, they had already all encountered the Northern Emperor’s Supreme Mystery Killing Qi, which first shattered their brains, killing more than half. As the Northern Emperor descended, the skies and earth were swept asunder. Above, the Heavenly Net was spread; below, the Earthly Web was laid. The Heavenly Couriers and fierce beasts charged forth with gnashing teeth. The Heavenly Ding Flying Officers severed and smashed, crushing all. Some, not yet transformed in shape, had no place to hide. Some became dragons or serpents; others took the form of demonic maidens. Within seven days, all were restrained and destroyed.\n\nThereupon, the Northern Emperor led the heavenly troops back to the Upper Prime Heaven. In the Eight Radiant Jade Palace, he paid homage to the Heavenly Venerable: \"I, having received your sacred decree, descended to the lower realm and subdued the yin demons. Within seven days, I have broken the Six Cavern Ghost Palaces of Mount Fengdu in the North. I have assigned one Great Power Demon-King to each cavern, commanding them to guard and suppress it firmly.\"\n\nThen the Northern Emperor addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"In the lower realm, during the Three Nines and Seven Fives of the human world, many have accumulated great wickedness and transgressions. Deeply deluded and heavily burdened, they have summoned the cavern demons, who remotely exploit their depletion and secretly emerge into the human world. Some may not have been fully restrained, or when a person’s allotted lifespan nears its end, the yin caverns open of their own accord. If not forbidden and controlled, they will spread throughout the human world—across the Four Seas and Five Lakes, the Seven Marshes and Nine Rivers, the Five Peaks and Twenty-Four Grotto-Heavens, the mountains and rivers, pits and caves—becoming disasters for humanity. I have dispatched three hundred thousand troops to constantly patrol the human realm, rescuing the living from dire straits. If one recites my divine name and chants this incantation once, upon hearing it, the demon-ghosts will all have their brains shattered.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"In the lands of the lower realm’s living, should there be years of famine and grain scarcity, the Three Disasters of warfare, or pestilence spreading widely, causing the people of the nation to perish and blood to flow like rivers, one must purify oneself and seek the Three Cavern Daoist Masters. At the northern gate of the nation, establish and erect a Northern Dipper Seven Primes altar, light lamps, scatter flowers, perform the Daoist rites, and submit memorials. Recite my Six Heavenly Spirit Incantations, circumambulating for seven days, fourteen days, or forty-nine days. At that time, I shall lead the Three-Five Great Generals, the Heavenly Peng Division, the Ten Heavenly Demon-Kings, the innumerable hosts, the Great Power Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Flying Thunder and Lightning Cavalry, the Owl-Hooked Lasso Cavalry Divine Kings, the Ten-Thousand-Zhang Mighty Sword Southern Dipper Great Spirits, the Northern Dipper Envoys, with purple qi and flowing fire, to conceal and protect that place, sweeping away demon-ghosts, pestilence, bloodshed, and the foul, turbid miasma, rendering all pure and clear.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"In the lower realm, when women are pregnant and suffer miscarriage or death, their descendants fail to thrive in nineteen out of twenty cases. Some carry a child for one or two months, or even to term, but the fetus perishes in the womb, or the child grows to seven or ten years old before dying untimely. This is all because the woman’s blood and impurity attract the Six Cavern Heaven Demon-Mothers and Ghost-Mothers, who fly after the woman, consuming her essence and qi, repeatedly harming the fetus and blood. This causes the woman to become emaciated, sallow, and weak, plagued by nightmares and terrifying visions. These ghosts transform into cats, rats, civets, or dogs, devouring the woman’s offspring in her dreams. One must purify the halls and chambers, seek out Daoist masters, and according to the rites, establish an altar to worship the Northern Dipper Seven Prime Lords. Burn incense, light lamps, recite my divine incantations, perform the Daoist rites, and offer repentance. For one to seven days, I shall dispatch the Twelve Supreme Mystery Night-Luminous Jade Maidens to guard the woman, ensuring no harm befalls her and all comes to fruition. If, during a difficult childbirth, the Ghost-Mother obstructs and the Northern Yin’s impure ghosts seek to feed, devouring the birthing mother’s blood, causing her excruciating pain for a day or seven days—suffering unbearable agony, moaning day and night—one must purify the courtyard, establish an altar, perform the rites, and recite the incantations. I shall send the Nine Mystery Killing Lads and the Six Ding Jade Maidens to protect the birthing mother, sparing her from pain. The children she bears, whether male or female, will all be extraordinary in appearance, upright, intelligent, noble, and successful.\"\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan encounter celestial calamities and pestilential epidemics, or suffer from raging febrile toxins that confine all to bed, with misfortunes arising unbidden—whether malevolent ghosts seize their dwellings, or false disasters afflict their fate and natal stars, bringing cangues, fetters, imprisonment, and years of confinement, blocking all four directions; or long illness binds their souls, held captive by demonic spirits in the nether bureaus; or wasting ghosts obstruct their fortunes, scattering wealth and diminishing destiny, rendering all endeavors futile—then, in accordance with the ritual statutes, they must submit memorials and petitions, perform jiao offerings to the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper and the Five Planets and Twenty-Eight Constellations, practice the Dao, recite incantations, light lamps, and scatter flowers for one, three, seven, or forty-nine days. I shall command the Life-Recording Lord of the Northern Dipper to expunge their names from the Black Register, and the Custodian Lord of the Southern Dipper to amend their entries in the Book of Life. Their years shall be extended, their lives prolonged, and disasters transformed into blessings. All mad and perverse demonic spirits shall be driven away and slain by the Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens and the Generals of the Three and Five, preventing them from causing further harm.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan seek to study the Dao yet fail midway, becoming lost, confused, and unable to progress, they must purify themselves through fasting and bathing, then recite my divine incantation—seven times or up to a hundred—whether walking, standing, or resting, regardless of defilement. As long as the heart holds the recitation, the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper shall descend, infusing their hearts with pure qi, dispelling inner demons, fortifying the body with a hundred spirits, stabilizing their inner sanctuary, unblocking the heart’s orifices, and invigorating the spirit. Thus, their studies shall bear fruit.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan traverse great seas, rivers, or lakes and encounter storms with thunder, lightning, and crashing waves, or journey through perilous mountains, forests, and valleys at dusk, spending nights in the wilderness amid the terrors of wolves, tigers, dragons, serpents, and spectral horrors—they must purify their hearts, sit upright, and silently recite this incantation twenty-one times. Then, the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens, the Great General Tianpeng, and their divine hosts, along with the deities of the wilds, the Eight Radiant Spirit Kings, the gods of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, rivers, streams, and valleys, and the local earth spirits shall descend in response, encircling and protecting them. Fear shall vanish, safety ensured, their spirits calmed, and all malevolent forces dispersed.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan remain childless, it is because the Cavern-Heaven Demon Maidens and Ghost-Mothers, along with the Celestial Wolf and the Greedy Dog, devour their essence, severing their lineage. To conceive a child, they must set up a Northern Dipper lamp altar in their chamber, follow a master in practicing the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, recite my divine incantation ten thousand times, and offer morning jiao rites to the Northern Dipper. Then, the Twelve Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist shall descend to guard their womb, fulfilling their wish for offspring—children of exceptional appearance, intelligence, and longevity, whether male or female.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan purify their bodies and minds, reciting this incantation seven times or up to a hundred daily, whether in motion or at rest, morning or evening, all their endeavors shall succeed. Even in gambling or seeking profit, or when meeting nobles and rulers, they shall always find joy, their wishes harmonized.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should the five grains sown in the fields of the Lower Yuan be ravaged by locusts or other disasters, they must erect an altar in the field and recite the incantation seven or forty-nine times in accordance with the ritual statutes. I shall command the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces and the Earth Thearch to enforce a three-day prohibition, and all pestilent insects shall vanish of their own accord.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: These are the Six Demon Kings of the Six Cavern-Heavens, who perpetrate six harms upon those born in the Lower Yuan. The First Palace harms wealth, causing depletion and dissipation. The Second Palace harms life, obstructing success and causing official rank to decline. The Third Palace harms rank and emolument, blocking all four directions. The Fourth Palace harms fields, dwellings, and households, bringing frequent deaths, disasters, and spectral disturbances, rendering habitation unstable. The Fifth Palace harms wives and concubines, causing repeated deaths, from one to seven. The Sixth Palace harms children, preventing their birth or causing illness and extinction. These six harms are perpetrated by the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens, who conspire with the Six Bureaus of the Caverns to obstruct and afflict mortals. Those of resolve who wish to eliminate them must do so in a pure wilderness or a quiet chamber of an ancient altar, erecting an altar and practicing the Dao according to the ritual statutes for three, seven, or up to forty-nine days. They must submit a memorial, called the \"Six Harms Memorial Jiao,\" to the Six Jia Spirits, the Five Planets, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Palaces of the Sun and Moon. They must also wear the Great Register for Dissolving the Six Harms of the Three and Five. Then, the One Hundred Twenty Jade Lads of the Nine Palaces shall descend, along with the Great Generals for Dissolving Harms, the great spirits within the Northern Dipper, and the hosts of Tianpeng. They shall traverse the Six Yin Palaces of the Caverns, investigating and resolving each source of harm, permanently severing the calamities so they no longer entangle mortals.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan be conscripted by kings or nobles for battle, they must wear the Great Register of the Nine Palaces for Warding Off the Six Palaces and Averting Corpses, offer sacrifices to the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, and inscribe this incantation within the register, wearing it on the left arm. When facing the enemy in battle, they must silently recite the divine incantation seven times. Then, the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens, the Great General Tianpeng, the Envoys of the Northern Dipper, and the Great Generals of the Three Primordials shall secretly protect them, preventing injury and ensuring safety, forever averting the misfortune of violent death.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan face harm from evil persons, they must visualize the malefactor beneath their left foot and recite this incantation one hundred thirty times. The evil person shall then turn misfortune into fortune.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Those born in the Lower Yuan who know the names of the Six Heavenly Offices of Fengdu shall find that the hundred ghosts dare not harm them. Whenever one wishes to sleep, one must first face north, click the teeth seven times, and recite the incantation thrice in a soft voice, saying:\n\nI am a minister of the Thearch,\nmy name inscribed in Jade Purity,\ngoverning the Six Heavens below.\nThe ghostly palaces of the Northern Thearch\nare all within my command.\nOf those under my jurisdiction,\nwhat ghost dare arise?\nOn my left hangs the *huoluo* blade,\non my right the fire-bell.\nI hurl fire ten thousand leagues,\nmy might subduing the thousand spirits.\nThose who offend shall be slain,\nthose who trespass shall be punished.\nBy the Thearch’s decree,\ntheir capture shall not cease.\nHeavenly light shakes in terror,\nthe host of demons takes flight to the east.\nGhosts and demons are annihilated,\nand I attain long life.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Thearch’s decree and ordinance command.\n\nAccording to the *Heavenly Pass Three Charts, Highest Clarity Scripture*: Mount Fengdu lies in the north, in the *gui* region, thus the northeast is the Ghost Gate, the root of dead *qi*. The mountain rises two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Its cavern-palaces lie beneath the mountain, with a circumference of fifteen thousand *li*. Above and below, there are ghostly and divine halls. Atop the mountain are twelve palaces governing ghosts, and below are twelve palaces ruling spirits. Each palace spans a thousand *li* in circumference. Above, six palaces lie to the left and six to the right; below, six lie to the left and six to the right—thus twenty-four palaces in all.\n\nThe names of the upper six palaces are:\n1. The Palace of Zhou’s Absolute Yin\n2. The Palace of Tai’s Punitive Judgment\n3. The Palace of Bright Dawn’s Enduring Offense\n4. The Palace of Serene Illumination’s Sinful *Qi*\n5. The Palace of Ancestral Numinosity’s Seven Transgressions\n6. The Palace of Daring Governance’s Boundless Connections\n\nThe names of the lower six palaces are:\n1. The Palace of Restful Clarity’s General Numinosity\n2. The Palace of Mysterious Governance’s Weighty Rectitude\n3. The Palace of Uniting Immortals’ Ascendant Subtlety\n4. The Palace of Upright Perfection’s Lingering Governance\n5. The Palace of Cloudy Storehouses’ Jade Records\n6. The Palace of Lofty Emptiness’ Crimson Radiance\n\nReciting this incantation once shall first strike terror into heaven and earth, binding the myriad demons. Reciting it twice shall annihilate ghosts and demons, severing the dead names of the Six Heavens. Those who study the Dao yet do not know the names of the Fengdu palaces—the domains of gods and ghosts—shall be unable to cut off the root of death, rendering all later learners incapable of success.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Those born in the Lower Yuan, whether man or woman, when traveling at night or lying down to sleep, who recite the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces shall cause all ghostly demons to hear and dissolve into bloody pulp. They must not recite loudly, for this harms ghosts all the more. If one recites the incantation without affliction, one must first make a vow: \"I recite the names of the Six Heavenly Gates to pacify the hun and settle the po, without harming the netherworld.\" This incantation reads:\n\nZhou’s Absolute marks the Thearch’s dawn,\nJudgment’s weight constructs the second.\nFlaming as clouds in the sky,\nbursting like radiant splendor.\nA divine peak at Martial City,\nSerene Illumination swallows the Azure River.\nThe Gate of Heaven looms over the Cinnabar Well,\nCloud Gate rises in towering majesty.\nSeven Transgressions link the wondrous canopy,\nBoundless Connections spread their demonic sway.\nThe Six Heavens cross the northern path—\nthis is the home of gods and ghosts.\n\nExpel the Poisonous Tiger King,\nthe Six Heavenly Ghost Kings,\nthe Thunderclap and Gathered Bells,\nthe Northern Thearch’s Demon Kings,\nthe Four Heavenly Luminaries,\nthe Fengdu Ghost Ministers,\nBa Yuan’s Ugly Earl,\nthe Nine Heavens’ Registers—\nall great demons under my command,\ndare you not obey?\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: This incantation I have spoken is called the Northern Thearch’s Divine Incantation, for it crushes and devours the ghostly gods of the Six Heavens. Those born in the Lower Yuan—whether old or young, man or woman, poor or humble—who recite this divine incantation while walking, sitting, or resting shall find all their desires fulfilled. All demonic ghosts shall retreat and disperse, and one’s spirit and *qi* shall flourish. With single-minded resolve and steadfastness, all obstacles shall be removed, and all one seeks shall align with the Dao.\n\nThe Northern Black Thearch’s Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Divine Incantation—whenever one holds and recites it, first visualize the Heavenly Peng Divine General: four-faced, six-armed, each hand wielding a halberd, sword, bow and arrow, golden spear, *yinmou*, and halberd, his body fifty *zhang* in height, clad in golden spear armor, radiant for ten thousand *li*, his roar shaking the earth. Leading a divine host of three hundred thousand, clad in black robes and dark crowns, they descend to suppress and extinguish evil spirits. Strike the left teeth thirty-six times, then the right teeth thirty-six times, then sound the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times.

I shall command the Thirty Cavern Lords of the North, the Heavenly Peng Great General, the Ten Poles and Eight Sceneries’ Great Flying Divine Beasts, and hidden ferocious beasts, never leaving the living, encircling and guarding them, so that all attachments and desires encounter no obstacles. Recite this incantation either seven times, or up to forty-nine times, or one hundred twenty times, then strike the teeth, sound the Heavenly Drum, and strike the Heavenly Chime, each thirty-six times. Then recite this subsequent incantation three or seven times before retiring; there is no harm in doing so outside. This is called the Heaven and Earth Purification Incantation. For any defilement in one’s dwelling, constantly recite the Defilement-Dispelling, Corpse-Averting Incantation:\n\nAs the scripture states, strike the teeth so that inner and outer are emptied and resonant, as if heard by the ear.\nWithin the Cavern’s Mysterious Void, radiant and vast is the Great Primordial.\nThe mighty gods of the eight directions make me natural.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Talisman’s Decree universally proclaims to the Nine Heavens:\n*Qianluo Danna*, penetrating the Firmament’s Great Mystery.\nSevering demons, binding evil, slaying ten thousand ghosts.\nThe Central Mountain’s divine incantation, the Primordial Jade Scripture’s text.\nI recite it once, and demons retreat while years extend.\nTraversing the Five Peaks, the Eight Seas take heed.\nDemon kings submit, guarding my chamber.\nMalevolence and defilement disperse, the Dao’s qi eternally abides.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\nThe Dao states: This incantation is the Northern Emperor’s esoteric method. Should one in the world obtain it and constantly practice it, one may subdue all evils, augment fortune and lifespan, prolong years and avert calamities, dispel disasters and repel misfortunes, protect the living, and prevent unjust harm. Both men and women, young and old, may all uphold it.\n\nMaster Tao of the Pottery said: Long ago, when I studied the Dao at Tiantai but had not yet attained accomplishment, I was constantly harassed by mountain ghosts—appearing in bodily form, unclothed, startling and terrifying me. Though I had often heard of this Dao, I had never practiced it. After observing the precepts and practicing for seven days, I walked through my dwelling’s surroundings, and a hundred paces beyond the chamber, I saw blood flowing across the ground, the stench of corpses and foul odors filling the valley. I heard the sound of weeping, its words piteous and sorrowful.\n\nThey cried out: \"Tao Hongjing, Tao Hongjing, you have seized our dwelling and harmed our lives!\" Thereafter, they never again raised their voices in such clamor. With prolonged recitation, one may wander in the company of the hundred spirits, and long life may be attained.\n\nMaster Wang the Perfected said: My former teacher, Celestial Master Zhang, by the command of the Most High, battled to seize the twenty-four demonic encampments of Shu Prefecture, rescuing and protecting the living. In a single battle against the great demonic chieftains of the twenty-four encampments, he subdued them all at once, confining their underlings and officers beneath the encampments. Now they have become the twenty-four mountain prisons for demons, utterly unable to escape. All this was achieved by the Most High’s transmission of this Divine Incantation of the Northern Emperor. When my teacher confronted the demons with a single recitation, the celestial soldiers and the three to five great generals of the Tianpeng host descended at once. None failed to submit—this is the ninth stellar spirit of Tianpeng.\n\nZheng Siyuan said: I once heard that the Northern Flower Immortal of the Most High taught this Dao to novice Daoists, instructing them to recite it ten thousand times. First, it extinguishes inauspicious specters and malevolent spirits, and the true Dao is immediately revealed. I longed for this but could not obtain it. Later, on Eastern Flower Mountain, I encountered the Left Immortal Elder, who said to me: \"If you wish to receive the talismanic charts and divine incantations of the Great Emperor of Mount Fengdu in the Northern Feng, to perform rituals, dispel evil, and expel demons, thereby attaining the Dao of cultivating truth, you must offer silk, incense, and oil as a pledge of sincerity. Only then will I transmit this to you—this is the Dao of the Primordial Lady of the Great Simplicity, the Mysterious Mother. It must not be recklessly passed to deluded and disordered men, or to those who are but walking corpses and wandering bones. If one fails to revere it, calamity will extend to one’s ancestors.\" I received it and thereby beheld the true Dao.\n\nThese subtle and secret matters are not fully recorded here. Many derive from the *Upper Clarity Jade Emperor’s Scripture of Divine Wisdom for Dispelling Demons and Concealing the Jade Clarity*. The rituals and methods follow those in the lower scroll.\n\nThe Northern Flower Immortal said to Zheng Siyuan: \"Whenever reciting this divine incantation, one must tap the teeth once for each phrase as a regular practice—this is the ritual for cultivating truth. If reciting it day and night without pause, the tapping of teeth may be omitted. Should a living person encounter demonic affliction, sit upright according to the method and follow the four-syllable rhythm for tapping the teeth. Alternatively, first tap the teeth seven times, then recite the incantation three times. Tap the teeth seven times again, recite it three more times, and once more tap the teeth seven times. Then state the wish in your heart, and the demonic spirits causing harm will all go blind, their eyes fester, and they will die. This divine incantation comprises the names of the demon-slaying offices, the secret words of the Northern Emperor. If one masters this method and practices it regularly, abstaining from meat, impure foods, and miscellaneous indulgences, one may repel all evils, increase blessings and longevity, prolong life and avert calamities, dispel disasters and ward off misfortune, and protect the living from untimely harm.\n\nAs the scripture states: When tapping the teeth, the sound should resonate internally, clear enough to be heard by the ear.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the Northern Flower Immortal: \"In recitation, one must purify the heart and focus the mind, avoiding all杂事 and heterodox methods. Do not share the same chamber, for these are guarded by the malevolent spirits of the Six Heavens. If worldly people treat this as mere casual recitation or entertainment, failing to revere it with devotion and slighting the true words, the Heavenly Venerable of the North will be enraged, and boundless calamities will follow. Be cautious and reverent.\"\n\nAt that time, the assembly of celestial sages and great worthies, upon hearing this scripture’s method of salvation and protection, all rejoiced and leapt for joy. They awakened the supreme Dao-mind, advanced in rank by natural progression, and, bearing the majestic power of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning, bowed their heads in reverence and pledged to uphold it.\n\nThus concludes the *First Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantation, Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning*.\n\n**Second Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantation, Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning: The Secret Teachings of the Seven Primes**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy journeyed through the celestial realms, establishing domains and delivering the people, broadly proclaiming the wondrous Dao. Observing the mortals of the Lower Realm beset by calamities, demonic influences, and malevolent qi, with the Nine Uglies’ spirits unjustly harming the good and virtuous, he reflected: \"The Three Realms turn like a wheel, with grievances and enmities multiplying endlessly. Lands are unsettled, and warfare arises—how may salvation be brought to protect the multitudes?\"\n\nThereupon, he summoned the Perfected Lord of the Northern Emperor and expounded the method of deliverance. The Northern Emperor replied: \"By the decree of Fengdu, I subdue ghosts and dispel demons through the altar of the Seven Primes, safeguarding households and pacifying nations. As the Great Sage commands, I shall descend with true numinosity.\"\n\nHearing the Northern Emperor’s secret and essential response, the Heavenly Worthy assented and pledged to uphold it. The Northern Emperor declared: \"This incantation is most wondrous. One should maintain a prolonged fast and recite it diligently to attain longevity and ascend through the void.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor’s Incantation of Division-Body states:\nI solemnly command the five true officials within my body:\nMy *hun*-soul is the Heavenly Father,\nMy *po*-soul is the Earthly Mother,\nMy head is Lord Thunder,\nMy hair is black clouds,\nMy crown is the Bright Star,\nMy brain is the Vermilion Bird,\nMy eyebrows are the Qilin,\nMy eyes are the sun and moon,\nMy nose is the Mighty Tiger,\nMy upper lip is the Earl of Wind,\nMy lower lip is the Master of Rain,\nMy tongue is the Governor of the Nine Provinces,\nMy throat is the Jade Armillary,\nMy left arm is the Jade Balance that repels foes,\nMy right arm is the Jade Balance that shatters enemies,\nMy palms are fire chariots,\nMy fingers are armored soldiers,\nMy two breasts are immortal youths,\nMy skull is Mount Heng,\nMy spine is Mount Peng,\nMy ribs are the famed mountains,\nMy belly is a golden fortress,\nMy liver is the Azure Emperor,\nMy kidneys are the Black Emperor,\nMy spleen is the Yellow Emperor,\nMy heart is the Crimson Emperor,\nMy lungs are the White Emperor,\nMy gallbladder is the Great One,\nMy intestines are dragons and tigers,\nMy armpits are forbidden prisons,\nMy navel is the rivers and lakes,\nMy testicles are the Weaving Maiden,\nMy bladder is the River Earl,\nMy blood is river water,\nMy vessels are the Flying Serpents,\nMy stomach is the Curved Array,\nMy skin is the Heavenly Net,\nMy flesh is the Earthly Web,\nMy buttocks are *zhūn* (sound),\nMy yin is the Eight Barbarians,\nMy thighs are the Twin Lads,\nMy knees are *kūn* (sound),\nMy shins are lions,\nMy feet are white horses,\nMy hands are the Three Generals,\nEach leading seventy million troops.\nThe soldiers draw blades and unsheathe swords,\nMounting fire chariots to emerge from my body.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThis incantation subdues all ghosts and spirits.\nFor madness or possession, recite it thrice.\nFor minor afflictions, do not recite it, lest it harm the child’s *hun* and *po*.\nBeware.\n\nThe Celestial Canopy Incantation for Entering the Chamber and Dispelling Illness:\nHark! I am the son of the Celestial Thearch and the Most High,\nSent by the Venerable Lord.\nMy head bears the sun and moon,\nMy body is girded with the Northern Dipper.\n\nI command the celestial troops of the Qian spirit, a hundred million strong, arrayed at my left and right. Before me boil cauldrons of ten thousand *shi*, behind me gleam axes of yellow gold. I attend upon the Most High when suddenly divine generals appear, teaching me the method to slay ghosts and bestowing upon me the formula to behead spirits. I bear the Great Simplicity talisman upon my person, gathering and seizing all inauspicious forces. I proclaim to the Celestial Thearch, summoning the officers and soldiers. My head wears the flowered canopy, my feet tread upon the *kuigang*. What spirit does not flee? What ghost dares stand before me? Bound, you shall surely be; punished, your wanton harm shall cease.\n\nThe afflicted bear no guilt—how dare you rashly assail the worthy and good? I contain the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth; my incantation shatters the misfortune of wayward ghosts. When I incant against spirits, spirits self-destruct; when I incant against ghosts, ghosts perish of themselves. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nUpon completion, hold water in the mouth and spray the afflicted.\n\nThen recite again:\nEastern wayward spirits, southern wayward spirits, western wayward spirits, northern wayward spirits, central wayward spirits—hark! You are the fish of *yangli*, or the floating duckweed’s grass, or the worm steeped in stagnant waters: soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, stingrays, eels, and carp. You are the essence of trees and wood, demons and specters, *wangliang*. Assuming human form, you cling to bodies, bewitching men and women. The Northern Thearch hears of this and flies into a great rage. Thus he dispatches me, leading generals, a thousand troops and ten thousand cavalry, to slay you, the hundred wayward ghosts—why do you not flee at once? Swiftly, swiftly, by the might of the Northern Thearch’s sacred sword and the divine king’s statutes and ordinances!\n\nUpon completion, hold water in the mouth and spray the afflicted thrice.\n\nThen recite again:\nI am the son of the Celestial Master’s divine *qi* and the Most High, roaming the world. If illness arises in the East, I can cure it. If illness arises in the South, I can cure it. If illness arises in the West, I can cure it. If illness arises in the North, I can cure it. If illness arises in the Center, I can cure it. I possess the method to cure illness and the formula to heal it. My head wears the crown that pierces the heavens, my body is clad in the robes of the Vermilion Sun. In my hands I grasp the dragon-headed jade-cutting sword, beheading ghostly bandits by the thousands, regardless of their crimes. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nSpray water thrice, then proceed to the five directions. With seven steps and the Seven Primes’ *gang*, face and turn to shatter and establish, reciting the Celestial Canopy Incantation. With a single breath, recite it thrice. For every four words, click the teeth once—this is the method of the art. It subdues all wayward ghosts. Ordinarily, do not click the teeth, lest it harm the spirits. Upon completion, form the palm seal. After sealing, recite:\n\nHark! Radiant essence, central king, your might shakes the Nine Heavens. Golden tigers obscure the sun, flying dragons coil about Qian. The Yellow Spirit wields the battle-axe, Green Teeth brandishes the whip. The *jihen* balances the Five Dipper stars, the Seven Primes are harmonized. The Nine Shameful Ones are captured, the Six Heavens are annihilated. In my hands I hold the Three Luminaries, my feet tread upon the Nine Mysteries. The Eight Awesomenesses spew venom, the Celestial Soldiers lead the way. I hunt and examine demonic essences, dispatching them to the Crooked Springs. The Ten Heavens protect the state, the myriad companions are secure.\n\nThen recite again:\nHeavenly fire falls in torrents, its light illuminating the eight directions. The *Nüqing* ghostly statutes execute and behead wayward misfortune. I now restrain you—what demonic ghost dares stand before me? Depart swiftly, swiftly! Submit, ghostly *kuigang*. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nNext, the incantation to command the five directions:\n\n**East:**\nI rebuke the ghost of the East, essence of rotting wood. The old *qi* of the Nine Yi, born of spring’s transformation. The spirit fails to nurture within and manifests as wayward essence without. The *qi* of the Five Poisons enters the human form, causing alternating chills and fever, the whole body restless. The Nine Shameful ghosts know your name. The Northern Thearch’s divine incantation captures and records your essence. The Four Luminaries shatter your bones, the Northern Dipper blazes bright. With a single stroke of the divine blade, the ten thousand ghosts punish themselves. Chills and headaches, feverish pains—you shall not recklessly arise.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\n**South:**\nRed ghost of the South, essence of scorching fire.

With a single stroke of the divine blade, the ten thousand ghosts punish themselves. Chills and headaches, feverish pains—you shall not recklessly arise. The wood *qi* of the East extinguishes your form. Subdued within the spleen, you shall not stir or topple. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nOnce the Rite of Slaying Pestilence is complete, first recite the Heavenly Peng’s upper incantation. When daily practice is fulfilled on the *jiazi* day, wear the Great Register and establish the Seven Primes Altar. First recite my command to the Five Marchmounts’ Water Incantation:\n\nI am a minister of the Most High, my name inscribed in Jade Clarity, supreme over the Six Heavens. The Northern Thearch’s Ghostly Palace is entirely my domain. All under my command—what ghost dares arise? On my left hangs the *huoluo* blade, on my right the Fire Bell. Casting fire ten thousand leagues, my might subdues a thousand spirits. Those who offend are slain, those who resist are punished. The Imperial Lord commands: seize and capture without cease. Heavenly light and thunderous roars—move, and the myriad evils bind themselves. Ghosts and demons perish utterly; I attain long life. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Imperial Lord says: Upon finishing the incantation, immediately recite my summons to the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings, the Eight Radiant Great Spirits, the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens’ Mighty Powers, the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, the Generals of the Three-Five Forbidden *Qi*, the Guardians of the Numinous, and the Flying Thunderbolt Cavalry Incantation:\n\nBeasts of the Poisonous Heavens, guard the four gates. Divine soldiers by the myriad, the Nine Ugly by the ten thousand. Throats gape to split the sky, fierce steeds gallop high. Poisonous dragons brandish claws, golden heads devour sideways. Mighty warriors by the countless thousands receive the talisman and examine the immortals. The Six Heavens unrestrained, banding malevolence into hordes. Demons, goblins, and specters—foul *qi* swirls in chaos. Hollow songs echo, incense clouds scatter in disarray. Lesser ghosts assume false forms, blocking the Gate of Human Life. What the Divine Kings proclaim, none fail to hear. Above, they seize the Six *Qi*; below, they inspect the river sources. The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways swiftly distinguish good from evil. By the thousands, by the ten thousands, come before me. The Five Thearchs record merits—those with merit are pardoned. Malevolent demons and spirits are bound and lashed. Dare disobey, and none escape execution. Livers are hacked, gall crushed, heads severed, forms annihilated. Northward, the *jue* cleaves the clear broth; southward, fire burns at Nanshan. The Golden Perfected slays *qi*, the Flowing Bell captures souls. No demonic essence remains; all evil sources are swept away. Bearing the Heavenly Script, the Dao’s true writ is followed. The Nine *Qi* are cleansed, the Three Primes made clear. The Mysterious Numinous ascends in truth, uniting with the natural. None dare test me—after the slaying, report to Heaven. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: After reciting the Southern Guardian Incantation, then recite the Altar-Binding Incantation:\n\nThe Vermilion Bird’s radiance presses inward, divine might expands within. The four mountain sources are guarded; ghostly wells flee in terror. The spirit pool exhales *qi*, evil essences hide within. The Soul Terrace’s Four Luminaries, the jade doors gleam. The Jade Perfected stands majestic, seated to guard the Hall of Light. Hands wield the purple aurora, head crowned with divine radiance. Reciting the Grotto Scriptures, thirty-nine chapters. Within lies the demon-expelling, dragon-tiger slaying *gang*. Fierce beasts and charging oxen, blades in jaws, swallowing metal. Uplifting mountains, cauldrons overturning the sky, divine birds and poisonous dragons. Six jaws spew fire, devouring the King of Ghosts. Lightning boars and thunder fathers, dragging stars in streaks. Owls and blazing hybrids, moving crosswind. Heavenly birds arrayed in formation, all beside me. Spewing fire ten thousand fathoms to dispel misfortune. Spirits open the Dao, sealing and casting into mountain villages. A thousand spirits, ten thousand numina, all bow with clasped hands. Marsh wardens hold censers, burning incense for me. Wherever I go, the myriad spirits welcome. Heavenly beasts come to guard, a thousand essences tremble and submit—none dare disturb my *qi*. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nExit the chamber and stand again.\n\n**Talisman for Eradicating Locust Plagues in the Realm**\nThe Northern Thearch says: If a state, prefecture, or county suffers a locust plague, causing the people distress and preventing them from their livelihood, simply establish a Seven Primes Altar before the northern gate of the prefecture. Perform the Dao and cast my two spirit talismans. One talisman, inscribed on raw iron, is thrown into the prefecture’s river, where it transforms into black *qi* piercing the sky, and sweet dew descends. Another talisman, inscribed on catalpa wood with realgar, is buried in the Earth God’s temple, one foot two inches deep—then the locusts will instantly perish.\n\nThe right talisman: Use a square of raw iron, inscribe in cinnabar, and cast into the state’s great river.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: After binding the altar, perform the Dao to seek the heart’s desire. Use a catalpa wood board, one foot two inches long, inscribe it, and bury it in the Earth God’s temple—the locusts will perish.\n\n**Northern Feng Seal for Slaying Ghosts**\nThe Northern Thearch says: For those born in the Lower Prime, whether man or woman, afflicted by mountain *chi* and ancient specters, spirit altars and village shrines, or demonic spirits and wild anomalies causing illness—raving speech, madness, entering water without fear of death—use my Northern Feng Seal to stamp the afflicted’s heart, and the illness will immediately cease. Carve it from jujube wood’s core, perform three annual offerings, then it may be used.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: In the upper scroll of this scripture, I proclaimed the myriad sufferings of those born in the Lower Prime—official talismans and slander, illnesses and calamities, or entering battle and facing enemies, all manner of epilepsy. Simply carry this talisman, and recovery follows the appointed day. Those entering battle wear it on their heads, where one man equals a hundred, forever avoiding the misfortune of blade wounds, as divine soldiers protect them.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: For those born in the Lower Prime with troubled hearts, repeatedly suffering deadly misfortunes, or women whose pregnancies fail, or men and women dying prematurely, or those wronged by evil people’s schemes, cursed and punished—simply suppress it with my Fire Bell Imperial Register for great fortune.\n\nThe right talisman is from the *Hengshan Record*.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: To seal mountains and peaks, command ancient temples, summon the Five Marchmounts’ spirits to reveal past and future events, or to move mountains and overturn seas, and to expel demonic spirits.\n\nPlace this talisman upon a mirror, inscribe it with cinnabar, and suspend it above the Seven Primes Altar. Two hundred feet from the altar, recite the Heavenly Peng Mantra upon the altar, and the ghosts and spirits will appear before you, promptly answering questions of future events.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: Whenever performing rituals for all under Heaven, choose the days of *jiazi* or *gengshen*. If transmitted to the unworthy, it will cause madness, illness, and death—proceed with reverence and caution. Should one holding the mantra consume the Five Pungents with an impure mouth, the Heavenly Peng General will glare in wrath, causing the person’s spirit and soul to fall, leading to madness and possession, which is most difficult to cure.\n\nAfter completing the rites to the Seven Spirits, take the seven cups of wine from the altar and drink them. After seven days, divine powers will arise naturally, wisdom will flourish in the heart, and one’s dignity and wonder will radiate—guard this secret, for its efficacy is profound.\n\n**Altar Ritual and Palm Chart**\nThe Northern Thearch says: The wondrous scripture I expound can dispel celestial disasters above and stabilize the imperial seal below, eliminating inauspicious omens. Proclaim it to all good practitioners. Should a nation possess this text, all under Heaven will receive blessings. Should the world hold this text, dragons and spirits will guard and protect. Should one dwell in the mountains with this text, all evil will tremble and submit. When the power of divine transformation stirs, thirty thousand soldiers will follow in its wake.\n\nThis text is no ordinary discourse—its intent is fierce and mighty. It must not be transmitted carelessly, leaked, or treated with disrespect, nor may those who defy the true canon receive it.\n\nAt that time, the Four Assemblies and all perfected ones addressed the Northern Thearch, saying: By what name should this scripture be called?\n\nThe Northern Thearch replied: It is titled *The Divine Mantra Wondrous Canon: The Seven Primes Subduing Demons Sutra*. Let it be transmitted in secrecy and upheld for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**The Supreme Northern Thearch’s Plain Spirit Talisman for Beheading Evil and Destroying Demons and Ghosts**—should one wear it, it preserves life and extends years. If affixed within a chamber door, it dispels all demonic spirits and ghosts, as the talisman’s envoys behead evil and destroy ghosts, bringing great fortune.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery Northern Thearch’s First Divine Talisman**—for disciples of the Lower Prime who cultivate the Dao: if worn, it grants long life and eternal vision, repelling corpses and beheading evil to destroy demons. Affixed within a hall or chamber, it dispels all demonic spirits and specters, as the talisman’s envoys behead evil and destroy ghosts.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Second Talisman: The Fengdu Upper Clarity Divine Talisman, the Great Register for Repelling Corpses**—the Supreme Three-Five Elixir manifests yin and yang, driving away and subduing demonic spirits. It overturns heaven and earth, beheading all evil demons. Each is subdued and made to protect the body, granting long life and destroying ghosts.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Third Talisman**—cures all illnesses. Worn to protect the body and life, it restrains all ghosts, beheads evil, binds spirits, dispels disasters, eliminates misfortune, repels evil to restore rectitude, safeguards the person, and grants long life and eternal vision.\n\n**The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Fourth Talisman**—expounds the Northern Thearch’s true scripture, the jade text register for repelling corpses, saving and healing the people’s illnesses and calamities. This jade-character divine talisman is bestowed to execute and behead demonic specters. Should one wear it upon the head, it repels corpses for a thousand *li*. If demonic spirits or specters afflict a household, affix the talisman within the hall or chamber, and all will be beheaded and annihilated.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Fifth Talisman**—beheads flying corpses, demonic specters, and evil spirits, and breaks the misfortune of households plagued by death. Those harmed should wear it to protect their lives, bringing great fortune.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Sixth Talisman**—averts disasters of water and fire. Worn upon the body or affixed within a door to pacify a dwelling, it brings great fortune.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Seventh Talisman**—cures those afflicted by pestilential epidemics, miasmic poisons, and demonic plagues. Those suffering should wear this talisman to attain eternal peace, as evil ghosts are destroyed.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Eighth Talisman**—purifies defilement, repels evil, drives away demons, and dispatches specters, preventing harm to people. It preserves life, protects the body, and extends years, bringing great fortune.\n\nThe preceding eight talismans, bestowed by the Five Spirits Mysterious Elder Thearch, can save all sentient beings from disasters, epidemics, and illnesses. Those who wear my golden script and jade talismans will universally attain peace and happiness. Their divine efficacy is immense, far from a minor merit.\n\nHere ends the second scroll of *The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Divine Mantra Wondrous Canon of the Northern Thearch Subduing Demons*.\n\n**The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Divine Mantra Wondrous Canon of the Northern Thearch Subduing Demons, Scroll Three: The Fengdu Chapter on Slaying Ghosts**\n\nThe Dao speaks: The Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction, at that time, was within the Cloud Radiance Palace atop the Ultimate Divine Elixir, seated upon the Mystic Terrace’s treasure throne in the Fivefold Luminance Palace. Ten wondrous spirit banners hung down; he wore a mantle of parted net, a flowered crown of precious radiance, a flying phoenix feathered skirt, and cloud-brocade shoes adorned with jade blossoms and seed-pearl patterns. In his hands he held a scepter of green jade, a case of seven treasures, and a cloud-brocade phoenix-patterned desk. His ornaments were of fluorite and blossoming jade; a fragrant censer of jade phoenix stood before him, along with a divine tiger-and-dragon sword. A luminous jade table of flying clouds and phoenix qi stood beside him, with a kingly lynx-feather whisk. Realized beings stood in attendance to his left and right, arrayed in ranks, gazing upon his august countenance.\n\nThe Mudra of the Northern Thearch: the thumb clasps the little finger, the four fingers press upon the thumb, while the second, third, and fifth fingers remain straight.\n\nAt that time, the Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction suddenly smiled faintly, stirring his dharma-sound. Divine radiance blazed forth, suffusing the ten directions and the boundless worlds.\n\nThen, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the Eastern Direction, with his retinue of nine thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat. The Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Southern Direction, with his retinue of three thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat. The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction, with his retinue of seven thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat.\n\nAt that time, the Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction summoned the Northern Mystic Perfected and the jade lads attendant upon the realized, commanding them to attend his seat. In an instant, myriad transformations occurred: the palaces, halls, towers, and pavilions were all adorned with crystal, fluorite, coral, amber, and intricate carvings. Golden qilin and lions were arrayed throughout the seats.\n\nThe Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction first paid homage to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the Eastern Direction, then to the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Southern Direction, and next to the Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction. Each took their seats and discoursed upon the records of the living and dead, male and female, of the Lower Realm of Fengdu.\n\nSuddenly, the cries of aggrieved souls in the ghostly prisons were heard, their wails of pain ceasing only in death. Then were seen the dead souls, untethered in the dark of the netherworld, unregistered by the ghostly officials.\n\nAt that time, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction, seated to the west, inquired: “What karmic retribution befalls these sinful beings? The dead souls endure torment unbearable.”\n\nThe Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction replied: “The dead souls of the Lower Realm endure torment. For in their former lives, they were unfilial and disloyal, lacking righteousness between ruler and minister, lacking kindness between father and child. They disrespected the Three Luminaries, disbelieved in the principles of the unseen, deceived their teachers, slandered the Dao, rebelled against their kin, wantonly took lives, and indulged in greed and lust. Fengdu strips them of their allotted years, cutting short their lives in middle age. Their dead souls face retribution; their kalpas are exhausted, and there is no deliverance.”\n\nThe Seven Qi Heavenly Lord further asked: “Why are these dead souls untethered, unregistered by the ghostly officials?”\n\nThe Northern Thearch replied: “These beings, in their former lives, indulged in wine and meat, slaughtered without restraint, performed no virtuous deeds, and acted contrary to the Dao. Though their allotted years were not yet spent, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens’ Cavernous Palaces seized upon their transgressions, unleashing plagues and poisons, cutting short their years. They perish by water, fire, bandits, epidemics, blades, and warfare—perils to life. They suffer from official and private disputes, shackles, and obstacles, their endeavors thwarted. Year after year, countless meet such fates.\n\nI possess *The Threefold Wondrous Mantra Canon of Fengdu* and the methods of the Northern Thearch. If one can purify the heart, single-mindedly practice my Dao, uphold the canon, and establish a Sevenfold Primordial Altar with incense and lamps, offering devotion day and night without weariness; if one recites my divine mantras, visualizes the true and contemplates the spirits without distraction—then I shall dispatch the Heavenly Peng divine soldiers, the Red Slayers of the Abyssal Cavern, the guardian spirit-generals, and the Sevenfold Primordial warriors of the Vast Expanse to protect your body. Thus, all illnesses shall disperse, and those you treat shall recover. The impoverished shall gain wealth, the imperiled shall find safety, the lowly shall rise in station, and all seekers shall attain their desires.\n\nFor the living men and women of the Lower Realm afflicted by madness, ghostly possession, or extraordinary anomalies—simply follow my precepts and rituals, wield my divine mantras, pace the celestial stems, and align with the Seven Stars and the Dipper. Employ the mudras with single-minded focus, and the divine soldiers shall descend at once to guard your body.”\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: “If later students of the Dao have not yet perfected their merit, they must rely upon my great seal of Fengdu for subduing and recording ghosts and spirits. Carve it from red jujube wood, five inches long and four inches wide. On a *renchen* day, engrave it in a secluded place in the northern outskirts, unknown to men or dogs. After offering seven cups of wine and seven portions of dried meat as sacrifice, bury it in a *gui* earth. Recite the incantation:\n\n‘The Northern Thearch’s divine seal,\nWorn by the realized spirits,\nThe Three Masters descend,\nFollowing my command.\nPartake of my offerings,\nAnd blessings and longevity shall arrive.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Great Thearch’s oral decree and ordinance.’”\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: “To heal all illnesses, visualize the spirits. First sound the celestial drum three times, then the celestial bell three times. Next, visualize your master of transmission standing to your left and right. Sound the celestial drum nine times, then close your eyes and envision the Northern Ultimate Spirit Lord in the empty void above, wearing a great dark crown and radiant feathered robes, descending to the altar.\n\nNext, visualize the seven stellar spirits, childlike in form, clad in vermilion robes and red headbands, descending to the altar. Then visualize the Great General of the Left, Concealer of the Body, above the second finger. His surname is Tang, given name Hong, style Wenming. His home is in Kuaiji. His body is eighty *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments. He wields a precious sword, leading three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging from your left kidney to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Great General of the Right, Spirit Radiance, above the middle finger. His surname is Ge, given name Yong, style Wendu. His home is in Yuzhang. His body is seventy-two *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments. He wields a jade halberd, leading three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging from your right kidney to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Great General of the Center, Concealer of the True Form, above the fourth finger. His surname is Zhou, given name Wu, style Wengang. His home is in Wu Commandery. His body is ninety-six *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments. He wields a jade willow branch, leading three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging from your heart to stand in attendance before and behind you.”\n\nNext, visualize the Green Dragon General, marked by the *mao* trigram. Crowned with a celestial cap and black headband, clad in blue-green robes, his body stands eighty-two *zhang* tall. He wields a bow and arrows, leading four hundred thousand soldiers, all dressed in blue-green, their feathered garments resplendent. They emerge from your liver to stand in attendance at your left and right.\n\nNext, visualize the White Tiger General, marked by the *you* trigram. Crowned with a celestial cap and black headband, clad in white robes, his body stands thirty-six *zhang* tall. He wields a crossbow, leading four hundred thousand soldiers, all dressed in white, their feathered garments resplendent. They emerge from your lungs to stand in attendance at your left and right.\n\nNext, visualize the Vermilion Bird General, marked by the *wu* trigram. Crowned with a celestial cap and black headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe, his body stands sixty *zhang* tall. He wields a long drum and sounding horn, leading four hundred thousand soldiers, all dressed in vermilion, their feathered garments resplendent. They emerge from your heart to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Dark Warrior General, marked by the *zi* trigram. Crowned with a celestial cap and black headband, clad in black robes, his body stands twenty-five *zhang* tall. He wields bells and drums, leading four hundred thousand soldiers, their feathered garments resplendent. They emerge from your kidneys to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Qilin General at the root of the middle finger. His body stands seventy-two *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and black headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe. He wields the *Kuigang*, leading four hundred thousand soldiers, all dressed in yellow, their feathered garments resplendent. They emerge from your spleen to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Eight Divine and Eight Destructive Generals, the Eight Mountain-Searching Commanders, beginning from the center of the fourth finger. The Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, the Ghost-Capturing Envoys, crowned with celestial caps and red headbands, all clad in red robes, their feathered garments resplendent, emerge from every pore of your body to stand in attendance before and behind you. First form the Double Thunder Mudra, raising the Thunder Lords to your left and right. Then, with both hands, form the Heavenly Peng Seal, summoning the Four-Faced, Eight-Armed Deity.\n\nNext, visualize the Heavenly Peng Great General, his body fifteen *zhang* thousand tall, both hands forming the Dipper Mudra. Clad in dragon-scale armor, girded with the Seven-Star Sword, he commands a host of a hundred million cavalry. Seated upright, visualize your waist, hips, fists, and arms as a Dipper constellation.\n\nThe Seven Radiant Generals of the Vast Abyss, the Divine Marshals, the Thunder Masters, and the Lightning Masters—both hands forming the Thunder Mudra—stop your ears to capture the thunder’s roar. Then, using the Thunder Mudra again, close your eyes to seize the lightning’s glow. Their feathered garments resplendent, each wielding a golden sword, they emerge from your face to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize General Yu Yi in your left eye. Exhale once, his name is Peng Zhi. Visualize General Jie Lin in your right eye. Inhale once, his name is Peng Jiao. Their feathered garments resplendent, illuminating within and without, each leads one hundred twenty thousand soldiers. They emerge from your eyes to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the summoned officials and soldiers. Raise your head and recite the incantation: Exhale once, envisioning the Primordial Heavenly Worthy before you. Exhale once toward yourself, and within the breath appears a perfected person—your own body—known as the Son of the Heavenly Emperor. Shout: “I am the Son of the Heavenly Emperor, sent by the Lord Lao. My head bears the sun and moon, my eyes radiate light. My body is girded with the Northern Dipper, possessing the celestial soldiers of Qian’s numen—hundreds of millions—dwelling within my pores. At my front, a cauldron of boiling oil ten thousand *dan* in size; at my back, axes of yellow gold. I set forth from the Northern Dipper’s path to Mount Tai, where I encountered the Eastern King Father, who taught me the method of slaying demons and bestowed upon me the way to command spirits. I now report to the Northern Emperor, summoning and dispatching officials and soldiers. My head bears the Floral Canopy, the Mountain Character Seal. My feet tread upon the *Kuigang*. To my left, I command the Six Jia; to my right, I employ the Six Ding. What spirit would not submit? What demon would dare oppose? Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!”\n\nThe Northern Emperor declares: “Among those born in the Lower Era who know the names of the Seven Stars, all calamities and illnesses shall vanish at their call, and every evil shall retreat. A myriad wishes shall follow their hearts.” Recite the incantation:\n\n*Zi*: The Star of Greedy Wolf, taboo name Yangming, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Chou* and *Hai*: The Star of Great Gate, taboo name Yinjing, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Yin* and *Xu*: The Star of Emolument Storage, taboo name Zhenren, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Mao* and *You*: The Star of Literary Brilliance, taboo name Xuanming, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Chen* and *Shen*: The Star of Integrity and Chastity, taboo name Danyuan, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Si* and *Wei*: The Star of Martial Brilliance, taboo name Beiji, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n*Wu*: The Star of Breaking Army, taboo name Tianguan, revered spirits in countless numbers, come to aid my body.\n\nShout: “Revered spirits of the Seven Stars, soldiers in the thousands and millions of billions, stand at my left and right! To the left, the Green Dragon, named Meng Zhang, marked by the *mao* trigram. To the right, the White Tiger, named Guardian of Soldiers, marked by the *you* trigram. Ahead, the Vermilion Bird, named Ling Guang, marked by the *wu* trigram. Behind, the Dark Warrior, named Zhi Ming, marked by the *zi* trigram. The Spleen, the Noble Child, enters the Central Palace. Center. Meng Zhang and the Guardian of Soldiers advance ahead; Ling Guang and Zhi Ming follow behind.”\n\nHolding standards and bearing banners, bearing bells and drums, they surround me front and back, left and right, in countless layers. *Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nVisualize the Four Huntsmen positioned to the left, right, front, and rear—then exhale a mouthful of turbid *qi* to the northwest, and inhale a mouthful of pure *qi* from the southeast.\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: Next, visualize treading the *Gang* of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. First tread upon *Tanlang* (Greedy Wolf), then *Jumen* (Great Gate), then *Lucun* (Salary Keeper), then *Wenqu* (Literary Curve), then *Lianzhen* (Upright Integrity), then *Wuqu* (Military Curve), then *Pojun* (Breaking Army).\n\nNext, return from the altar, sheathe the sword, and take your seat. Observe which star the patient belongs to, then inscribe the Seven Stars talisman, have the patient wear it, and swallow it—divine efficacy will manifest at once.\n\n**Talismanic Script of the Divine Seals**\n*Tanlang* Star Lord\n*Jumen* Star Lord\n*Lucun* Star Lord\n*Wenqu* Star Lord\n*Lianzhen* Star Lord\n*Wuqu* Star Lord\n*Pojun* Star Lord\n\nThose born in the *zi* hour belong to it\nThose born in the *chou* or *hai* hours belong to it\nThose born in the *yin* or *xu* hours belong to it\nThose born in the *mao* or *you* hours belong to it\nThose born in the *chen* or *shen* hours belong to it\nThose born in the *wei* hour belong to it\nThose born in the *wu* hour belong to it\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: The Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars talismans—whether for man or woman—if someone is afflicted by manifold demons (*wangliang*), loses their mind, or suffers the departure of the five viscera...\n\nDistension and fullness, alternating chills and fever—swallow this talisman, and divine efficacy will manifest at once. All demonic entities (*baixie*) that behold the talisman shall dissolve into blood.

Above, they repay the nation’s grace; below, they protect the myriad people. Dragon spirits guard and defend, turning foes into kin. Divine immortals govern transformations, and ghosts dare not encroach upon mortals.\n\nThe **Talisman Incantation** states:\n*Zi Wen.*\nNorthern Black Emperor, revered among the ten thousand sages.\nGrand Tenuity’s Six Jia, the Five Qi Spirit Lords.\nRadiant as sun and moon, majestic as heaven and earth.\nFlying talismans seize and execute, sealing the gates of ghosts.\nMarching spirits deploy *qi*, dispelling the Five Afflictions.\nLeft and right officers and soldiers, the Three and Five Generals.\nThunder Lords and lightning bolts, winds whirling in haste.\nBlades fall like rain, ranks arrayed like clouds.\nHands grasp the Emperor’s bell, heads crowned with Kunlun.\nTraversing the world, they capture and subdue ghosts and spirits.\nThe Nine Provinces’ earth gods, blood-offering guests—\nnone may resist.

As the True Talisman of the Most High commands!*\n\nThe **Northern Emperor** declares:\nFor those born in the Lower Yuan—be they man or woman—who receive and uphold my secret method and heal the myriad people, all must purify body and mind, bathe, and fast. Follow the rites to perform the ritual, offering libations to the Seven Primes. Altar stations must be solemn and pristine, with wine, dried meats, five fruits, incense, and lamps. Wear my divine talisman, recite my divine incantation, and focus the mind unwaveringly. Then the Seven Perfected shall descend, spirit generals shall secretly assist, and every wish shall be fulfilled without fail.\n\nIf one receives and upholds this method with an impure heart or insincere devotion, they waste gold and jade in vain, and no divine efficacy shall manifest.\n\nThe **Northern Emperor** declares:\nI dispatch the Six Ding officers and generals to seize and execute ghosts and spirits, driving away demonic fiends. Those born in the Lower Yuan who seek to learn but have not yet attained my supreme Dao must first employ talismans and seals to subdue external demons and cure all illnesses. Summon the officials of the Fengdu Ghost Register to advance their immortal ranks, their names inscribed on jade slips. Beware of recklessly transmitting this to the unworthy, lest the seven generations of ancestors in Fengdu be seized and tormented, and the living have their lifespan stolen.\n\nAt that time, the Four Directional Emperor Lords, hearing the Northern Emperor expound the divine incantations, talismans, seals, and secret methods for subduing demons, praised the Five Numinous Emperor Lords—whose divine power is subtle and wondrous, beyond comprehension. The great assembly paid reverence, the Six Heavens trembled, and the teachings were entrusted to true disciples.\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on the Northern Emperor’s Subduing Demons Divine Incantation, Wondrous Scroll Three, concludes.**\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on the Northern Emperor’s Subduing Demons Divine Incantation, Wondrous Scroll Four: The Chapter on Warding Off Calamities**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden, expounding the Dharma and reciting the precepts to the assembly of heavenly youths. When the discourse concluded, the Most High Dao Lord approached, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\nToday, seated in attendance, I have heard the twenty-four articles of the luminous true precepts, the karmic retribution of good and evil, and my heart rejoices, my mind is liberated, with no lingering obstructions. Moreover, I have been graciously instructed on the karmic connections of sin and fortune, the Dharma of deliverance through purification rites, and the salvation of suffering souls in the long night, ascending to the Hall of Blessings where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. This Dharma is vast and universal; the deceased all rely upon it.\n\nYet, the men and women of this world and the next, who have not encountered the scriptures and precepts, are weak in *qi* and strength, unable to uphold them, and thus lack means to ward off calamities. Many are harmed by worldly malevolent ghosts and demons, their lives cut short, failing to complete their natural lifespan. Since the Heavenly Worthy has opened the transformation of great compassion, benefiting both the living and the dead, the living and the deceased alike bear this grace. I humbly beseech your mercy to further reveal the methods for men and women of future generations to protect their bodies and preserve their lives, that they may escape calamities. In this world, they face the Three Disasters and Nine Adversities, the Five Pestilences and Seven Afflictions, the *qi* of illnesses and epidemics, and the perils of myriad demons and specters. May their lives be preserved, free from harm. If your compassion is moved, I shall reverently receive this sacred grace.\n\nThen, the Heavenly Worthy rejoiced and replied: \"Excellent, excellent! What you have requested is indeed of utmost importance. I now take pity on all beings as parents cherish their children. I shall now speak for you—listen carefully, hold fast to these words in your heart, and never forget my teaching.\"\n\nAt that moment, the assembly of sages rejoiced and, with single-minded devotion, prostrated in reverence.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"In the distant past, the people were simple and honest. They suffered no harm, their lifespans unfolding as destined. They fulfilled their natural years without premature death, and no ghosts inflicted wanton injury. But now, in this degenerate age of shallowness, the human heart is corrupted. The five emotions are in turmoil, giving rise to doubt and confusion. Deeds lack sincerity, and only perverse conduct is pursued. They turn from truth to embrace falsehood, forsaking righteousness and benevolence. They defy Heaven and rebel against Earth, severing roots and felling trunks. They are neither loyal nor filial, devoid of love and compassion. They deceive the multitudes and tyrannize the common folk. They slaughter living beings and destroy the lives of creatures, accumulating boundless transgressions and karmic enmity.\n\nThus, in this present life, calamities arise at every turn. Some are slain by bandits, others destroyed by malevolent ghosts. Some are harmed by venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or the stings of poisonous insects. Official and private disputes arise without cause, leading to imprisonment, flogging, or exile. Families may be struck by pestilence, bodies afflicted by toxic *qi*, great and small illnesses, or the death of kin, severing the six relations.\n\nAll such sufferings arise from the *qi* of the Six Heavens. The King of the Northern Feng, the Eight Divisions of Ghostly Masters, the Generals of the Dead in the human realm, and the Spirits of the Five Weapons roam the world, seizing upon transgressions to unleash their toxic *qi* and slay the wicked. Year after year, month after month, countless suffer these fates, entangled in one another’s doom, leading to death. The surviving people cannot escape such agonies—how grievous and pitiable!\"\n\nHere now is the Northern Emperor’s Fearless Divine Incantation, together with the names of the Six Palaces. Should you place faith in it and recite it with single-minded devotion, you shall surely escape all calamities, remain free of affliction throughout your life, and obtain blessings such as these.\n\nThe incantation reads:\nI am a disciple of the Most High, ruling below over the Six Heavens.\nThe Six Heavenly Palaces are my domain—\nnot only my domain, but the charge of the Most High.\nI know the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces, and thus I attain long life.\nShould any dare transgress, the Most High shall strike them down.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statutes and decrees.\n\nFirst: the Palace of Zhòu-Jué-Yīn.\nSecond: the Palace of Tài-Shā-Liàng-Shì-Zōng.\nThird: the Palace of Míng-Chén-Nài-Fàn-Wǔ-Chéng.\nFourth: the Palace of Tián-Zhào-Zuì-Qì.\nFifth: the Palace of Zōng-Líng-Qī-Fēi.\nSixth: the Palace of Gǎn-Sī-Lián-Wǎn-Lǚ.\n\nThe Northern Emperor declares: He who knows the names of the Fengdu Ghost-Kings and the Six Palaces shall command the submission of all hundred ghosts.\nWhen facing outward, focus your mind and silently invoke them.\nUpon hearing this, demonic spirits shall all dissolve into blood.\n\nFirst face north, lower your voice—do not speak loudly—and recite:\nHū!

They rose to bow in reverence, praising the wondrous efficacy and virtuous power of the Five Numinous arts, their awe-inspiring might of subjugation. \"We have now attained this great Dharma gate,\" they declared. \"We shall diligently apply it in future ages to deliver and protect all beings. Let men and women practice with unwavering devotion, each upholding and reciting it with joyful observance.\"\n\nThe Fourth Scroll of *The Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations*, Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Concludes Here\n\n---\n\nThe Fifth Scroll of *The Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations*, Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy\n**Chapter on Divine Seals**\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"*The Secret Scripture of Fengdu’s Wondrous Incantations* contains the texts for beheading ghosts and the principles for dispatching the myriad spirits. I now teach these to the true disciples of future ages. Those who obtain this method and practice it constantly shall attain the Way of deathlessness. For those who seek to master it swiftly, the method lies in perilous paths, amidst ghostly shrines, or in places of doubt and difficulty. First, press the tongue against the palate, spit three times toward the source, and with the left hand pinch the area beneath the nostrils—thirty-six times at the inner boundary of the diaphragm—pressing firmly without lifting the fingers. Once the count is complete, knock the teeth seven times, advance the hands to cover the nose, and with eyes slightly closed, softly recite the incantation:\n\n*Fire Bell Seal, flick toward noon.*\nThe Vermilion Bird’s radiance, divine might surges within.\nThe Four Mountain Sources stand guard—ghostly soldiers flee in terror.\nThe divine pool exhales qi, evil roots hide in submission.\nThe Four Luminaries of the Soul Terrace, jade doors chime like jasper.\nThe Jade Perfected stands majestic, enthroned in the Hall of Light.\nHands wielding purple auroras, head crowned with divine radiance.\nReciting the *Cavern Scripture*’s thirty-nine chapters,\nWithin them, demon-expelling rites—Dragon and Tiger slaying *gang*.\nFierce beasts and charging oxen, bearing blades and swallowing metal.\nUprooting mountains, cleaving the heavens, poisonous dragons and divine raptors.\nSix jaws spewing fire, devouring the King of Ghosts.\nThe Lightning Boar, the Thunder Father, seizing stars in their flight.\nThe screech of the *xiao* bird, the clamor of the *kebo*.\nScorching, they advance against the wind.\nThe Heavenly Net Formation, all arrayed at my side.\nSpouting fire a thousand *zhang* to dispel inauspiciousness.\nThe host of spirits open the path, sealing off mountain villages.\nA thousand spirits, ten thousand numina, all bow with hands clasped to their foreheads.\nThe Marsh Constable bears the censer, burning incense for me.\nWherever I go, the myriad spirits welcome me.\nHeavenly beasts come to guard, a thousand spirits tremble in submission—\nDo not disturb my qi!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as in statutes and decrees.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"This incantation is called the *Great Fire Bell Incantation of the Southern Direction*. In places of disaster, illness, or terror, simply visualize my form and that of the Heavenly Vanguard Marshal. Focus your mind single-pointedly and recite this divine incantation once. Naturally, your hun and po will return to the body, the myriad evils will be subdued, and all malevolence will vanish. Should any land be plagued by the rise of warfare on all four fronts, harming the myriad people, and you seek deliverance, simply establish a Seven Primes Altar at the northern gate of the country. Follow the proper times to perform the Dao, light lamps, burn incense, and recite this incantation. The Heavenly Vanguard Marshal will descend, advancing against the wind. The Southern Fire Pool will exhale qi a thousand *zhang* to dispel inauspiciousness. Warfare will cease, banditry will vanish, misfortune will turn to fortune, and treachery will not arise. Three hundred thousand soldiers, their might augmented by fire bells.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"My Fengdu Divine Seals—twelve in all—possess numinous efficacy and wondrous transformations, their powers boundless. They can subdue and command the myriad spirits, expel evil and banish demons, capture ghosts and cure illnesses, pacify nations and secure households. Practice in accordance with the method, and no disaster will remain. When merit is complete and the Dao perfected, the body will traverse water and fire. Roaming freely, attaining longevity is within reach. Carve them from the heartwood of red jujube, inscribe the characters according to the ritual codes, and arrange them for offerings without fail. On days of calamity, practice with single-minded devotion. Above, they dissolve heavenly disasters; below, they disperse earthly misfortunes. Healing illnesses and curing diseases, all shall attain divine efficacy.\"\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s First Ghost-Slaying Seal**\nCarved from thunderbolt wood, three *cun* long and two *cun* and one *fen* wide. It cures all epidemics. Jujube or cypress wood may also be used.\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Ghost-Summoning Seal**\nCarved from the heartwood of red jujube. It cures all epidemic diseases. When stamped upon the afflicted, they shall surely recover.\n\n**The Heavenly Emperor’s Divine Incantation**\nSubdues evil and subdues demons, bringing good fortune and prosperity.\n\n**The Heavenly Soldier’s Illness-Curing Seal**\nCarrying it brings great auspiciousness.\n\n**Seal to Be Carried on the Person**\nProlongs life, benefits the household, and brings good fortune to the family.\n\n**The Heavenly Vanguard Seal**\nCures all ailments caused by dog ghosts, compelling the afflicted to confess. When merit is complete and the Dao attained, one ascends to heaven bearing the seal. Three *cun* long and three *cun* and one *fen* wide.\n\n**The Sovereign’s Seal**\n\nCarrying it causes noble persons to gather at one’s residence, bringing great fortune and prosperity.\n\n**The Supreme Tenuity Sovereign’s Seal**\nCarrying it commands awe and reverence. It summons and subdues all spirit deities without fail.\n\nAll the above seals should be carved on an auspicious day.\n\n**The Northern Prison Envoy’s Seal**\nCarried or swallowed, it dispels all epilepsy, convulsions, and the hundred diseases. Worn on the right elbow, it brings good fortune.\n\n**The Great General’s Seal**\nCarried, it subdues mighty armies and ensures victory in every battle. It should be worn on the right upper arm.\n\n**The Valiant Warrior’s Divine Jade Seal**\nVersatile in use; first inscribe the invocation, then stamp it, and carry it for good fortune.\n\n**The Supreme Tenuity Sovereign’s Seal**\nCarried, it ensures respect and harmony with noble persons. One *cun* and two *fen* in length, to be carved on a day of hexagram *Liù Hé*.\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: The preceding divine seals dispel the Three Calamities, secure the Three Luminaries, benefit the myriad families, remove misfortune and disaster, and expel all inauspiciousness. If one cultivates with sincere devotion, the true Dao shall manifest at once. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: My Mysterious Capital’s Great Divine Seal is distributed throughout the Six Directions, rescuing from disaster, resolving adversity, curing illness, and dispelling demons. May all true disciples guard it well and not show it to the unworthy.\n\n**Incantation for Activating the Seal:**\n*Wǔ wén.*\nSupreme divine numen, essence of the Flame Emperor.\nRosy light flashes like lightning, streaming radiance through the Three Clarities.\nFire flows for ten thousand *li*, no ghost escapes its form.\nWith one impression of the divine seal, evil spirits are reduced to ashes.\nThe Generals of Three and Five, the *Huōluò* officers and soldiers,\nLevel heaven and strike earth, ceaselessly slaying ghosts.\nFlying talismans and swift seals, bearing the Five Stars upon their heads,\nHurl fire to slay in advance, vanquishing ten thousand ghosts and a thousand spirits.\nThe demonic thieves of the Six Heavens are delivered to the Divine Soldiers.\nThe Five Numinous True Elders are my Celestial Masters.\nUnobstructed divine power, all spirits return in unity.\nEvil ghosts utterly destroyed, inauspicious ones pursued.\nThe Nine Paths of the Central Yellow spread might in all directions,\nSubduing and concealing old *qi*, leaving not the slightest trace.\nThe Five Pestilences and Seven Afflictions—I can slay them all.\nWhat spirit dares resist? What spirit dares spy?\nTheir forms are executed in Fengdu, their corpses severed by the Northern Dipper.\nWith one stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts dissolve into mist.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Supreme Five Numinous Five *Qi* Northern Dark Emperor’s Numinous Lord.\n\n**Another Incantation:**\nThe Great Dao has a spirit, named the Heavenly Soldier.\nServing the Nine Heavens, attending the Three Clarities,\nIt roams the world below, capturing and pursuing demonic spirits.\nWhen the Divine King is enraged, the Five Peaks crumble.\nThe eastern hordes of demons, the *Huōluò* ghostly soldiers,\nThousands upon thousands beheaded, ten thousand upon ten thousand their forms destroyed.\nDare they test the nether courts of Fengdu? The northern capital’s defenses stand firm.\nThe fiercest are executed, the virtuous find peace.\nThe sunken souls of the Six Heavens, each is recorded by name.\nThose who defy the Dao die; those who follow it live.\nFlying and roaming calamities, dare they alter the hidden and obscure?\nGhosts and demons are swept away, the human realm finds tranquility.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Northern Emperor’s Numinous Lord, commanding the seal to slay ghosts, as per the statutes and ordinances.\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: These divine incantations and seals are the secrets of the Northern Mystery, revered by the highest sages. I instruct all future true disciples to receive and uphold them with utmost sincerity. Establish my image, make offerings, and pay homage with unwavering diligence.\n\nEach year, on the three days when the Dragon moves, the five days when the Horse halts, the seven days when the Pheasant flies, the nine days when the Dog establishes, and on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, perform the jiao rites with reverence, focusing the mind without distraction. Each morning, purify the heart and recite the divine incantations ten thousand times. Thus may merit be accomplished and responses manifest without delay.\n\nInstruct all future true disciples: if dwelling in the secular world, conduct the incense offerings and devotions in a subdued voice, avoiding loud recitation lest the gods and spirits be startled. Shun the polluting qi of birth and death. Whenever handling the scripture, first lift the prohibitions.\n\nThis Fengdu Divine Seal is the Dao of longevity and deathlessness. Thus it is placed within the Twelve Diagrams of the Lower Primordial’s Realm of Life, to suppress the baleful qi of the twelve years, months, and days, and to subdue the calamities of the twelve hours. If a nation practices this, the realm will know peace, all directions will submit, and the barbarians of the eight wilds will return to virtue. Should a land suffer disasters, incessant slaughter, or the sorrows of ruler and ministers, establish the Altar of the Seven Primordials, swiftly forge the seal, and hang it at the twelve earthly branches of the nation’s borders, within its astrological divisions. Morning and evening, burn incense and make offerings. The Perfected of the North will descend, and the divine seal’s transcendent immortals will transform into mighty deities—or fierce generals—to aid the state, dispelling the three disasters, averting punishments, halting warfare, and securing the land’s tranquility. Ruler and ministers will share prosperity, the myriad people will enjoy purity and fortune—all through the power of the divine seal.\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: If those born in the Lower Primordial cultivate this Dao of mine yet fail to witness its statutes, behold its scriptures, or prepare its talismans and seals, their hand gestures lack method, their recitations bear no merit, and they claim it yields no effect. They know not the wondrous Dao of immortals, for the matter lies in diligent cultivation. Daily progress in practice allows the gods and spirits to become familiar and mindful. Past transgressions are swept away, karmic offenses pardoned. The three obstacles gradually dissolve, the six senses become unobstructed. Above, one communes with numinous wisdom; below, one governs human relations. Summon, and they come at once—divine soldiers stand guard. Unceasing jiao rites ensure the Highest Sages take daily notice. Heal illnesses, dispel demons, and responses will follow the heart’s intent. Merit accomplished, the fruit of the Dao attained, one enters the realm of non-action.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor bestowed the divine incantations and seals upon the thirty myriad Mighty Divine Kings and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct. All the ghosts and spirits of the great earth, upon hearing this, universally submit. Those afflicted by stagnation and illness find relief; wronged souls achieve liberation.\n\nWhat is this scripture called? The Northern Emperor says: It is named *The Wondrous Scripture of the Fengdu Divine Seal of the Great Emperor*, harmonizing Heaven and pacifying Earth, delivering from the calamities of the Nine Yangs, prolonging life and aiding the imperiled. Let each receive and uphold it, and all true disciples practice it with devotion.\n\nThus concludes *The Fifth Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations*, spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Venerable.\n\n---\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Venerable*\nAlso named: *The Most High Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and Golden Register for Delivering Lives and Rescuing from the Nine Hells*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable was in the Wondrous Realm of the Nine Purities, within the Three Primordials Palace, seated upon a jeweled cloud and jade throne beneath the canopy of the Qianlin trees. Together with the Great Sages—the Most High Dao Lords, the Most High Lord Lao, the Nine August Perfected, the Flying Heavenly Great Sages, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the hosts of heavenly dragons, humans, and ghosts, an innumerable assembly—all gathered at once upon the jeweled terrace of kalpas. The multitudes from the ten directions arrived, riding five-colored jade wheels, eight-scene jasper chariots, dark numinous jade staves, flying cloud white canopies, unicorn-drawn feathered carriages, dragon banners and phoenix plumes, lions and white cranes. Their roars and songs resounded harmoniously as they burned incense, scattered flowers, soared through the void, and chanted the cavernous hymns, praising the Heavenly Venerable and collectively reviewing the registers to deliver all from suffering.\n\nThen, the Upper Palace of the Three Primordials radiated luminous brilliance, illuminating the vast emptiness. The Numinous Capital of the Purple Tenuity shone, casting its glow across the ten directions. Below, even the boundless realms and the eternal night of the Nine Hells of the netherworld were revealed. The roots of good and evil destinies gleamed within the light, and every mysterious office was illuminated. In every heavenly palace, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable and the great assembly were seen expounding the wondrous Dao, transforming humans and gods, marking meritorious deeds, and inscribing names in the Yellow Registers, golden tablets, and jade slips, arrayed before the Three Clarities.\n\nWithin each hell, the Ten Directions’ Savior Heavenly Venerables were seen entering the Nine Hells to deliver all from suffering. They commanded the Northern Emperor, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the hundred-twenty departments, the Five Emperor Examiners, the Life-Inspecting Lads, the Recorders of Life and Deeds, the Controllers of Merit and Execution, the Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign, the Four Luminous Lords and their retinues, the officials of the Five Peaks, the divine soldiers enforcing punishments, the mighty heavenly warriors, the heavenly couriers and armored troops, the Ox-Head jailers, the Mighty Sword Divine Kings, the great demons of the Three Realms, and the nine hundred million ghost kings—all gathered in the Nine Hells of the netherworld to receive the teachings and precepts.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu and all the ghost officials trembled in awe, each thinking: \"We have accumulated sins and become ghost officials, governing the netherworld, dwelling in darkness for kalpas without end, never beholding light. What karmic cause brings us today to suddenly witness the august radiance of the Highest Sages illuminating the profound gloom? We wish to inquire but hesitate in doubt.\"\n\nAt that time, within the prisons of universal torment, all the sinners whose names were inscribed in the Black Registers were driven by the Ox-Head jailers onto the Mountain of Knives. Their heads and bodies were shattered, their limbs scattered. Yet among them, one man alone ascended and descended the mountain, following the trees’ heights, treading upon blades and edges without a single wound. All the swords and halberds transformed into lotus flowers.\n\nThen, the Northern Emperor was greatly alarmed. He bowed his head in reverence and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"Your disciple, by past karma, was unfortunate to assume office in the netherworld, dwelling in Fengdu for kalpas uncounted. I have repeatedly witnessed sinners enduring myriad torments. I have also seen the Eastern Prison of Wind and Thunder, where black winds, crashing thunder, and lightning bolts hurl flying spears and drifting halberds, piercing sinners’ bodies, scattering their limbs, and rending their viscera. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day or night.\"\n\nMoreover, he beheld the Southern Prison of Blazing Obscurity, where multitudes of sinners swallowed fire and devoured coals, scorched by flames. Their faces and heads were charred, fire-mountains crowned their skulls, and from their skin, bones, and flesh, flames erupted joint by joint. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe further witnessed the Western Prison of Diamond, where sinners endured countless beatings with iron hammers and metal rods. Their limbs rotted and disintegrated, their sinews and bones scattered. Iron forks pierced their bellies, and golden hammers lodged in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without pause, day or night.\n\nHe also saw the Northern Prison of Freezing Cold, where sinners sank into pools of frigid mire. Ice-spears and frost-blades severed their sinews and bones, while vats of venomous brew were poured upon them. Their bodies fell apart, their hearts and viscera ruptured. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nThen he observed the Central Prison of Universal Torment, where sinners endured unbearable agony under relentless torture. Their sinews snapped, blood flowed, and they collapsed in swoons. Thereupon, the wardens impaled them with iron forks, compelling them to ascend the mountains of blades and forests of swords. Black winds from all directions swayed the trees, causing their feet to slip onto the knife-mountains and their bodies to hang upon the sword-edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without cease, day or night.\n\nHe further beheld the Southeastern Prison of Bronze Pillars, where sinners embraced and climbed the pillars, their outer and inner flesh scorched and rotted. Their sinews and bones fell apart, their backs and bellies festered with pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe also saw the Southwestern Prison of Butchery, where sinners were suspended upside down while blades carved their bodies. Their limbs, sinews, skin, and viscera were all sliced by knives, blood pooling upon the ground in unbearable torment. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without pause, day or night.\n\nMoreover, he witnessed the Northwestern Prison of Fire Chariots, where sinners were torn asunder by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some were cast amid the fire chariots, each wheel lined with blades that, as they turned, sliced their bodies. Fierce flames roasted them to charred ruin. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe further beheld the Northeastern Prison of Boiling Cauldrons, where sinners were impaled by iron forks and plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid. Their bodies were steeped and cooked, their limbs dissolved into pus and blood, the stench unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without cease, day or night.\n\nThe Northern Emperor then inquired: \"By what karmic cause does this one sinner alone ascend and descend the mountains of blades and forests of swords unscathed, the spears and halberds transforming into lotus flowers? His countenance is majestic, his steps fearless, and though myriad torments assail him, none can harm him.\"\n\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Venerable turned his chariot, and the Perfected Ones descended in assembly. All trembled in awe, uncertain of what was to come.\n\nThe Northern Emperor entreated: \"May the Heavenly Venerable, in his great compassion and mercy, universally save and deliver all beings suffering in the Nine Dark Realms. May their sins be eradicated, their past lives recalled, and may they forsake evil to embrace goodness. May they escape the Nine Dark Realms, dwell in radiance, and through the wheel of blessed retribution, attain lasting liberation, forever departing the Three Wretched Paths.\"\n\nAt that moment, the multitudes of the Nine Dark Hells, hearing the Northern Emperor’s earnest plea, awakened to remorse and yearned for absolution. Their cries of sorrow resounded, shaking the Brahma-heavens.\n\nThen, the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, moved by boundless compassion, surveyed all with their salvific light. Through the power of the Six Penetrations, they bade the sinners close their eyes and meditate in stillness. In an instant, each recalled their past lives and understood their deeds.\n\nIn their former existences, they had committed myriad evils:\nSome had murdered their lords or fathers, or been unfilial to their parents.\nSome had slandered the Great Dao, turning from truth to falsehood.\nSome had harmed their brothers or plotted against their masters.\nSome, with their kin, had committed incest.\nSome had been bandits, taking lives.\nSome had slaughtered beings to indulge their own flesh.\nSome had oppressed the weak with strength or abused the lowly with power.\nSome had feigned devotion to the Three Treasures while their hearts wavered.\nSome had disdained Dharma-teachers or defiled sacred scriptures.\nSome had harbored malice, cruelty, or jealousy.\nSome had wielded vicious tongues, sowing discord among the virtuous.\nSome had killed living beings in licentious rites or exposed the Three Luminaries to shame.\nWhether by thought, word, or deed—whether self-committed or taught to others—\nall sins accumulated over kalpas were suddenly realized, each clearly understood.\n\nTheir sorrow redoubled, and they yearned for liberation.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable addressed the four assemblies: \"Listen well. These sinners, for countless kalpas, have disbelieved the scriptures and teachings, persisting only in evil. Sin upon sin has bound them, their transgressions complete and their fates sealed. Thus, their names were inscribed in the Black Register, their bodies cast into the Nine Dark Realms, sunk in the Three Wretched Paths, with no hope of deliverance.\n\nYet among them was this one who, in life, had established the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, upheld the Golden Register and White Petitions, and observed the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts. His name was inscribed in the Golden Ledger and recorded in the Jade Clarity. His virtue was profound, his merit lofty, and his name known in the Upper Realms. By my divine power, I have responded to his prayers and protected him.\n\nNow, I shall proclaim the prohibitions and sever all roots of evil, that all of you may be liberated at once.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Northern Emperor, having heard these words, was overjoyed in his heart, his delight beyond measure. Leaping with reverence, he gazed upon the Venerable One’s countenance and offered this hymn of praise:\n\n*\"Excellent indeed, Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,\nCompassionate Father and Mother of all beings.\nFrom the Purple Tenuity Palace, Your radiance pours forth,\nBending to illumine the gates of the Nine Dark Realms.\nMajestic and towering, the Frigid Courts of the Netherworld,\nYour reflected light expands across the frozen shores.\nIn the raging flames of the infernal pits,\nA torrential Dharma-rain descends in abundance.\nBoundless is Your great wisdom of universal compassion,\nEver skillful in delivering beings from suffering.\nYou rescue the souls lost in eternal night—\nNow they bow in homage before You.\"*\n\nWhen the Northern Emperor had finished this hymn, the entire assembly joined in unison, exclaiming its excellence. Celestial musicians of the Highest Heaven performed in myriad harmonies. Banners and canopies, incense and flowers, cast their shade and fragrance over all.\n\nThen the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning addressed the four assemblies once more: *\"Listen carefully, all of you, and still your minds in contemplation. I shall now reveal to you the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the merit of upholding the Golden Register and White Petitions, the deliverance from calamity and salvation from suffering—divine powers beyond comprehension.\"*\n\nThe assembled spirits bowed their heads in reverence, prostrating themselves to receive the sacred command. The Heavenly Venerable One declared:\n\nFirst, uphold reverence and deference, honoring and nurturing father and mother.\nSecond, cultivate diligence, remaining loyal to lord and sovereign.\nThird, refrain from killing, showing compassion to save all beings.\nFourth, refrain from licentiousness, rectifying the body in its conduct among things.\nFifth, refrain from theft, extending righteousness and diminishing the self.\nSixth, refrain from wrath, forsaking violence and aggression toward others.\nSeventh, refrain from deceit, abandoning flattery and harm to the virtuous.\nEighth, refrain from arrogance, casting aside contempt for the Perfected Truth.\nNinth, refrain from duality, maintaining single-minded devotion to the precepts.\nThese are the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts.\n\nThe Yellow Register and White Petitions: True Talisman for Salvation from Suffering\nBy the command of the Primordial Beginning, the Yellow Register and White Petitions—True Talisman for Salvation from Suffering—are proclaimed to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the Nine Dark Hells, the Mighty Heavenly Enforcers, the Divine Soldiers of Punishment, the Recorders of Shared Fate, the Officers of Merit and Execution, the Ox-Headed Wardens, the Great Demons of the Three Realms. May the departed soul of [Name] be delivered, rising from the underworld, forever parting from eternal night, beholding the light, all sins dissolved, all grievances resolved and released.\nBy the merit of upholding these Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, may they ascend to the Heavenly Halls.\nThus is the command proclaimed.\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, at the ___ hour, proclaimed at the fasting altar.\n\nThe Golden Register and White Petitions: Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit\nBy the command of the Primordial Beginning, the Golden Register and White Petitions—Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit—are proclaimed to the Lunar Heaven of the Southern Realm, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Great Lord of Longevity, the Venerable Han and Sima, the Lords of Destiny and Record, the Divine Lords of Life Extension, Fortune Augmentation, and Deliverance from Calamity, the Great Spirits of Resurrection and Death-Monitoring. May the departed soul of [Name] ascend to the Vermilion Numinous Flowing Fire Court, where jade eyes refine the form, yellow blossoms purify the body, the name is inscribed in purple cinnabar, and transformation grants rebirth.\nBy the merit of this Golden Register, may their destiny be delivered, ascending at this very moment.\nThus is the command proclaimed.\n\nOn the [Year] [Month] [Day] at the [Hour], the altar of the fast proclaims:\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate declares: Those who cultivate the Great Cavern Dao of the Supreme Perfected and the essentials of the Three Perfected, yet do not know the True Form of Mount Fengdu, shall not have their seven ancestors purged from the Womb Gate. This is also called the *Six Heavens’ Strategic Text*. Inscribe the deceased’s name in cinnabar and black ink beside it, then refine it in searing flames—thus shall this realm loose its bonds, the Three Offices pardon transgressions, and the soul ascend to the Hall of Blessings. Carve it in stone and erect it at the tomb palace, and suffering souls shall receive deliverance, their names recorded in the Vermilion Numinous Court. Let scholars wear it upon their person or place it above the hall’s chambers, and ten thousand ghosts shall vanish without trace, while the hidden springs of darkness open to prosperity.\n\nThis text is inscribed at the Northern Gate of Supreme Clarity, governing the division of the Six Swords, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Primordial Six Heavens’ Subjugation of Demons*.\n\nIts eulogy says:\nThe True Form of Fengdu,\nText of Supreme Clarity.\nCultivating immortals,\nWear it to subdue demonic essence.\nThe Three Offices bestow blessings,\nSeven ancestors receive rebirth.\nBlack ledgers erased,\nRefined and delivered to the Vermilion Numinous Court.\nMight and spirit silently guard,\nAttaining the Dao’s fulfillment.\nThe *Six Heavens’ Strategic Text*,\nSecures the home and brings prosperity.\n\nThe *Sweet Dew Communion with Perfection Incantation* says:\nVirtue’s golden radiance,\nGently opens the gates of darkness.\nThe Flower Pool flows with true fragrance,\nLotus canopies drift upon the clouds.\nA thousand spirits harmonize primordial unity,\nEver dwelling in the Twelve Towers.\nHasten to proclaim the Lingbao decree,\nAnd wander freely in the celestial halls.\n\nThis is called the *Divine Incantation Breaking Hell’s Bonds and Communing with Perfection*, a secret and wondrous utterance proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Most High. If one recites it, the gates of hell shall open, locks shall fall away of themselves, the Nine Dark Realms shall cease their trials, and the Six Paths shall halt their turning. Suffering souls shall receive rebirth, and forebears shall ascend in deliverance.\n\nThe *Incantation Purifying Fengdu’s Hell and Ascending to Heaven* says:\nVast and boundless, within Fengdu,\nLayer upon layer, the Vajra Mountains stand.\nThe boundless radiance of Lingbao,\nIllumines the scorching pools of affliction.\nThe seven ancestors and all hidden souls,\nTheir forms follow the fragrant cloud-banners.\nWith the blue lotus of concentration and wisdom,\nThey ascend to the divine, forever at peace.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declares: If the imprisoned souls of hell hear even the name of this divine incantation, they shall naturally rejoice and attain the path to heaven. These two divine incantations are from the *Sweet Dew Divine Incantations Scripture of Ascending from Hell to Heaven*.\n\n**The True Form of Mount Fengdu**\nIf you receive and uphold the Golden Register, the White Petition, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit, and the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering, you shall dissolve the great sins of the Nine Dark Realms and inscribe your name in the Nine Palaces. The Youth Who Surveys Destiny shall guard the precepts, the Mighty Spirits and the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the clerks of the Six Palaces shall follow the petition’s text, sheltering and protecting the disciples who receive the precepts.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy further declares: If in any land war ceases not and pestilence spreads, let its ruler, queen, crown prince, nobles, and all common people establish the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, each receiving the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and the Golden Register’s sacred talismans. War shall quiet, malevolent forces shall withdraw, heaven and humanity shall rejoice, and the land shall know great peace.\n\nIf in mountains or wilds you are beset by tigers, wolves, or fierce beasts, calm your heart and visualize the Golden Petition’s talisman, the Youth Who Surveys Destiny, the Precept Master, and the Dharma-Protecting Divine Kings. The beasts shall retreat of themselves and never harm you.\n\nIf upon the great sea you encounter fierce winds, visualize the stilling of waves and storms, and you shall reach the shore.\n\nIf amid the blades of battle you stand, visualize weapons vanishing, and you shall suffer no harm.\n\nIf imprisoned in shackles and bonds, visualize your grievances redressed, and you shall surely be freed.\n\nIf afflicted by demonic spirits or manifold sufferings, visualize malevolent ghosts vanishing, and you shall naturally recover.\n\nIf one has passed away and is bound for the Nine Dark Realms, their name inscribed in the Black Ledger, let their spouse, children, disciples, and fellow students establish the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, inscribe their name on a White Petition, receive the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, and burn away the Black Ledger. Those sinful souls shall be instantly released, ascend through the Celestial Gate, and through the turning of karmic conditions, become Perfected of the Nine Palaces.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy further declares: The wondrous precepts of the Golden Register and the Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit bear the weightiest of prohibitions. If cultivated in accordance with the method, their blessings shall be boundless. Yet if one harbors doubt and slander, fostering thoughts of contempt, know that such a person accumulates evil across ten thousand kalpas, their sins profound and heavy, their name inscribed in the Black Ledger, their body consigned to the demonic officials. After death, they shall inevitably sink into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu, enduring every torment through endless nights, never to be freed.\n\nShould one initially believe and receive, only to later regret, the Youth Who Surveys Destiny shall report to the Three Offices, erase their name from the Golden Petition, and inscribe it in the Ledger of Death. In this life, they may suffer malignant diseases—worms, leprosy, ulcers, and abscesses—abandoned by all, unable to live yet unable to die, tormented by their own anguish, with no escape. Or they may long endure misfortune: falling victim to violence, violating the king’s law, perishing by blade or beast, drowning in water or burning in fire, cursed by evil tongues, discord in the household, strife at the gate, or entanglement with enemies. Once having lost the true Dao, they shall forever sink into evil destinies.\n\nTherefore, follow the regulations and uphold them without deviant thoughts. Proclaim this to all men and women, that all may hear and know.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor and all the four assemblies, along with the sinful souls of the Nine Dark Realms, hearing these words, their spirits awakened and minds enlightened, each aroused good intentions. Their manifold sufferings dissolved, their bodies and minds at peace, they turned their backs on the cycles of rebirth and forever embraced the Dao.\n\nAt that moment, the Black Ledgers of the Nine Dark Realms were all consumed in flames. The flames of Fire Mountain subsided, the waves of the Water Prison stilled. Those who swallowed fire and ate coals were transformed into sweet dew. Golden hammers and iron staves became lotus blossoms. Walking upon the void, they chanted in praise:\n\nWe bow our heads to the Supreme Dao,\nOur hearts return to the Primordial Worthy.\n\nThe Most Perfect and Wondrous Lord,\nOpens the Flying Mystery Gate.\nWith subtle precepts, awakens the Five Spirits;\nGolden scriptures admonish the myriad gods.\nInspecting the Registers of Life and Fate,\nDivine talismans deliver suffering souls.\nRiding clouds to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nIn harmony with those of the Mystic Realm.\n\nThe Sixth Scroll of *The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons* concludes.\n\nThe Seventh Scroll of *The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*\n**The Chapter of the Nine Dragons**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy was seated upon the Nine Dragons Throne within the Purple Tenuity Palace. It was the fifteenth day of the month of Everlasting Spring, when the bright star shone resplendent. Before him, the various Heavenly Emperors, the Eight Mighty Spirit Kings, the multitudes of earthly spirits, immortal men and women, divine men and women, the immortals of the Nine Palaces, and the hosts of flying immortals all prostrated themselves, kneeling in reverence to gaze upon his sacred countenance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy remained silent, uttering not a word. Closing his eyes in tranquil contemplation, he reflected upon the boundless beings of the ten directions, mired in ignorance and darkness, unaware of the true and correct Dao. They commit manifold evil deeds, drowning in the river of birth and death, drifting through the Five Paths. Oppressed by extreme suffering, who among them can awaken to the truth? Only I know.\n\nHaving thus pondered, he once more clicked his teeth. Unbeknownst to him, the Northern Emperor, sensing the power of the Dao, perceived his thoughts. From the summit of the Dark Mound in the north, he arrived with his divine retinue, riding the void, and approached the Heavenly Worthy. With utmost reverence, he bowed and addressed him, saying: \"Most Sagely One, your compassionate transformation pities the suffering of heaven and humanity, enduring calamities and hardships. You broadly extend salvation. The heavens rejoice, auspicious clouds arise. The hells are freed from grievances, and the heavens bear the joy of renewed life. Demons and malevolent spirits are banished, the Six Caves sealed. The children of heaven and earth universally receive profound grace. Yet you also reflect upon those oppressed by poverty and hardship, afflicted by hunger, cold, sorrow, and grief. We do not know, Most Sagely One, by what means you will save and deliver them. If you deign to grant succor, the heavens will be ever grateful.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"What you now request is that in heaven and earth, the poor and rich may be made equal, without distinction. I shall now expound this for you. The establishment of heaven and earth arises from non-action. The coalescence of qi and the condensation of the void are the result of my teachings. The length of one’s predestined life and the causes of attaining the Dao—those whose names are inscribed in the Registers of the Upper Birth proceed to the Palace of Southern Prosperity. Those who seek to avert disasters and attain honor and emolument turn to the Northern Dipper. Those pursued by the ledgers belong to the offices of the Three Officials. Those who obtain wealth and treasures must seek the Nine Saints and Five Dragons. I shall now expound this; may each of you receive and uphold it.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Within the Four Heavens, there are the wondrous names of the Nine Dragons. They bestow blessings upon official emoluments, ensure the fertility of the land, prevent disasters, grant the fulfillment of prayers, and ward off all depletion, bringing daily prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Dragons leave no trace, for they arise through the Dao. As the majestic spirits of the Heavenly Emperor, they guard the stipends of the world’s people—this is their trust. I now proclaim to the great assembly: If a land suffers calamities, its five grains do not flourish, and its people endure poverty, hardship, and insufficient clothing and food; if its officials stagnate in rank, their worries unending, and all their desires unfulfilled, their reputations and careers unprosperous—those who seek benefit should first establish my image, set up the altars of the Three Officials, and construct the platform of the Nine Dragons. At dawn, noon, and dusk, they should burn incense and perform the Daoist rites. By reverently reciting the names of the Nine Dragons and summoning the Dragon Kings of the Five Directions, concentrating their thoughts upon the Northern Culmen, the celestial talismans will descend, and the Dragon Kings will arrive. Receiving their sincere devotion, the Dragon Kings will command the spirits of the Five Lands to widely bestow benefits, dispatching the treasures of the Five Directions to descend upon the realm. The land will flourish abundantly, and all wishes will be fulfilled. Those of utmost sincerity will immediately receive their blessings.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: The Azure Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the East—Horn and Neck—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the Azure Flower Palace, it transforms into the Auspicious Cultivation Dragon King and the Deep Forest Dragon King, presiding over the azure treasures and the various subterranean riches, guarding the azure robes and official emoluments of the world. If one in the world finds their aspirations unfulfilled, suffering poverty and fleeing calamity, they should establish an altar, burn incense, depict the dragon’s form, and prostrate in worship. Reciting the scripture for three days and nights, or seven days and nights, maintaining purity and invoking the dragon, they can summon the azure treasures of the Infinite World of the East and the azure robes and official emoluments into their body. This will dispel the calamities of the Eastern Wood Star, the misfortunes of violent disasters, and the True Official of the Year Star will inscribe their name in the registers, bringing wealth and nobility.\n\nThe Vermilion Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the South—Well and Ghost—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the Palace of Longevity, it transforms into the Many Virtues Dragon King and the Flower Remaining Dragon King, presiding over the vermilion treasures and the various subterranean riches, guarding the vermilion robes and official emoluments of the world. If one in the world encounters misfortunes, their official rank stagnant and the seven treasures ungathered, they should establish an altar, burn incense, make offerings, and prostrate in worship to seek their wishes. This will summon the vermilion treasures of the Infinite World of the South and the vermilion robes and official emoluments into their body, dispelling fire disasters and the sorrows of slander. They will enjoy peace in this life and their blessings will flourish.\n\nThe White Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the West—Straddler and Stomach—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the White Cloud Palace, it transforms into the Sweet Grace Dragon King and the Virtuous Serenity Dragon King, presiding over the white treasures and bestowing the white robes and official emoluments of the world, governing the seven subterranean treasures. If one in the world finds their aspirations unfulfilled, their reputation and career unrealized, and both public and private affairs obstructed, they should establish an altar, burn incense, offer water, prostrate in worship, and make invocations. This will summon the white treasures of the Infinite World of the West and the white robes and official emoluments to descend into their body, dispelling the misfortunes of depletion and curses, widely benefiting the land, ensuring abundant harvests of the five grains, and bringing peace to the mind and spirit. Both public and private affairs will prosper, and blessings and emoluments will be renewed.\n\nThe Black Dragon is the essence of the northern seven lodges, Dipper and Ox, descending to the human realm to protect and sustain the land. Within the Palace of Great Yin, it transforms into the Dragon Kings Poliu and Sidu, presiding over the black treasures and bestowing the black robes and official emoluments of the world, governing the ways of ships and vessels. If one in the world finds their aspirations thwarted and their long-held wishes unfulfilled, they should establish an altar and prostrate in worship. This will summon the black treasures of the Infinite World of the North and the black robes and official emoluments to descend into their body, dispelling the misfortunes of water disasters, shipwrecks, and carriage accidents, and ensuring the land’s abundant harvest.\n\nThe Yellow Dragon is the essence of the central seven lodges, descending to the human realm to protect and sustain the land. Within the Palace of High August Heaven, it transforms into the Dragon King of the Detached Palace, presiding over the yellow treasures and the five directional treasuries’ riches, providing the myriad people with clothing, food, and official emoluments. It dwells within the chambers of human residences and the treasure caves of famous mountains. If one in the world seeks to attain blessings and emoluments as they desire, they should establish an altar and offer devout prayers. This will summon the yellow treasures and official emoluments from the subterranean palace of the Central Earth Emperor to enter their body, causing their livelihood to flourish daily, their nobility to reach the royal throne, and all their wishes to be fulfilled. It will dispel the misfortunes of the five viscera’s hundred ailments and the calamities of the five stars’ influence upon fate. When the Star of Stability inscribes their name in the register, blessings will arise within them.\n\nThe Dao states: These Five Directional Dragon Kings excellently stabilize the land. Moreover, the Nine Dragons excellently guard the treasures, transforming and manifesting across the five directions. If a land’s five grains do not flourish, its people suffer famine, its royal taxes remain unmet, and its people flee to the mountains and valleys, filling the roads with cries of resentment, those who seek peace should establish a Nine Dragons ritual arena, recite scriptures, and perform the Daoist circumambulation. Heaven will send sweet dew, the hungry will be sated, the five grains will ripen early, flowers and fruits will bear flavor, and famine will be averted, sparing lives from untimely death—all through the power of the Dragon Kings.\n\nThe Dao states: If the lands under the jurisdiction of various states experience omens both auspicious and inauspicious, the five grains fail to propagate, and the people suffer famine, one may inscribe the names of the Nine Dragons on tablets of jasper, gold, and ivory. On the days of the Three Origins, these tablets should be driven into the earth to a depth of one foot and two inches, aligned with the five directions of the respective lands. Thus, the divine dragons will be pacified and anchored. Offerings of incense and flowers should be made at each position. After seven days, the Dragon King of the Black Palace, along with the Great Generals of the Northern Emperor, will journey to the Vermilion Brightness Palace to open the treasure vaults, transport the implements of the Seven Perfected, and proceed to the left valley of Goat Mountain to retrieve the five grains. Bringing these to the afflicted land, they will provide relief, allowing both heaven and humanity to enjoy abundance and dispelling all sorrows.\n\nThe Dao states: If the men and women of a land are born in years governed by the Ominous Star or ill-omened lodges, under the Five Graves or Four Cuts, their fate will not prosper, and they will encounter depletion and loss, lacking sufficient clothing and food. Anxious day and night, nothing will go as they wish. Those who seek blessings should establish an altar and devoutly recite the true forms of the Nine Dragons. On the twenty-sixth day of each month, they should burn incense, offer water, wear the true talismans of the Nine Dragons, and carry the Great Register of the Five Dragons. With sincere devotion and focused intent, the dragons will descend with heavenly might into their homes, granting their desires and bringing immediate benefit.\n\nThe Dao states: If the regional lords, governors, and magistrates of a land—from the two-thousand-bushel officials down to the district chiefs—wish to attain high official rank, remain free from disasters, enforce prohibitions effectively, and avoid disputes and litigation, they may inscribe the names of the Nine Dragons on ivory. On the day of Blessing’s Birth, they should stand it in the east, place it in a five-colored bag, and hold it with utmost sincerity. In their sleeping chambers, on the days of the lunar phases each month, they should offer rare flowers, exotic fruits, and pure water. The Dragon Kings will descend, their divine power protecting the people, aiding the royal transformation, and ensuring promotions and emoluments.\n\nThe Dao states: The ghosts of the Five Depletions are surnamed Lang and named Sengwen. The ghosts of the Six Losses are surnamed Huang and named Yuangai. Each year, they cause people’s depletion and loss, impoverishing them, obstructing their paths, and dissipating their wealth. However, by reciting the wondrous scripture of the Nine Dragons, making offerings, and prostrating in worship, and by transmitting the true talismans, these ghosts will be unable to harass them, and the ghosts of depletion and loss will instead assist in bringing blessings.\n\nThe Dao states: The Five Dragons and Nine Sages I have spoken of pacify and anchor the five directions and the nine palaces’ respective lands. Why is this so? The Dragon Kings govern the nine heavens above and stabilize the nine earths below, wielding the numinous power of the immortals’ officials. Ascending to heaven and entering the earth, they convey messages and bear radiant hues. Emerging from obscurity and penetrating the subtle, they live for ten thousand years, their essence attuned to the supreme Dao. If there are those in the world who possess divine insight and sagely wisdom, who cultivate truth and awaken to the Dao, as well as kings, great ministers, and those engaged in military campaigns, all may invoke the divine dragons for assistance and achieve victory.\n\nTheir forms arise from the formless, all endowed with numinosity. The myriad things of heaven and earth all arise through the Dao’s methods, establishing teachings and verifying them. The Dao Lord addressed the Northern Emperor, saying: Among the sagely beings of form, none surpass the dragon. It can summon rain and raise clouds, moving heaven and earth. It excellently guards treasures, spitting forth precious pearls of langgan. It bestows things upon humanity and safeguards the linked-ring treasure pearls. In the rivers, lakes, and grottoes, it amasses luminous moon pearls. Within the dragon palaces’ inner halls lie priceless lustrous pearls—marvels beyond description. Thus, it protects households and stabilizes nations. If one recites and upholds this wondrous scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Nine Dragons, establishing rituals and practicing the Dao, all within the land who suffer illness will be healed. Gold and silver will well forth, the eight sufferings will cease, all virtues will harmonize, and the Dharma’s sound will spread far. None will fail to obtain blessings; the lands will rejoice, and all will realize the formless.\n\nYou have not yet heard this; it is essential to propagate it.\n\nThe Dao states: If those born in the Lower Origin dwell in homes plagued by depletion and misfortune, their residences unsettled and disasters and illnesses frequent, they may establish a Five Dragons ritual arena. Morning and evening, at the three periods of the day, they should recite scriptures and perform the Daoist circumambulation. Then, immortal officials will descend, and the Eight Trigrams’ great spirits, the Virtue of the Moon, the Six Harmonies, and the Five Dragon Kings will be commanded.\n\nEntering their dwellings, it dispels depletion and misfortune, driving away malevolent spirits. It stabilizes palaces and chambers, safeguarding the household and ensuring descendants thrive. It broadly attracts official emoluments, drawing five-colored treasures into the home. For generations, there shall be peace and harmony, boundless wealth and nobility.\n\nThe Dao states: The Nine Dragons True Talisman brings official rank and emoluments, enabling one to attain wealth and nobility, with all wishes fulfilled. Those who carry this text shall remain untouched by disasters, respected by both officials and commoners. This talisman is accompanied by nine dragon spirits as officials, twelve jade maidens, eighty thousand generals of the Six Jia, six divine youths, and the Great General of the Northern Emperor, who constantly come to guard and protect. Above, it dispels celestial calamities; below, it scatters terrestrial misfortunes—no wish shall go unfulfilled. Without sincere reverence, it must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\nThereupon, the assembly of immortals offered this hymn:\n\nDragons transform without trace,\nYet their marks give rise to the Dao’s lineage.\nRoaming the nine heavens’ bounds,\nThey rest their chariots in the six peaks’ halls.\nThey uplift the loftiest guests,\nAnd join with our pure spirits in harmony.\nWithin the empty stillness of the ritual arena,\nDivine songs resound through the vast sky.\nForms perceive the tranquil court,\nThoughts chant, subtly connecting.\nDragon chants govern the offices,\nPhoenix cries echo in the celestial halls.\nSpiritual hymns leave no lingering taste,\nAll sounds disperse upon the wind.\nWho can rescue this chapter?\nThrough earnest recitation, praise the pure spirits’ ode,\nTo absolve the three paths’ transgressions,\nAnd extricate from the nine mysteries’ trials.\nWith reverence, pay homage to the Great Void,\nWhere blessings ascend beyond the heavens.\nNine dragons reflect the luminous pearl,\nTwo radiant essences face the true light.\nClouds soar in soaring assemblies,\nCelestial signs and the Fusang tree appear.\nHidden blessings mutually sustain,\nYin and yang illuminate the eight wilds.\nThe five stars shine brilliantly,\nDivine dragons unfold the cosmic order.\nIf one cultivates the utmost Dao,\nFreely they enter the Purple Realm.\n\nThe Dao Lord addressed the Northern Emperor, saying: This Nine Dragons Wondrous Canon is not to be transmitted to the unworthy. If a household possesses this scripture, it will attract treasures and priceless luminous pearls. I exhort all true disciples to reflect upon it earnestly. Broadly cultivate the utmost Dao, guiding those lost on the path. When merit is accomplished and virtue perfected, ascend into the formless. With profound virtue deepened, be born in the Southern Supreme Palace, free from all perverse realms. Your ears shall hear wondrous sounds, your feet shall ride the five-colored clouds. Your mouth shall feast on sweet dew, and your transformations shall be boundless.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, having heard the Nine Dragons Wondrous Canon and the origins of the Five Directions’ Dragon Kings, each rejoiced with refined delight. Throughout all worlds, the seven treasures welled forth, sparing all from hunger and want. The six directions were purified, the heavens free from defilement, and the five grains abundant. The assembly of perfected beings bowed in reverence and transmitted the teachings for practice.\n\nThus concludes the seventh scroll of *The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*.\n\n---\n\n**Section on the Register for Expelling Corpses**\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: Those born in the Lower Origin, with shallow karmic cultivation in past lives, endure many hardships in this world. Now, as the Yang Nine cycle turns and the Hundred Six count concludes, ghostly spirits roam chaotically, invading and disturbing the earth, where good and evil are indistinguishable. The Most High, in his compassion, revealed the *Secret Register of the Abyssal Cavern* and divine incantations to eliminate misfortune. Yet some root causes remain unexhausted, daring to lurk within bamboo, wood, water, and stone, harming the myriad people. Whether afflicted by *wangliang* spirits, perverse gods, the Five Maladies, or a hundred poisons, or whether entering battle and wrongfully losing their lives, I now issue this luminous teaching, wondrous talismans, and true diagrams to instruct all future true disciples. On days of calamity, transmit these with utmost sincerity to protect the people. Inscribe them on white silk, wear and venerate them—all perverse forces shall retreat, battles shall be won, households shall be tranquil, corpses shall be repelled for a thousand *li*, grievances shall cease, and good wishes shall be fulfilled as the heart desires.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The recipient shall recite these words: \"I, a humble subject of [such-and-such] kingdom, [such-and-such] official [so-and-so], respectfully present ritual offerings to the gate of the Heavenly Master, requesting to receive the Northern Emperor’s divine incantations and flying talismans. Under the governance of the Northern Dipper’s [such-and-such] Star Lord, may the Northern Dipper’s great spirits follow this humble subject [so-and-so]. Subdue ghosts, dispel demons, and grant peace in this life, tranquility for household and kingdom, with the Great Emperor’s protection. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: This talismanic diagram is constantly attended by sixteen divisions of the Northern Emperor’s great officers, one hundred twenty divine incantation generals, who ever shield those who wear it. They cause all perverse forces to scatter and submit, prolonging years and increasing destiny, eternally preserving primordial auspiciousness. If one enters battle wearing this text, weapons shall retreat, sparing them from the calamity of bloodshed and the eight difficulties.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born in the Lower Origin afflicted with lingering illness, whose souls are unsettled, beset by a hundred specters over years and months, they must kowtow and receive the *Luminous Register of the Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord*. Wear it upon the body—ghostly spirits shall retreat, all illnesses shall vanish, years shall be prolonged, and life preserved. These are the secret divine methods.\n\n**Talismanic Diagram and Imagery**\nOne Jade Maiden of the Luminous Mirror, one Jade Maiden of Life Preservation, one Jade Maiden of Life Administration, one Jade Maiden of Yellow Silk, one Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: These five women shall strike names from the ledger of death. The Lord of the Eastern Dipper governs destiny, prolonging life and increasing years. The True Person Lord of the Southern Dipper inscribes eternal life in the Jade Calendar. The Lord of the Western Dipper records names, inscribing blessings and emoluments. The Star Sovereign of the Northern Dipper erases names from death’s roster. The Supreme Tenuity Lord of the Central Dipper averts calamities, dispelling all misfortunes, ensuring peace in one’s dwelling and the vanishing of ghostly *qi*. Should any defiantly oppose this Dao, they shall be seized and consigned beneath the *Kuigang*, plunged ten thousand *zhang* into the earth. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: I issue this Dao to save the world and pacify its people. When the world is purified and at peace, merit shall be accomplished and the Dao fulfilled. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, within the Inconceivable City, gazed afar upon the Northern Emperor, broadly disseminating talismans and diagrams to save and protect the earth. He emitted radiant light, universally illuminating all heavens, even to the boundless worlds below.\n\nThus shall the people of the Lower Realm behold this radiance, their ignorance dispelled, that they may form karmic bonds with the Dao, return to their original nature, and receive its mighty power.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy raised a hand and snapped his fingers—an ineffable, jewel-like light, round as a mirror, issued forth from his palm. It pierced through the boundless lands below, even to the Three Wicked Paths and the Nine Dark Hells, all of which were illumined, bright and immaculate. The torments of hell ceased, and karmic retribution paused. The deaf, the blind, and the sixfold afflictions—all suffering was dispelled and healed. Men and beasts, birds and creatures, universally awakened to benevolence, no longer harming one another. By virtue of this radiance, all beings beheld with their whole bodies the Inconceivable City from afar, as though gazing into their own palms, none left unseen. Those who witnessed this light were destined to ascend to the Hall of Longevity and Bliss, entering the Jeweled City, where joy knows no end.\n\nWhat I now expound, all the Heavenly Worthies—past, present, and future—share in one mind and power. The dust-mote realms of the ten directions, all their Dharma Kings, together proclaim the subtle and wondrous meaning, the supreme sutra of the One Vehicle. Should even one person hear but a single chapter or verse, vowing to uphold and recite it for future ages—such a virtuous man or woman, wherever they tread, shall be untouched by calamity or illness. If one concentrates the mind, the Five Poisons shall be utterly dispelled. Again, I reveal the true meaning, the wondrous causes of practice: the perfected attain the Dharma, perceiving the body as utterly empty. Suffering and joy are not two, hatred and love share a single cause. High and low are not distinct, great and small differ not in form. The sun’s rising is not its first union, nor its setting its final demise. East and west are fundamentally unfixed; rising and setting know no direction.\n\nFurther, it was asked: by what cause did the Celestial August One bestow grace? At that time, the Northern Emperor proclaimed this subtle and wondrous talisman, addressing all virtuous men and women of future generations: in days of sorrow, practice tirelessly, wear my talismanic script, and ten thousand calamities shall vanish. With reverence and faith, devote yourself wholeheartedly to its observance.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*, as Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Volume Eight—Concluded.\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*, as Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Volume Nine: The Eight-Character Disaster-Dispelling Chapter.\n\nThe Dark Sovereign of the Northern Palace, the Black Emperor Spirit Lord, then addressed Marshal Tianpeng, the Ninefold Yuan Slayer Youths, the hosts of the Upper Clarity Yu-Yu Heaven, the Great Red Heaven, the Pure Tenuity Heaven, the Great Slayer Divine Multitudes—hundreds of millions strong—the Six Ding Great Spirits, the Six Jia Jade Maidens, the High Diao Northern Elder, the Three Slayer Spirit Kings, the Perfected of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Generals of the Samādhi for Driving Away Evil, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, the Great Spirits of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the River and Sea Deities, the Three Heavenly Demon Kings, the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword of the Kui-Dragon Chariot, the Great Spirit Slayer of Ghosts, the Edict of Lady Qing, the Great Spirits of the Right Division, the Twenty-Four Great Spirits Who Devour Demons and Consume Ghosts, the Four-Eyed Elder, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Six Ding and Eight Scribes, the Divine Soldiers of the Five Directions and Five Emperors—thirty million strong—the Four Illuminating Merit Officers, the Three Thousand Six Hundred Messengers for Communicating with the Real, the Black Slayer Great Soldiers, the Multitudes of the Nine Lands, and all the hosts of mountains, rivers, streams, and ravines.\n\nThe Emperor declared: I now wish to broadly proclaim this essential Dharma to save the celestial and human realms, severing their groans and agonies. Hearken well, all of you.\n\nAt that moment, the assembled divine officials, hearing the Emperor’s intent to reveal the wondrous scripture, rejoiced as one, wholeheartedly submitting in devotion.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The secret arts of the Northern Palace are not lightly disclosed. They heal illness, avert calamity, pacify households, and secure the realm. I know the people of the Lower Realm suffer deeply, their agonies unbearable. Unable to bear the sight of their ignorance and deafness, I now resolve to enact their salvation.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The Eight-Character Spirit Script is treasured in the Upper Palace. Through ten thousand kalpas, it has not been transmitted—such is its divine secrecy. Yet I see the ignorant and vulgar of the Lower Realm endure grievous suffering. Were I not to bestow it, they would wither without escape. Now I entrust it to you, that you may accumulate merit and treasure it. In times of calamity, practice it according to the method. Deliver the celestial and human realms, sparing them from sorrow and peril.\n\nUpon hearing the Emperor’s intent to proclaim the Eight Characters, the entire assembly prostrated themselves, five limbs to the earth, and joyfully recited this verse:\n*The sagely Emperor’s grace flows wide,*\n*Broadly opening the golden oral transmission.*\n*To save the people of the Lower Realm,*\n*Let their sufferings be utterly dispelled.*\n\nThe assembly, hearing the Dharma sound, rejoiced with every limb. The deaf regained hearing, the mute could speak. On that day, the Six Palaces trembled, and evil demons knew their fate. The great radiance was bestowed, and deep gloom met the bright sun.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: Perfected disciples here present, if you wish to practice my Eight-Character Spirit Script, face north and bow twice. I shall witness your sincere devotion.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those among the Lower Realm’s people afflicted with internal illness, write the characters in ink, swallow one with water, and recite the divine incantation. Upon reaching the eighth character, the illness shall disperse. For external afflictions, calmly invoke the divine power, write the characters in ink upon the flesh, beginning with the first. If it does not disperse, write the second beside it. In most cases, no more than three characters are needed for the illness to retreat. Remember this well, perfected disciples, and uphold it.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For men and women of the Lower Realm whose livelihoods falter, who suffer poverty and hardship, are assailed by ghosts and demons, or endure chronic illness—merely wear this Eight-Character Spirit Text, and malevolent afflictions shall vanish. Livelihoods shall flourish, calamities and demonic influences cease, and the Six Harms be dispelled.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: If the people of the Lower Realm suffer discord among kin, frequent quarrels, marital strife, or unrest among sons and daughters, they should devoutly and earnestly write the Eight Characters on plain silk on a day of harmonious conjunction, wear and venerate them. With utmost sincerity, divine youths shall attend them day and night, preventing strife. Sons and daughters shall grow in peace, or dreams may reveal matters, ensuring ten thousand harmonious unions.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born of the Lower Realm who traverse rivers and seas or enter mountain forests, or who march in military campaigns—merely bathe body and mind during the hours of *hai* and *zi*, and wear these Eight Characters inscribed on plain silk upon the person. Divine dragons shall guard and protect, the Wind Earl shall lend aid, battles shall be won and paths made clear, with none failing to achieve victory.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born of the Lower Realm whose fields yield no harvest year after year, or whose five grains suffer blight—merely receive and wear these Eight Characters of the True Text upon the body, and all cultivated plantings shall yield ten thousandfold profit. If, at the onset of summer, one prays for grace and makes a vow, pledging to uphold it until winter’s harvest, offering wine, dried meats, cakes, fruits, silver, and coin as tokens of faith, and follows the rites in presenting the memorial, then in gratitude for my divine power, pestilence shall be subdued, the Earth Duke’s heart shall be harmonized. The merit of the Eight Characters is beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born of the Lower Realm who hold office, from the lowest ranks to the highest promotions, constrained by public duties and charged with the care of others’ children—let them ensure that grace and authority are balanced, that all four directions are judged with fairness, that the path of impartiality is followed, and that harm is minimized while benefit is maximized. Let them receive this scripture and wear the Eight Characters of the True Text, and none shall fail to attain their desires.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born of the Lower Realm who seek immortality and study the Dao, who visit friends in search of truth, who refine elixirs and concoct medicines, or who conceal themselves in mountain forests—it is essential to receive this scripture, contemplate this wondrous Dao, and wear these Eight Characters. Without this text, efforts shall be in vain.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born of the Lower Realm, even perfected beings, who receive and wear this True Dao of mine—when intending to perform its rites, they must first purify themselves with ablutions, strike their teeth thrice, hold their breath for three cycles, and only then may they take up the brush to inscribe it. They should also visualize the spirits, recite the incantation, pass incense through the smoke, and sprinkle consecrated water, whereupon the divine response shall manifest.\n\n**Rites for Offering to the True Lord**\nWhen the Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord resides in the Palace of Mystic Radiance, within the Chamber of Nine Dragons, a seven-jeweled palace naturally arises, its thrones fashioned of crystal, jasper, lapis lazuli, and true pearls, adorned with ornaments rare in the world. Beneath the throne, an innumerable host of attendants, each bearing incense and flowers, offer reverent devotion. Those who come from the ten directions all approach before the Emperor, listening to the exposition of wondrous truths.\n\nThen the Emperor Lord smiled faintly and addressed the four assemblies, saying: \"From this time onward, the people of the Lower Realm shall be beset by confusion, with demonic spirits spreading unchecked, good and evil indistinguishable, their numbers beyond reckoning. You who seek learning must refine your bones and cultivate the true, not merely to guide yourselves but to deliver others, rescuing them from peril and relieving their distress. You must purify yourselves through fasting and abstinence, meditate upon the wondrous mysteries of the True Lords of the Northern Dipper, and rescue both heaven and humanity. Thus shall future generations universally attain peace, and the calamities and dangers of this world gradually dissipate. Such blessings are beyond all reckoning.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"When the people of the Lower Realm perform these rites, they must always do so during the hours of *hai* and *zi*, offering libations to the Seven True Lords of the Stars. They shall execute the *Yu* step, grasp the sword, and face north, burning incense with a sincere and pure heart, never treating the rites with disdain. If the libation is performed with merit, after a thousand days, the spirits shall appear in person—sometimes as a woman of surpassing beauty, sometimes as a beggar. When they appear, you must not speak to them but only bow your head in reverence and present the wishes of your heart. After the spirit has descended for some time, it shall suddenly depart; you must then send it off with a devoted farewell. Take the wine and broth from the altar and consume them, whereupon the spirit’s *qi* shall enter your heart, and you shall naturally possess heaven-born wisdom, knowing future events. You may discern the advance and retreat of armies, the rise and fall of households and states, and receive the illumination of sun and moon within your heart, your body born of water and fire. The spirits may appear as an old man or a youth, entering your dreams to reveal fortune or misfortune.\n\nIf one encounters the inauspicious conjunction of malevolent stars—when prayers go unanswered, official rank does not advance, illness and misfortune abound, the heart and spirit are restless, and strange dreams disturb the night—if cursed by evil men or when the household and state are unsettled, simply practice this method, and no harm shall befall you. You shall prolong your years, extend your life, and forever preserve your place in the world.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"If the land is unsettled, the four directions in turmoil, with roving armies, bandits, tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, and the perils of blades and weapons, simply perform the libation rites to the Seven True Lords of the Stars as prescribed in the scripture. Within two or seven days, the evil shall retreat, and the weapons of war shall fall silent.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"True disciples of the Lower Realm who offer libations to the Seven Stars, cultivate the true, seek immortality, prolong life, and aid the imperiled must await an auspicious day. On the third day of the Dragon’s movement, the fifth day of the Horse’s halt, the seventh day of the Pheasant’s flight, or the ninth day of the Dog’s establishment, perform the libation to the Northern Controller. When the True Lords descend, the blessings shall be ten thousandfold, enabling one’s name to enter the Pure Palace and one’s lifespan to be extended.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"At the time of the libation, present white silk and state: 'I, your humble servant [Name] of [State], respectfully address the Supreme Primordial August One, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder, the Prime Minister of the Immortal Capital, the Envoys of the Nine Heavens, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger of the Left and Right, and the Supervisory Envoys, beseeching your grace to witness and affirm my humble offering. On this day of profound rites, I reverently receive the divine *qi* and humbly invoke: the Azure Emperor of the East, riding the Azure Dragon; the Vermilion Emperor of the South, riding the Vermilion Dragon; the White Emperor of the West, riding the White Dragon; the Black Emperor of the North, standing with the Black Dragon; and the Yellow Emperor of the Center, riding the Yellow Dragon. I beseech each to attend the Mystic Altar, affirm my supplications, and bring all to fulfillment. May my heart be illuminated, my Way sought and attained, immortality sought and achieved, old age reversed, youth restored, and my being merged with the Dao.'\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"When performing the rites, take the incense, make your vows, bow your head in reverence, and present your words: 'I, your humble servant, today invoke the Divine Officials, beseeching the descent of great compassionate grace. I reverently invite the true *qi* of the Azure East to enter my body. I reverently invite the true *qi* of the Vermilion South to enter my body. I reverently invite the true *qi* of the White West to enter my body. I reverently invite the true *qi* of the Black North to enter my body. I reverently invite the true *qi* of the Yellow Center to enter my body. I reverently invite the Five Dragon Kings and the five-colored true *qi* of the Five Directions to enter my body. I, your humble servant, now invoke the true *qi* of the Dipper and dare to practice the arts of the immortals. I beseech the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors to execute and slay demonic spirits, and the Venerable Elder of the Nine Heavens to gather and suppress calamitous *qi*. After presenting these supplications, I shall gain the power of spiritual penetration and perceive heaven-born wisdom. I shall ascend to the imperial palaces above and enter the Hall of Blessings. The Nine Worms shall not arise, and the Three Corpses shall be eradicated. Through sincere devotion to the profound Dao, I shall reach the state of non-action.'\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"Benevolence pertains to Wood, its color azure, and it sweeps away misfortune. Righteousness pertains to Metal, its color white, and it subdues all spirits. Propriety pertains to Fire, its color vermilion, and it dispels ten thousand ills. Wisdom pertains to Water, its color black, and it washes away old *qi*. Trust pertains to Earth, its color yellow, and it supports all phenomena, capturing and subduing death. I tell you, future true disciples: those who understand the Five Phases and revere the Five Stars shall not be afflicted by calamity. If you further refine your cultivation of the star corresponding to your birth, know its name and designation, and invoke it at the brink of death, you may also extend your years.\n\nThose born in *zi* belong to the first star, governing Celestial Radiance and Yang Brightness, named *Tanlang* (Greedy Wolf), true name *Ge*, styled *Lushen-zi*. Those born in *chou* and *hai* belong to the second star, governing Celestial Inner Yin Essence, named *Jumen* (Great Gate), true name *Zheng*, styled *Zhenwen-zi*. Those born in *yin* and *xu* belong to the third star, governing Celestial Impulse and the True Person, named *Lucun* (Salary Store), true name *Ji*, styled *Weifu-zi*. Those born in *mao* and *you* belong to the fourth star, governing Celestial Assistance and Mystic Darkness, named *Wenqu* (Literary Brilliance), true name *Guang*, styled *Zihui-zi*. Those born in *chen* and *shen* belong to the fifth star, governing Celestial Bird and Cinnabar Prime, named *Lianzhen* (Upright Integrity), true name *Heng*, styled *Ziheng-zi*. Those born in *si* and *wei* belong to the sixth star, governing Celestial Heart and the Northern Culmen, named *Wuqu* (Martial Brilliance), true name *Wei*, styled *Dache-zi*. Those born in *wu* belong to the seventh star, governing Celestial Pillar and Heavenly Pass, named *Pojun* (Breaking Army), true name *Xing*, styled *Taibin-zi*.\"\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: The *Hetu* Treasure Script uniquely bestows the title of True Lord, capable of transmitting great power and aligning with the celestial spirits. If those of the Lower Realm’s walking corpses revere and conceal it, they shall naturally attain the True Dao.\n\nThe Northern Thearch addressed the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct, saying: Of all that is most revered, Heaven holds the highest place. That which governs and orders human relations is the Northern Dipper. Thus, the Northern Dipper serves as the Celestial Court. All who seek immortality and cultivate the Dao, harmonize Heaven and stabilize Earth, pursue prominence and manage affairs, or arrange marriages—all these depend on the power of the Northern Dipper. Even in the mundane world, every drink and every meal is recorded by the Northern Dipper before it may be received. If one wishes to avert disaster and eliminate misfortune, to dispel the ghosts of the walking dead, nothing surpasses offering sacrifices to the Seven Ancestors as the finest act.\n\nAlways on the day of one’s native *qi*, the day of the Six Harmonies, or during the *xu* and *hai* hours, in a pure and clean place, sweep the ground and make offerings to Heaven. Present white silk according to the nation’s customs, saying:\n\n*\"[Nation’s name], a humble subject, respectfully invokes the Celestial Thearchs, the Divine Lord of the Northern Culmen, and the Perfected Persons of the Northern Dipper. This humble subject, following the secret canon, reverently offers fruits to the spirits, beseeching the Lord Who Governs Destiny, the Lord Who Augments Fortune, the Immortal Who Advances Blessings, and the Perfected Who Delivers Across the World. May my name enter the Pure Palace, the realm know peace, the four directions be tranquil, the five grains abundant, and the Two Radiant Ones shine eternally. With utmost sincerity, I perform this rite.\"*\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Regularly practice the secret canon of the Seven Stars, and each time recite the incantation of the Northern Dipper:\n\n*\"I am the Heavenly Eye, moving in accord with Heaven.\nMy gaze flashes like thunder and lightning, illuminating the Eight Extremities.\nIt pierces through all within and without—nothing remains unsubdued.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Upon completing the recitation of the divine incantation, visualize the Northern Dipper hovering above your head, its handle pointing forward. Then envision the Northern Thearch gazing upon you, strike your teeth twenty-four times, and softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great Unity governs life, the Three Qi merge with the true primordial womb of the Upper Radiance.\nFather Mysterious and Mother Primordial,\nYou engender my five viscera and gather my spirit.\nBelow, you irrigate with jade liquid; above, you ascend to the Muddy Pellet.\nAt dusk, you summon the seven po; at dawn, you call forth the three hun.\nTo the right, command the Jade Flower; to the left, whistle to the Metal Spirit.\nGrant me ascent to immortality, command spirits and employ deities.\nEver preserve my advantage and uprightness, soaring through the Ten Heavens.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Upon finishing the incantation, visualize me enthroned in the Fengdu Palace, then recite the Heavenly Vanguard Divine Incantation, striking your teeth once for each line. Thus, the myriad calamities shall not afflict you, your merit shall be perfected, the Dao accomplished, and you shall mount the radiance to ascend to Heaven. If cultivated by a true adept of the Lower Prime, this becomes a method to protect the world. Wherever applied to deliver and rescue, ghosts shall be transformed into blood. The divine breath widely bestows salvation—none shall fail to respond.\n\n*\"Heavenly Vanguard, Heavenly Vanguard,\nNinefold merit slays the youth,\nFive Ding Governors command,\nLofty and fierce, Northern Mystery.\nSeven Governances, Eight Spirits,\nSupreme Lord quells the baleful.\nLong-skulled, colossal beast,\nWielding the Emperor’s Bell.\nWhite Owl, Three Spirits,\nSternly driving the Kui-dragon chariot.\nMighty Sword Divine King,\nSevering evil and eradicating traces.\nPurple Qi ascends to Heaven,\nCinnabar clouds blaze and surge.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nBody poised to drink the wind.\nAzure tongue, green teeth,\nFour-eyed Elder.\nHeavenly Ding warriors,\nMighty in the South, repelling the baleful.\nHeavenly Couriers, fierce and wrathful,\nMighty in the North, bearing blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers,\nGuard my ninefold enclosure.\nExpelling corpses a thousand leagues,\nDispelling misfortune and averting ill.\nShould any petty ghost\nDare approach to behold my form,\nThe Heaven-Splitting Great Axe\nShall hew the five forms of ghosts.\nFlame Thearch rends their blood,\nNorthern Thearch burns their bones.\nFour Luminaries shatter their remains,\nHeavenly Strategist annihilates their kind.\nOne stroke of the divine blade—\nTen thousand ghosts scatter in rout.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: For those born in the Lower Prime who diligently uphold my incantation, at the hour of *chou* each day, strike your teeth thirty-six times, sit facing the *ren* direction, and visualize the divine incantation:\n\n*\"On the left, the Azure Dragon, named Mengzhang of Jia-yin.\nOn the right, the White Tiger, named Guardian of the Army of Jia-shen.\"*\n\nAbove the head, the Vermilion Bird, Lingguang of Jia-wu.\nBelow the feet, the Dark Warrior, Zhiming of Jia-zi.\nThe spleen as the youngest child enters the Central Palace of Jia-chen and Jia-xu.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\n\nNext, visualize the Northern Dipper incantation:\n*\"I am the Heavenly Eye, pursuing the heavens.\nMy gaze like thunder and lightning, radiance illuminating the eight extremities.\nPiercing to see both without and within—\nNo being remains unsubdued.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!\"*\n\nAt that time, the Northern Thearch, with skillful means and expedient methods, expounded these scriptural secrets.\nAll the devas and sagely hosts rejoiced greatly and spoke in verse:\n*\"Wondrous is the Northern Thearch,\nWho reveals the *Scripture for Protecting the State*.\nShould one practice this sublime canon,\nThe great earth shall be suffused with light.\nDelivering those of future kalpas,\nThis is the seed of blessed karma.\nGuiding the children of the Lower Prime,\nMisfortune vanishes and truth is realized.\nCountless immortals and officials,\nRiding the void on six unicorns,\nCan annihilate the nine grotesque kinds,\nEradicating the hundred demonic forms.\nProtecting the state and pacifying the people,\nAiding the imperiled and sojourning guests.\nBelow, no evil dares stir;\nAbove, even dust is commanded by decree.\nWarm evil enters pure rectitude,\nMerit grows day by day anew.\nNaturally attaining great sagacity,\nAscending and descending into formlessness.\"*\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: The sacred power of this scripture shines with divine efficacy.\nAbove, it governs the Six Palaces; below, it commands the Nine Lands.\nNo spirit remains unsubdued; no ghost fails to submit.\nDiligently practice and reverently recite—\nThe true Dao stands majestic and towering.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: This text and its divine incantations share a single source with the Dao.\nThe constellations divide their ranks, each returning to its luminous mandate.\nThese ten scrolls of scripture broadly deliver devas and humans,\nServing as the great guiding principles of heaven and earth,\nBringing harmony and tranquility to the realm.\n\nShould any faithful scholar or perfected worthy of the great transformation seek to transmit this Dharma of mine,\nThey must purify themselves for seven days, dispel impurity, and still the spirit.\nWith reverence, invoke the Northern Thearch, never ceasing for even a moment.\nPray for numinous response to descend in dreams, revealing what is permissible for the practitioner.\nOnly then may one undertake cultivation—\nDo not casually transmit or initiate others. Be cautious, be cautious!\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: For those born in the Lower Prime who wish to transmit this Dharma,\nFirst obtain a numinous response.\nThis may be done at the hours of *hai* and *zi*, on the days of *yin* and *mao*,\nDuring the cyclical signs of *wang*, when stems and branches harmonize.\nFirst establish the altar of the Seven Primes, and perform the Dao according to ritual.\nEnter the purified chamber to kindle the incense burner,\nOffer prayers and present incense,\nSubmit memorials and perform the jiao offering.\nFirst empower the divine soldiers, then distribute the covenanted tokens of faith:\nForty-nine feet of green silk,\nFive feet of five-colored silk for each of the five directions,\nForty feet of white silk,\nOne blade,\nOne pure mat,\nOne *shi* and two *dou* of rice,\nOne *zhang* and six *chi* of green cloth with a woven pattern,\nOne *zhang* and two *chi* of green silk thread,\nBathing decoctions of a hundred herbs, and the five fruits—\nAll must accord with the regulations.\nOnly then may transmission proceed; do not lightly divulge it.\nThe scriptural text and divine incantations must be recited personally,\nNever concealed or obscured.\nFurthermore, three masters must bear witness,\nRecording the true covenant.\nEstablish the mysterious regulations and tokens of faith—\nDo not leak them, do not deceive, and do not transmit to the unworthy.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Those born in the Lower Prime are greedy for advancement and forgetful of retreat.\nTheir minds dwell on the dissemination of the Dharma, yet their thoughts lack single-minded focus.\nThey do not savor the refinement of bones and cultivation of the true,\nThe exhalation and swallowing of numinous fluids,\nOr the visualization of the Six Perfections.\nThus, ascent to the ranks of immortals remains unanswered,\nEarthly deities remain unsummoned,\nMeritorious fruition remains incomplete,\nAnd the path of cultivation remains unfulfilled.\nNow, I specifically instruct you all:\nSimply empty your minds and sincerely invoke,\nReciting morning and evening.\nThe immortal officials of the direct day will then inscribe your names in the register of the living,\nYour body will soar to the Great Ultimate,\nAnd you will merge with the Dao in unity.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Prime receive the Dao,\nYet fail to perfect their dignified bearing,\nDeviate from the proper covenant,\nNeglect the jiao offering,\nOr omit the recording of the Four Ministries—\nThe transmission of incantations and scriptures must be meticulously verified,\nAllowing no errors in talismans, seals, or written characters.\nOne must understand their origins.\nShould there be discrepancies, the Dharma will not be transmitted.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: On days of impending misfortune for those born in the Lower Prime,\nThey may solely receive the *Great Incantation of the Five Numinous Ones* and the *Great Register for Averting Corpse-Evil*,\nTo dispel the hundred demonic influences—\nThere is no need to receive the scriptures in their entirety.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: When those born in the Lower Prime receive scriptures and incantations,\nUpon completion, they must perform the jiao offering rites without negligence.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Prime receive the Dao and study this scripture,\nThey must establish altars for its veneration.\nWhy? Because the names of the mighty divine kings reside therein.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Those born in the Lower Prime who receive my scriptures and incantations must keep them secret and hidden.\nDo not urge or instruct the foolish,\nNor privately transmit them—\nThe divine soldiers will hold the transgressor accountable.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Those born in the Lower Prime who receive this Dao of mine and recite my divine incantations\nMust not face south with their backs to the north.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly in attendance,\nHaving heard the Dharma of transmission and initiation,\nEach followed the scripture and put it into practice.\n\n*Thus concludes the Ninth Scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Thearch’s Incantations for Subduing Demons, *spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.*\n*The Tenth Scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Thearch’s Incantations for Subduing Demons: *The Chapter on Divine Soldiers Protecting the State.*\n\nThe Dark Thearch of the Northern Quarter, the Heavenly Lord of Mysterious Virtue, at that time dwelt in the World of Abyssal Springs, within the Jade Mound Mountain of the Cold Land in the divine mound above the Pool of Still Waters beside the withered-rush tree. There, he convened with his retinue of attendants, the Youths in Attendance, and the Perfected of the Dark and Profound, an assembly of boundless multitudes. Thrice daily, they offered incense, scattered flowers, and lit lamps in reverent devotion, cultivating purification rites. They extolled the spontaneous and made offerings as their hearts dictated, fulfilling all in accord with their aspirations. Thus did they cultivate with diligence for over a thousand years, their merit yet incomplete, their vows unwavering. They revealed the secret methods of salvation and protection, expounded the mysterious rituals of expiation and thanksgiving, bringing peace to the state and the household, and delivering both the hidden and the manifest.\n\nThe Northern Thearch addressed all future true disciples: \"Follow the Dharma in practice, and you shall attain the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"In performing my essential methods, you must offer jiao rites and sacrifices to the great officials of Fengdu and all spirit-officials to manifest merit and reward. Establish a Seven Primes Altar, light lamps and burn incense, prepare exotic broths and the five fruits, and make offerings according to the state’s customs.

Follow the ritual protocols, prostrate upon the ground in visualization, all clad in black robes and vermilion crowns, wielding blades, halberds, bows, arrows, dagger-axes, and pole-axes. As they take their seats, none shall fail to respond—rise then and perform the rites of reverence.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"When invoking the incantations, address each by their proper title.\"\n\nYour humble servant respectfully invokes the assembled deities within and beyond the altar: the Heavenly Thearchs, the Perfected, the Ten Poles Elders, the Immortals, the Vajras, the Spirit-Kings, the Black Thearch Generals, the Great Might Demon-Kings, the Northern Culmen Fengdu Luoshan’s Six Cavern-Heavens, the Three Primes, the Six Ministries’ Lords, the tribal hosts, and the great deities of the Seven Primes within the Dipper.\n\nFrom the day your humble servant received the Daoist precepts, a covenant was made with the Northern Thearch and the Three Officials—every movement and thought is bound to this pact. Internally, it governs the body; externally, it saves all beings. With the mind fixed upon the true *qi*, blessings descend and disasters dissolve. The ritual prohibitions are strict, and none dare act recklessly. Yet I reflect upon my own duty, extolling the majesty of the Dao’s transformative power, widely benefiting heaven and humanity. For any who make supplications, I dare not refuse. Now, for the sake of the land’s calamities and epidemics, or the chaos of war and the ravages of marauders across the wilds—when the solar cycle’s *yang* nine has run its course and the hundred-six disasters arise—we beseech the Mysterious Bureau, reverently offering libations and viands to dispel calamity, resolve peril, and pacify the state and household.\n\nMay the Northern Metropolis’ Thearch-Kings with their three hundred thousand troops, the Merit-Officials and Spirit-Generals, the Six *Jia* Generals, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Day-Officials and Decade-Officials, the Direct-Command Envoys, descend with the invoked Celestial Immortals and Great Sages, the Three-Five Generals, the Eighty Thousand Mighty Warriors, the Three Divisions’ Generals, the Dipper’s *Xi* and *Ci* Generals, the Dipper’s Punitive and Destructive Generals, the Revolving Mechanism Generals who repel foes, the *Xi* Generals who dissolve disasters, the Execution Generals who scatter misfortune, the Life-Sustaining Generals who resolve peril—enter your humble servant’s body, follow and shield me. For the state and the household, above, dispel celestial disasters; below, scatter earthly misfortunes. Water and fire’s harms, the hundred poisons and pestilences, the thousand spirits and myriad demons, the brandishing of weapons and war—all are beseeched for deliverance.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"In the Northern Culmen’s Hall resides the Most High Jade Thearch, the Purple Tenuity Emperor-Lord, the Immortals’ Envoys, and the Nine Heavens’ Executive Officers. They can descend to the world to eliminate all disasters—water, fire, blades, and weapons. If there are men or women of the land whose punishments and harms reside in the Greedy Wolf star of the Northern Dipper, invoke the Venerable Lord of the Radiant Yang Mansion to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer calamities, demonic harms, or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Great Gate star, invoke the Venerable Spirit of the Yin Essence Star to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer punishments, disasters, or destructive forces in the Northern Dipper’s Wealth Star, invoke the Perfected Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Literary Star, invoke the Lord of the Mysterious Darkness to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land or within the astrological regions suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Integrity Star, invoke the Cinnabar Prime Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land or within the astrological regions suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Martial Star, invoke the Northern Culmen Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Ruined Army star, invoke the Heavenly Pass Lord to resolve and deliver them. May water, fire, blades, weapons, venomous creatures, and fierce beasts all dissolve of themselves. May the state and household attain peace, the living and the dead rejoice in prosperity. With the supreme elixir and numinous cinnabar, forever dispel disasters and epidemics, and attain longevity and enduring vision. The power of the Northern Asterism is beyond comprehension.\"\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"For those born in the Lower Prime, let this Dao be their constant practice in movement and stillness. I shall send the Perfected of the Dipper, the Three Terraces’ Assistants, the attendants of the True Assembly of Sages, to descend among humanity, to save and protect the living, to erase death and restore life, to gather souls and nurture destiny, to sever the *qi* of death, and to deliver them from the Three Disasters. If the land’s regional lords and the ten virtuous ministers encounter demonic calamities in their domains, or within the astrological regions of famous mountains and great marshes, let them practice this Dao daily. Heavenly dragons shall descend, warrior-spirits shall march, the *yin* and *yang* officials shall both come to the rescue. With sincere devotion and resolve, the Jade Maidens shall manifest, enabling the self-dissolution of war, and the world’s tranquility.\"\n\nAt that time, the Northern Thearch, having spoken these words, addressed the assembled multitude, urging them to diligently practice and recite, that they might gain blessings in this life. Transgressions shall disperse, good karma shall form, merits shall be fulfilled, and the Dao shall be attained. Ascend into the formless and natural, join the company of the True Ultimate, and clasp hands with the Highest Immortals. In the methods of salvation and deliverance, rescue comes first.\n\nIn verse, it is proclaimed:\nWith devotion, rely upon the incense’s pledge,\nIts rising smoke shrouds the purple court.\nWith single-minded resolve, follow the cinnabar will,\nThe Mysterious Heaven descends in emerald chariots.\nTransgressions vanish across ten thousand kalpas,\nBlessings extend for a thousand ages.\nIn the Southern Palace, life’s allotment is recorded,\nIn the Northern Bureau, death’s names are erased.\nSouls and spirits rest in their palaces and organs,\nThe *qi* of the passes attains purity and peace.\nWith divine power, mount the Great Mystery,\nWith wondrous traces, ascend to the Highest Clarity.\nNine generations ascend to the celestial gates,\nAnd humanity preserves its longevity.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"This is called *The Scripture of the Divine Soldiers Protecting the State*. If the land suffers calamities, simply hold to its recitation—bandits and weapons shall vanish, and the Three Luminaries shall shine brightly. If a household suffers from demonic epidemics or pestilences, practice exorcism and retreat, and merely recite and perform the sacrificial rites—no spirit-official shall fail to respond. When reciting the scripture, the divine soldiers descend. If, within the ritual arena, there is fear, or the banners and lamps’ shadows stir as if in wind, know that the divine soldiers have descended from the north, and all evil shall scatter in flight.\"\n\nAt that time, all the mighty warriors in the assembly, the Perfected, the Jade Maidens, and the true numina of the nine lands, having heard *The True Scripture for Protecting the State*, universally leapt for joy and vowed with utmost resolve: \"In future ages, should anyone speak our names or depict our forms, we shall hasten to that person’s sincere devotion, deliver them from disasters and illnesses, bring peace to their state and household, fulfill their merits, and enable all beings to together realize the Dao of Non-Action.\"\n\nAs the ritual nears its conclusion, bow in reverence and uphold its teachings.\n\n*Thus concludes the Tenth Scroll of The Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons, as Spoken by the Supreme Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin.*\n\n**Lamp Altar Diagram**\n\n**Mystic Instructions for Reciting the Scripture:**\nAccording to the method of recitation, one must purify and establish an altar. At its center, set a high table for the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen and Purple Tenuity, facing south to the east. To the east, arrange tables for the Heavenly Vanguard and the Sagely Wing-Protector; to the west, tables for the Heavenly Strategist and the Sagely Guardian. The five tables correspond to the five directions, each adorned with small banners of the five colors, along with wine and fruit.\n\nWithin the purification hall, arrange the lamp altar, placing tablets of the Four Heavenly Kings at its four corners to guard the altar. Offerings of blessed rice, scissors, a ruler, mirror, scale, lamp bowls, tea, wine, and fruit are made to the northwest. Atop the altar, set a high table for recitation.\n\nAt dawn, invite the Dharma Master to first present the written petition, then proceed as desired with scripture recitation and repentance rites. In the afternoon, follow the ritual protocol to establish the altar, ascend the seat, and expound the scripture. By evening, conclude with the offering of the completed rite.\n\nFor devout and faithful practitioners, it is also fitting to meticulously arrange the five tables within their own homes, reciting with utmost sincerity. The essence lies in reverent devotion and steadfast observance—neglect or carelessness must be avoided.",

Suddenly, the gates of heaven swung open, and gazing downward, a dense and surging crimson radiance was seen, intermingled with turbid qi. Dark and obscure, it rose from the northeastern realm of the human world, piercing the celestial palaces. Coiling and congealing, it refused to disperse, its vapors reeking of blood and putrid filth.\n\nThe assembled multitude was struck with awe and dared not speak. Then, from within the Dharma assembly, a Perfected One named Wondrous Conduct, replete with blessings and virtue, raised his gaze, adjusted his robes, and stepped forward. Drawing in his tablets and pacing with measured steps, he prostrated himself twice, kneeling in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\n\n“Your servant has heard that the realm of the utmost Perfected and wondrous is luminous and free of inauspicious omens, while the land of the formless by nature expels all monstrous anomalies. Though I have attended the Dao Lord for ten thousand kalpas, never before have I witnessed such a strange sight.”",

What portent of disaster or fortune is this? I implore the Most Sagely One to once more proclaim the wondrous canon, dispelling the doubts of all and tracing this phenomenon to its source, that those who cultivate the Dao may be moved to reverence and devotion.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning smiled faintly after a long silence and spoke: \"You all must know this—compose yourselves in stillness and quietude, for I shall explain it to you. The beings of the Lower Kalpa all descend from this very realm. Their forms, born of the undifferentiated True Unity, are endowed with thirty-six thousand divine qi. Yet though they are upheld and guarded in purity, they have long been swayed by yin demons, forgetting their origin and losing their root. Now that the reckoning of three nines has reached its end, ghostly demons proliferate. They cling to deviant paths, forsaking the source of the Dao. Their bodies, host to manifold spirits, are confounded by legions of yin demons and malevolent ghosts. Their hearts breed wickedness, and they slaughter the multitudes of living beings, aligning themselves with gods and ghosts to ingratiate themselves and seek spurious blessings. As the appointed cycle nears its close, they grow reckless and dissolute, disloyal and unfilial, unkind and unjust, delighting in perverse ways. Now, the Six Heavens’ ghostly spirits inflict wanton harm. Whether man or woman, old or young, they cut short lives not yet fulfilled, snuffing them out untimely. The souls of the dead, not yet dispersed, coalesce into baleful qi, their resentment and fury ascending in a surge—you ought to take heed of this.\"\n\nUpon hearing these words, Wondrous Conduct was seized with great dread. He addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Those ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens—what power and might do they possess? What supernatural abilities? How is it that they roam the mortal realm, inflicting all manner of harm, slaughtering and wounding living beings without fear, defying all dharmas and restraints? I beseech you, deign to elucidate this for your servant. Though I am dull-witted, I would borrow your sagely power to comprehend their origins.

Within that land rules an Imperial Lord named the Supreme Yin Fivefold Numinous Mystic Elder Black Thearch Numinous Lord. His attendant and chief minister is the Mystic Nourishment Heavenly Lord. The Supreme Numinous Lord, in his practice of true qi, descended to give birth to a Jade Maiden named the Supreme Mystic Night Radiance Jade Maiden. Together with the Lord and the boundless host of Mystic Numinous Officials of the northern precincts, they unseal the Northern Gate of the Supreme Mystic, called the Gate of Yin’s Vast Numinous Birth. There they expound the *Marvelous Scripture of the Supreme Mystic True Unity*, by which they govern and restrain the yin demons. All who taste this dharma’s savor—even the dead revive, withered bones grow plump again, and none suffer untimely death or unjust calamity.\n\nBeneath that land stretches the Great Void and Vast Wilderness of the Brine’s Abyss, its circumference beyond all measure. Its waters are foul, rank, and black, their depths unfathomable. At its center rises a mighty mountain, its summit piercing the azure vault, its base plunging into the windy springs, named Mount Fengdu Luo. It towers one hundred and six thousand li high, its girth fifty thousand li. Its roots descend ten thousand li into the water. At the water’s edge, where the mountain’s foot meets the deep, lies the Cavern-Heaven Realm of Yin’s Shadow. Its sovereign is the Supreme Yin Water Thearch, the Northern Yin Heavenly Lord. This cavern-heaven spans fifteen thousand li in circumference; its palace is called the Palace of Supreme Yin. His aides and ministers include: the Life-Generating Qi Lord of the Eastern Dipper, the Form-Generating Lord of the Western Dipper, the Prohibitions Overseer of the Southern Dipper, the Life Mandate Overseer of the Northern Dipper, the General Records Keeper of the Central Dipper, the Nine Commanding Subordinate Officers, the Prefects of the Five Marchmounts, the Twenty-Four Yin Officials of the Twenty-Four Governances, the Twenty-Four Yang Officials of the Twenty-Four Governances, the River and Sea Attendants, the Masters of Hills, Mounds, Streams, and Ravines, and a boundless host of lesser officers.

      "translated_text": "Within these prisons, grasses and trees all bear the baleful, venomous qi of nature, their growth forming blades and sword-points. Abounding in myriad poisons, fierce beasts, and raging flames, they are shrouded in black smoke and howling winds that never cease. Murky darkness and toxic vapors, blood-red miasmas and foul stenches fill the air. Chariots of fire and rivers of ash, iron rods and bronze hammers—tortures and torments resound with wails that shake the heavens. Here dwell the flesh-bound mortals of the Lower Realm, the sinful ghosts and dead souls.\n\nBeyond the cavern-heaven of Supreme Yin, to its left and right, lie three lesser palaces, each fifty *li* in extent, each governed by its own overseer. The first is called the Palace of Heavenly Officials, the second the Palace of Earthly Officials, and the third the Palace of Water Officials—all critical bureaus for the summoning of life and death.\n\nWithin these mountains stand six cavern-palaces, known as the Six Cavern-Palaces of the Supreme Yin Cavern-Heaven. Each spans five thousand *li* in circumference, and together they form the Six Ministries of the Nether Bureau. Each palace is presided over by a great demon-king, who commands a host of thirty-six myriad lesser officers—all monstrous and malevolent spirits of grotesque forms, some assuming the shapes of fish and dragons, serving as his guards. Their cavern-gates lie hidden in the boundless obscurity of the Great Void, perpetually veiled by swirling mists. Without the supreme power of the Heavenly Emperor, none may approach. These are the Six Palaces of the Demon-Kings of the Six Heavens, whose ghosts descend into the mortal realm to bewilder and confuse. They devour the blood and essence of pregnant women, inducing nightmares and evil thoughts. Some take the forms of cats or dogs to startle women, causing pallor, blood depletion, madness, and wasting illnesses. They feast upon the lives of mortal children, from infancy to ten years of age, cutting short those whose allotted span is not yet exhausted. The foolish and deluded, unable to cultivate spirit or prolong life, fall prey to these demonic forces and forfeit their destined years. These demons also bind the Nine Ancestral and Seven Generational kin of the living, interrogating them by name and entangling them in shared suffering—afflicting them with all manner of ailments: emaciation, sores, ulcers, festering wounds, scabies, leprosy, madness, blindness, deafness, and blockages. They bring calamities of wind and water, wandering souls, and nightmares; they bind with willow fetters, whip and beat, and impose extraordinary restraints, inflicting countless diseases too numerous to recount. They falsely seize the living’s years, fate, Three Hun, and Seven Po, submitting them to the Six Palaces, erasing their names from the register of the living and inscribing them in the ledger of the dead. Bedridden for years, their bodies transformed, they seek blood and sustenance. Some become the uncanny apparitions of female shamans, shaking bells and drums in ancient trees; others take the forms of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, or ancient kings, adorned with tassels and sashes. Some appear as demon-maidens of the Six Heavens, richly dressed and alluring; others as fierce generals or treacherous ministers of past dynasties, wielding halberds and swords. Some manifest as great generals of the heavens, riding the qi of the sun, moon, and stars through the mortal realm; others as the likenesses of the living’s seven generations of buried ancestors. Some assume the shapes of wild beasts, riding flying birds or driving serpents and rats, their five-colored radiance bewitching youths and maidens. Some possess strange trees or uncanny stones; others lurk in ancient caves or springs. A thousand forms, a hundred transformations—all to slaughter and harm the living. When pressed, they may seek arcane methods of restraint or suppression, but if their power proves insufficient, they retreat into their caverns, beyond pursuit. Against such evils, those without great might cannot prevail. Some possess the power to move mountains, uproot trees, summon clouds, and stir rain—unrestrainable forces.\n\nThen, Miao Xing addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: \"Though I am dull-witted, I humbly beseech your sacred power. Today, I request to lead the True Immortals, Flying Immortals, and Dragon-Riders of the Three Heavens to descend into the mortal realm and subdue these demons, that the living of the Lower Realm may be spared their torment.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied to Miao Xing: \"I do not send you forth to test your sincerity. Since you seek to subdue these evil spirits and perform a virtuous deed, you shall proceed.\"\n\nThereupon, Miao Xing arose from the Dharma assembly, leading the Three Heavenly Elders, the Ten Ultimate True Immortals, their celestial riders and flying generals, with heavenly music guiding the way. They journeyed due north, following the dense black qi until, several *li* above the mortal realm, their dragon-cranes ceased to advance, their cloud-chariots stalled, and their retinue of attendants recoiled, unable to press forward.\n\nThen, from among the assembly, a True Lord of the White Chariot and White Horse spoke to Miao Xing: \"The mortal realm below is thick with the stench of corpses and the foul qi of ghosts. We are the purest of the Three Clarities, beings of golden form and jade substance, companions of purity. To encounter such filth is unbearable—we cannot descend. We must return to heaven; to proceed further is impossible.\"\n\nThereupon, Miao Xing led the Daoist assembly back to the Heaven of Supreme Yang, where they prostrated before the Heavenly Venerable, kneeling to address him: \"Yesterday, I accompanied the Three Heavenly Elders, the Ten Ultimate True Immortals, and their celestial retinue to descend into the mortal realm and subdue the demonic spirits, to save and protect the living. Yet upon reaching the place, mere *ren* above the earth, our dragon-cranes would not advance, and our attendants and true followers all recoiled, overwhelmed by the foul and toxic miasma of the demonic spirits. I do not know by what method or art the living may be spared this devastation.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable then said to Miao Xing: \"At the summit of Mount Fengdu, on the northern frontier of the Void Origin, resides the Divine Lord of the North, who commands an innumerable host of mighty demon-kings, celestial soldiers, and thunderous storm spirits of the yin realm—possessing immense power. Without the Divine Lord of the North, none can subdue them.\"\n\nMiao Xing then addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"By what Daoist power may we summon this Divine Lord of the North, to save the living and spare them from the stench of corpses and daily harm?\"",

The baleful spirits and malevolent gods of the Six Heavens serve as his guards. To his left and right stand thirty-six prisons, each fifty li in circumference.\"",

      "translated_text": "At that moment, the Heavenly Venerable clicked his teeth and remotely visualized the Supreme Yin Northern Emperor within the Five Qi Heavens of the North. Thereupon, the Northern Emperor, perceiving from afar, led the Ten Heavenly Demon-Kings, the Eight Radiant Great Spirits, the Thirty-Six Cavern Heaven Ding Warriors, the Three-Five Great Generals, the Lofty Banner Five Lakes Great General, the Valiant Northern Dipper Seven Primes Great General, the Guarding Spirits, the Innumerable Flying Thunder and Lightning Officers, the Mighty Beasts and Poisonous Dragons, and all lesser spirit-officers, along with the Great Power Flying Heavenly Ghost Hosts of the Northern Yin—all assembling at once at the appointed gathering place. There, girded with swords and jade pendants, holding tablets and pacing with measured steps, he twice bowed and knelt, saying: \"Since I last attended your sacred banquet, barely ten kalpas have passed. Today, I remotely receive your secret decree and am granted the honor of beholding your holy countenance. I do not know what command or task the Most Sacred One has summoned me to perform.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Venerable addressed the Northern Emperor: \"The yin ghosts and demons of the Northern Darkness have emerged into the human realm, wrongfully slaughtering more than half of the living. Now, in this year of the Three Nines and Seven Fives, the living are benighted, and the harm wrought by ghosts and demons is especially severe. Their allotted lifespans unfulfilled, countless numbers are cut down untimely. Their yin souls do not disperse, lingering and coalescing in the dark paths. Innumerable grieving spirits surge upward, shaking heaven. You, together with the Ten Cavern Demon-Kings and the Three-Five Generals and officers, must descend to the human world and restrain these yin ghosts. When your merit is complete and your virtue aligned, you shall ascend into the formless and naturally attain the true ultimate.\"\n\nThereupon, the Northern Emperor twice bowed and received the command. He assembled the Ten Heavenly Great Demon-Kings, the Three-Five Great Generals, the soldiers and officers under the Three Masters, the Heavenly Peng Killing Lads, the Northern Dipper Killing Officers, the Mighty Beast Flying Officers, the Owl-Hooked Lasso Flying Officers, the Supreme Perfected Spirits, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Heavenly Couriers and Armored Soldiers, the Southern Dipper Demon-Slaying Envoys, the Northern Dipper Torch-and-Chariot Divine Officers, with purple qi surging forth and flowing fire stretching for ten thousand miles, descending into the human realm. Before the yin ghosts had even glimpsed the heavenly troops, ten days prior, they had already all encountered the Northern Emperor’s Supreme Mystery Killing Qi, which first shattered their brains, killing more than half. As the Northern Emperor descended, the skies and earth were swept asunder. Above, the Heavenly Net was spread; below, the Earthly Web was laid. The Heavenly Couriers and fierce beasts charged forth with gnashing teeth. The Heavenly Ding Flying Officers severed and smashed, crushing all. Some, not yet transformed in shape, had no place to hide. Some became dragons or serpents; others took the form of demonic maidens. Within seven days, all were restrained and destroyed.\n\nThereupon, the Northern Emperor led the heavenly troops back to the Upper Prime Heaven. In the Eight Radiant Jade Palace, he paid homage to the Heavenly Venerable: \"I, having received your sacred decree, descended to the lower realm and subdued the yin demons. Within seven days, I have broken the Six Cavern Ghost Palaces of Mount Fengdu in the North. I have assigned one Great Power Demon-King to each cavern, commanding them to guard and suppress it firmly.\"\n\nThen the Northern Emperor addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"In the lower realm, during the Three Nines and Seven Fives of the human world, many have accumulated great wickedness and transgressions. Deeply deluded and heavily burdened, they have summoned the cavern demons, who remotely exploit their depletion and secretly emerge into the human world. Some may not have been fully restrained, or when a person’s allotted lifespan nears its end, the yin caverns open of their own accord. If not forbidden and controlled, they will spread throughout the human world—across the Four Seas and Five Lakes, the Seven Marshes and Nine Rivers, the Five Peaks and Twenty-Four Grotto-Heavens, the mountains and rivers, pits and caves—becoming disasters for humanity. I have dispatched three hundred thousand troops to constantly patrol the human realm, rescuing the living from dire straits. If one recites my divine name and chants this incantation once, upon hearing it, the demon-ghosts will all have their brains shattered.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"In the lands of the lower realm’s living, should there be years of famine and grain scarcity, the Three Disasters of warfare, or pestilence spreading widely, causing the people of the nation to perish and blood to flow like rivers, one must purify oneself and seek the Three Cavern Daoist Masters. At the northern gate of the nation, establish and erect a Northern Dipper Seven Primes altar, light lamps, scatter flowers, perform the Daoist rites, and submit memorials. Recite my Six Heavenly Spirit Incantations, circumambulating for seven days, fourteen days, or forty-nine days. At that time, I shall lead the Three-Five Great Generals, the Heavenly Peng Division, the Ten Heavenly Demon-Kings, the innumerable hosts, the Great Power Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Flying Thunder and Lightning Cavalry, the Owl-Hooked Lasso Cavalry Divine Kings, the Ten-Thousand-Zhang Mighty Sword Southern Dipper Great Spirits, the Northern Dipper Envoys, with purple qi and flowing fire, to conceal and protect that place, sweeping away demon-ghosts, pestilence, bloodshed, and the foul, turbid miasma, rendering all pure and clear.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: \"In the lower realm, when women are pregnant and suffer miscarriage or death, their descendants fail to thrive in nineteen out of twenty cases. Some carry a child for one or two months, or even to term, but the fetus perishes in the womb, or the child grows to seven or ten years old before dying untimely. This is all because the woman’s blood and impurity attract the Six Cavern Heaven Demon-Mothers and Ghost-Mothers, who fly after the woman, consuming her essence and qi, repeatedly harming the fetus and blood. This causes the woman to become emaciated, sallow, and weak, plagued by nightmares and terrifying visions. These ghosts transform into cats, rats, civets, or dogs, devouring the woman’s offspring in her dreams. One must purify the halls and chambers, seek out Daoist masters, and according to the rites, establish an altar to worship the Northern Dipper Seven Prime Lords. Burn incense, light lamps, recite my divine incantations, perform the Daoist rites, and offer repentance. For one to seven days, I shall dispatch the Twelve Supreme Mystery Night-Luminous Jade Maidens to guard the woman, ensuring no harm befalls her and all comes to fruition. If, during a difficult childbirth, the Ghost-Mother obstructs and the Northern Yin’s impure ghosts seek to feed, devouring the birthing mother’s blood, causing her excruciating pain for a day or seven days—suffering unbearable agony, moaning day and night—one must purify the courtyard, establish an altar, perform the rites, and recite the incantations. I shall send the Nine Mystery Killing Lads and the Six Ding Jade Maidens to protect the birthing mother, sparing her from pain. The children she bears, whether male or female, will all be extraordinary in appearance, upright, intelligent, noble, and successful.\"",

I shall command the Life-Recording Lord of the Northern Dipper to expunge their names from the Black Register, and the Custodian Lord of the Southern Dipper to amend their entries in the Book of Life. Their years shall be extended, their lives prolonged, and disasters transformed into blessings. All mad and perverse demonic spirits shall be driven away and slain by the Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens and the Generals of the Three and Five, preventing them from causing further harm.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan seek to study the Dao yet fail midway, becoming lost, confused, and unable to progress, they must purify themselves through fasting and bathing, then recite my divine incantation—seven times or up to a hundred—whether walking, standing, or resting, regardless of defilement. As long as the heart holds the recitation, the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper shall descend, infusing their hearts with pure qi, dispelling inner demons, fortifying the body with a hundred spirits, stabilizing their inner sanctuary, unblocking the heart’s orifices, and invigorating the spirit.

Then, the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens, the Great General Tianpeng, and their divine hosts, along with the deities of the wilds, the Eight Radiant Spirit Kings, the gods of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, rivers, streams, and valleys, and the local earth spirits shall descend in response, encircling and protecting them. Fear shall vanish, safety ensured, their spirits calmed, and all malevolent forces dispersed.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan remain childless, it is because the Cavern-Heaven Demon Maidens and Ghost-Mothers, along with the Celestial Wolf and the Greedy Dog, devour their essence, severing their lineage. To conceive a child, they must set up a Northern Dipper lamp altar in their chamber, follow a master in practicing the Dao, burn incense, scatter flowers, recite my divine incantation ten thousand times, and offer morning jiao rites to the Northern Dipper. Then, the Twelve Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist shall descend to guard their womb, fulfilling their wish for offspring—children of exceptional appearance, intelligence, and longevity, whether male or female.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan purify their bodies and minds, reciting this incantation seven times or up to a hundred daily, whether in motion or at rest, morning or evening, all their endeavors shall succeed. Even in gambling or seeking profit, or when meeting nobles and rulers, they shall always find joy, their wishes harmonized.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should the five grains sown in the fields of the Lower Yuan be ravaged by locusts or other disasters, they must erect an altar in the field and recite the incantation seven or forty-nine times in accordance with the ritual statutes. I shall command the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces and the Earth Thearch to enforce a three-day prohibition, and all pestilent insects shall vanish of their own accord.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: These are the Six Demon Kings of the Six Cavern-Heavens, who perpetrate six harms upon those born in the Lower Yuan. The First Palace harms wealth, causing depletion and dissipation. The Second Palace harms life, obstructing success and causing official rank to decline. The Third Palace harms rank and emolument, blocking all four directions. The Fourth Palace harms fields, dwellings, and households, bringing frequent deaths, disasters, and spectral disturbances, rendering habitation unstable. The Fifth Palace harms wives and concubines, causing repeated deaths, from one to seven. The Sixth Palace harms children, preventing their birth or causing illness and extinction. These six harms are perpetrated by the demonic spirits of the Six Heavens, who conspire with the Six Bureaus of the Caverns to obstruct and afflict mortals. Those of resolve who wish to eliminate them must do so in a pure wilderness or a quiet chamber of an ancient altar, erecting an altar and practicing the Dao according to the ritual statutes for three, seven, or up to forty-nine days. They must submit a memorial, called the \"Six Harms Memorial Jiao,\" to the Six Jia Spirits, the Five Planets, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Palaces of the Sun and Moon. They must also wear the Great Register for Dissolving the Six Harms of the Three and Five. Then, the One Hundred Twenty Jade Lads of the Nine Palaces shall descend, along with the Great Generals for Dissolving Harms, the great spirits within the Northern Dipper, and the hosts of Tianpeng. They shall traverse the Six Yin Palaces of the Caverns, investigating and resolving each source of harm, permanently severing the calamities so they no longer entangle mortals.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan be conscripted by kings or nobles for battle, they must wear the Great Register of the Nine Palaces for Warding Off the Six Palaces and Averting Corpses, offer sacrifices to the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, and inscribe this incantation within the register, wearing it on the left arm. When facing the enemy in battle, they must silently recite the divine incantation seven times. Then, the Demon Kings of the Six Heavens, the Great General Tianpeng, the Envoys of the Northern Dipper, and the Great Generals of the Three Primordials shall secretly protect them, preventing injury and ensuring safety, forever averting the misfortune of violent death.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: Should those born in the Lower Yuan face harm from evil persons, they must visualize the malefactor beneath their left foot and recite this incantation one hundred thirty times. The evil person shall then turn misfortune into fortune.",

In a single battle against the great demonic chieftains of the twenty-four encampments, he subdued them all at once, confining their underlings and officers beneath the encampments. Now they have become the twenty-four mountain prisons for demons, utterly unable to escape. All this was achieved by the Most High’s transmission of this Divine Incantation of the Northern Emperor.

None failed to submit—this is the ninth stellar spirit of Tianpeng.\n\nZheng Siyuan said: I once heard that the Northern Flower Immortal of the Most High taught this Dao to novice Daoists, instructing them to recite it ten thousand times. First, it extinguishes inauspicious specters and malevolent spirits, and the true Dao is immediately revealed. I longed for this but could not obtain it.

      "translated_text": "These subtle and secret matters are not fully recorded here. Many derive from the *Upper Clarity Jade Emperor’s Scripture of Divine Wisdom for Dispelling Demons and Concealing the Jade Clarity*. The rituals and methods follow those in the lower scroll.\n\nThe Northern Flower Immortal said to Zheng Siyuan: \"Whenever reciting this divine incantation, one must tap the teeth once for each phrase as a regular practice—this is the ritual for cultivating truth. If reciting it day and night without pause, the tapping of teeth may be omitted. Should a living person encounter demonic affliction, sit upright according to the method and follow the four-syllable rhythm for tapping the teeth. Alternatively, first tap the teeth seven times, then recite the incantation three times. Tap the teeth seven times again, recite it three more times, and once more tap the teeth seven times. Then state the wish in your heart, and the demonic spirits causing harm will all go blind, their eyes fester, and they will die. This divine incantation comprises the names of the demon-slaying offices, the secret words of the Northern Emperor. If one masters this method and practices it regularly, abstaining from meat, impure foods, and miscellaneous indulgences, one may repel all evils, increase blessings and longevity, prolong life and avert calamities, dispel disasters and ward off misfortune, and protect the living from untimely harm.\n\nAs the scripture states: When tapping the teeth, the sound should resonate internally, clear enough to be heard by the ear.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said to the Northern Flower Immortal: \"In recitation, one must purify the heart and focus the mind, avoiding all杂事 and heterodox methods. Do not share the same chamber, for these are guarded by the malevolent spirits of the Six Heavens. If worldly people treat this as mere casual recitation or entertainment, failing to revere it with devotion and slighting the true words, the Heavenly Venerable of the North will be enraged, and boundless calamities will follow. Be cautious and reverent.\"\n\nAt that time, the assembly of celestial sages and great worthies, upon hearing this scripture’s method of salvation and protection, all rejoiced and leapt for joy. They awakened the supreme Dao-mind, advanced in rank by natural progression, and, bearing the majestic power of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning, bowed their heads in reverence and pledged to uphold it.\n\nThus concludes the *First Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantation, Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning*.\n\n**Second Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantation, Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Original Beginning: The Secret Teachings of the Seven Primes**",

The Four Luminaries shatter your bones, the Northern Dipper blazes bright. With a single stroke of the divine blade, the ten thousand ghosts punish themselves. Chills and headaches, feverish pains—you shall not recklessly arise. The wood *qi* of the East extinguishes your form. Subdued within the spleen, you shall not stir or topple. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nOnce the Rite of Slaying Pestilence is complete, first recite the Heavenly Peng’s upper incantation. When daily practice is fulfilled on the *jiazi* day, wear the Great Register and establish the Seven Primes Altar. First recite my command to the Five Marchmounts’ Water Incantation:\n\nI am a minister of the Most High, my name inscribed in Jade Clarity, supreme over the Six Heavens. The Northern Thearch’s Ghostly Palace is entirely my domain. All under my command—what ghost dares arise? On my left hangs the *huoluo* blade, on my right the Fire Bell. Casting fire ten thousand leagues, my might subdues a thousand spirits. Those who offend are slain, those who resist are punished. The Imperial Lord commands: seize and capture without cease. Heavenly light and thunderous roars—move, and the myriad evils bind themselves. Ghosts and demons perish utterly; I attain long life. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Imperial Lord says: Upon finishing the incantation, immediately recite my summons to the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings, the Eight Radiant Great Spirits, the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens’ Mighty Powers, the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, the Generals of the Three-Five Forbidden *Qi*, the Guardians of the Numinous, and the Flying Thunderbolt Cavalry Incantation:\n\nBeasts of the Poisonous Heavens, guard the four gates. Divine soldiers by the myriad, the Nine Ugly by the ten thousand. Throats gape to split the sky, fierce steeds gallop high. Poisonous dragons brandish claws, golden heads devour sideways. Mighty warriors by the countless thousands receive the talisman and examine the immortals. The Six Heavens unrestrained, banding malevolence into hordes. Demons, goblins, and specters—foul *qi* swirls in chaos. Hollow songs echo, incense clouds scatter in disarray. Lesser ghosts assume false forms, blocking the Gate of Human Life. What the Divine Kings proclaim, none fail to hear. Above, they seize the Six *Qi*; below, they inspect the river sources. The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways swiftly distinguish good from evil. By the thousands, by the ten thousands, come before me. The Five Thearchs record merits—those with merit are pardoned. Malevolent demons and spirits are bound and lashed. Dare disobey, and none escape execution. Livers are hacked, gall crushed, heads severed, forms annihilated. Northward, the *jue* cleaves the clear broth; southward, fire burns at Nanshan. The Golden Perfected slays *qi*, the Flowing Bell captures souls. No demonic essence remains; all evil sources are swept away. Bearing the Heavenly Script, the Dao’s true writ is followed. The Nine *Qi* are cleansed, the Three Primes made clear. The Mysterious Numinous ascends in truth, uniting with the natural. None dare test me—after the slaying, report to Heaven. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: After reciting the Southern Guardian Incantation, then recite the Altar-Binding Incantation:\n\nThe Vermilion Bird’s radiance presses inward, divine might expands within. The four mountain sources are guarded; ghostly wells flee in terror. The spirit pool exhales *qi*, evil essences hide within. The Soul Terrace’s Four Luminaries, the jade doors gleam. The Jade Perfected stands majestic, seated to guard the Hall of Light. Hands wield the purple aurora, head crowned with divine radiance. Reciting the Grotto Scriptures, thirty-nine chapters. Within lies the demon-expelling, dragon-tiger slaying *gang*. Fierce beasts and charging oxen, blades in jaws, swallowing metal. Uplifting mountains, cauldrons overturning the sky, divine birds and poisonous dragons. Six jaws spew fire, devouring the King of Ghosts. Lightning boars and thunder fathers, dragging stars in streaks. Owls and blazing hybrids, moving crosswind. Heavenly birds arrayed in formation, all beside me. Spewing fire ten thousand fathoms to dispel misfortune. Spirits open the Dao, sealing and casting into mountain villages. A thousand spirits, ten thousand numina, all bow with clasped hands. Marsh wardens hold censers, burning incense for me. Wherever I go, the myriad spirits welcome. Heavenly beasts come to guard, a thousand essences tremble and submit—none dare disturb my *qi*. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nExit the chamber and stand again.\n\n**Talisman for Eradicating Locust Plagues in the Realm**\nThe Northern Thearch says: If a state, prefecture, or county suffers a locust plague, causing the people distress and preventing them from their livelihood, simply establish a Seven Primes Altar before the northern gate of the prefecture. Perform the Dao and cast my two spirit talismans. One talisman, inscribed on raw iron, is thrown into the prefecture’s river, where it transforms into black *qi* piercing the sky, and sweet dew descends. Another talisman, inscribed on catalpa wood with realgar, is buried in the Earth God’s temple, one foot two inches deep—then the locusts will instantly perish.\n\nThe right talisman: Use a square of raw iron, inscribe in cinnabar, and cast into the state’s great river.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: After binding the altar, perform the Dao to seek the heart’s desire. Use a catalpa wood board, one foot two inches long, inscribe it, and bury it in the Earth God’s temple—the locusts will perish.\n\n**Northern Feng Seal for Slaying Ghosts**\nThe Northern Thearch says: For those born in the Lower Prime, whether man or woman, afflicted by mountain *chi* and ancient specters, spirit altars and village shrines, or demonic spirits and wild anomalies causing illness—raving speech, madness, entering water without fear of death—use my Northern Feng Seal to stamp the afflicted’s heart, and the illness will immediately cease. Carve it from jujube wood’s core, perform three annual offerings, then it may be used.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: In the upper scroll of this scripture, I proclaimed the myriad sufferings of those born in the Lower Prime—official talismans and slander, illnesses and calamities, or entering battle and facing enemies, all manner of epilepsy. Simply carry this talisman, and recovery follows the appointed day. Those entering battle wear it on their heads, where one man equals a hundred, forever avoiding the misfortune of blade wounds, as divine soldiers protect them.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: For those born in the Lower Prime with troubled hearts, repeatedly suffering deadly misfortunes, or women whose pregnancies fail, or men and women dying prematurely, or those wronged by evil people’s schemes, cursed and punished—simply suppress it with my Fire Bell Imperial Register for great fortune.\n\nThe right talisman is from the *Hengshan Record*.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: To seal mountains and peaks, command ancient temples, summon the Five Marchmounts’ spirits to reveal past and future events, or to move mountains and overturn seas, and to expel demonic spirits.",

Two hundred feet from the altar, recite the Heavenly Peng Mantra upon the altar, and the ghosts and spirits will appear before you, promptly answering questions of future events.\n\nThe Northern Thearch says: Whenever performing rituals for all under Heaven, choose the days of *jiazi* or *gengshen*. If transmitted to the unworthy, it will cause madness, illness, and death—proceed with reverence and caution. Should one holding the mantra consume the Five Pungents with an impure mouth, the Heavenly Peng General will glare in wrath, causing the person’s spirit and soul to fall, leading to madness and possession, which is most difficult to cure.\n\nAfter completing the rites to the Seven Spirits, take the seven cups of wine from the altar and drink them. After seven days, divine powers will arise naturally, wisdom will flourish in the heart, and one’s dignity and wonder will radiate—guard this secret, for its efficacy is profound.\n\n**Altar Ritual and Palm Chart**\nThe Northern Thearch says: The wondrous scripture I expound can dispel celestial disasters above and stabilize the imperial seal below, eliminating inauspicious omens.

Let it be transmitted in secrecy and upheld for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n**The Supreme Northern Thearch’s Plain Spirit Talisman for Beheading Evil and Destroying Demons and Ghosts**—should one wear it, it preserves life and extends years. If affixed within a chamber door, it dispels all demonic spirits and ghosts, as the talisman’s envoys behead evil and destroy ghosts, bringing great fortune.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery Northern Thearch’s First Divine Talisman**—for disciples of the Lower Prime who cultivate the Dao: if worn, it grants long life and eternal vision, repelling corpses and beheading evil to destroy demons.

It overturns heaven and earth, beheading all evil demons. Each is subdued and made to protect the body, granting long life and destroying ghosts.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Third Talisman**—cures all illnesses. Worn to protect the body and life, it restrains all ghosts, beheads evil, binds spirits, dispels disasters, eliminates misfortune, repels evil to restore rectitude, safeguards the person, and grants long life and eternal vision.\n\n**The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Fourth Talisman**—expounds the Northern Thearch’s true scripture, the jade text register for repelling corpses, saving and healing the people’s illnesses and calamities. This jade-character divine talisman is bestowed to execute and behead demonic specters. Should one wear it upon the head, it repels corpses for a thousand *li*. If demonic spirits or specters afflict a household, affix the talisman within the hall or chamber, and all will be beheaded and annihilated.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Fifth Talisman**—beheads flying corpses, demonic specters, and evil spirits, and breaks the misfortune of households plagued by death. Those harmed should wear it to protect their lives, bringing great fortune.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Sixth Talisman**—averts disasters of water and fire. Worn upon the body or affixed within a door to pacify a dwelling, it brings great fortune.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Seventh Talisman**—cures those afflicted by pestilential epidemics, miasmic poisons, and demonic plagues. Those suffering should wear this talisman to attain eternal peace, as evil ghosts are destroyed.\n\n**The Northern Thearch’s Eighth Talisman**—purifies defilement, repels evil, drives away demons, and dispatches specters, preventing harm to people. It preserves life, protects the body, and extends years, bringing great fortune.\n\nThe preceding eight talismans, bestowed by the Five Spirits Mysterious Elder Thearch, can save all sentient beings from disasters, epidemics, and illnesses.

      "translated_text": "The Dao speaks: The Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction, at that time, was within the Cloud Radiance Palace atop the Ultimate Divine Elixir, seated upon the Mystic Terrace’s treasure throne in the Fivefold Luminance Palace. Ten wondrous spirit banners hung down; he wore a mantle of parted net, a flowered crown of precious radiance, a flying phoenix feathered skirt, and cloud-brocade shoes adorned with jade blossoms and seed-pearl patterns. In his hands he held a scepter of green jade, a case of seven treasures, and a cloud-brocade phoenix-patterned desk. His ornaments were of fluorite and blossoming jade; a fragrant censer of jade phoenix stood before him, along with a divine tiger-and-dragon sword. A luminous jade table of flying clouds and phoenix qi stood beside him, with a kingly lynx-feather whisk. Realized beings stood in attendance to his left and right, arrayed in ranks, gazing upon his august countenance.\n\nThe Mudra of the Northern Thearch: the thumb clasps the little finger, the four fingers press upon the thumb, while the second, third, and fifth fingers remain straight.\n\nAt that time, the Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction suddenly smiled faintly, stirring his dharma-sound. Divine radiance blazed forth, suffusing the ten directions and the boundless worlds.\n\nThen, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the Eastern Direction, with his retinue of nine thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat. The Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Southern Direction, with his retinue of three thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat. The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction, with his retinue of seven thousand billion realized beings and mounted officers, came and entered his seat.\n\nAt that time, the Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction summoned the Northern Mystic Perfected and the jade lads attendant upon the realized, commanding them to attend his seat. In an instant, myriad transformations occurred: the palaces, halls, towers, and pavilions were all adorned with crystal, fluorite, coral, amber, and intricate carvings. Golden qilin and lions were arrayed throughout the seats.\n\nThe Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction first paid homage to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord of the Eastern Direction, then to the Three Qi Heavenly Lord of the Southern Direction, and next to the Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction. Each took their seats and discoursed upon the records of the living and dead, male and female, of the Lower Realm of Fengdu.\n\nSuddenly, the cries of aggrieved souls in the ghostly prisons were heard, their wails of pain ceasing only in death. Then were seen the dead souls, untethered in the dark of the netherworld, unregistered by the ghostly officials.\n\nAt that time, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lord of the Western Direction, seated to the west, inquired: “What karmic retribution befalls these sinful beings? The dead souls endure torment unbearable.”\n\nThe Five Spirits Thearch of the Northern Direction replied: “The dead souls of the Lower Realm endure torment. For in their former lives, they were unfilial and disloyal, lacking righteousness between ruler and minister, lacking kindness between father and child. They disrespected the Three Luminaries, disbelieved in the principles of the unseen, deceived their teachers, slandered the Dao, rebelled against their kin, wantonly took lives, and indulged in greed and lust. Fengdu strips them of their allotted years, cutting short their lives in middle age. Their dead souls face retribution; their kalpas are exhausted, and there is no deliverance.”\n\nThe Seven Qi Heavenly Lord further asked: “Why are these dead souls untethered, unregistered by the ghostly officials?”\n\nThe Northern Thearch replied: “These beings, in their former lives, indulged in wine and meat, slaughtered without restraint, performed no virtuous deeds, and acted contrary to the Dao. Though their allotted years were not yet spent, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens’ Cavernous Palaces seized upon their transgressions, unleashing plagues and poisons, cutting short their years. They perish by water, fire, bandits, epidemics, blades, and warfare—perils to life. They suffer from official and private disputes, shackles, and obstacles, their endeavors thwarted. Year after year, countless meet such fates.\n\nI possess *The Threefold Wondrous Mantra Canon of Fengdu* and the methods of the Northern Thearch. If one can purify the heart, single-mindedly practice my Dao, uphold the canon, and establish a Sevenfold Primordial Altar with incense and lamps, offering devotion day and night without weariness; if one recites my divine mantras, visualizes the true and contemplates the spirits without distraction—then I shall dispatch the Heavenly Peng divine soldiers, the Red Slayers of the Abyssal Cavern, the guardian spirit-generals, and the Sevenfold Primordial warriors of the Vast Expanse to protect your body. Thus, all illnesses shall disperse, and those you treat shall recover. The impoverished shall gain wealth, the imperiled shall find safety, the lowly shall rise in station, and all seekers shall attain their desires.\n\nFor the living men and women of the Lower Realm afflicted by madness, ghostly possession, or extraordinary anomalies—simply follow my precepts and rituals, wield my divine mantras, pace the celestial stems, and align with the Seven Stars and the Dipper. Employ the mudras with single-minded focus, and the divine soldiers shall descend at once to guard your body.”\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: “If later students of the Dao have not yet perfected their merit, they must rely upon my great seal of Fengdu for subduing and recording ghosts and spirits. Carve it from red jujube wood, five inches long and four inches wide. On a *renchen* day, engrave it in a secluded place in the northern outskirts, unknown to men or dogs. After offering seven cups of wine and seven portions of dried meat as sacrifice, bury it in a *gui* earth. Recite the incantation:\n\n‘The Northern Thearch’s divine seal,\nWorn by the realized spirits,\nThe Three Masters descend,\nFollowing my command.\nPartake of my offerings,\nAnd blessings and longevity shall arrive.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Great Thearch’s oral decree and ordinance.’”\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: “To heal all illnesses, visualize the spirits. First sound the celestial drum three times, then the celestial bell three times. Next, visualize your master of transmission standing to your left and right. Sound the celestial drum nine times, then close your eyes and envision the Northern Ultimate Spirit Lord in the empty void above, wearing a great dark crown and radiant feathered robes, descending to the altar.\n\nNext, visualize the seven stellar spirits, childlike in form, clad in vermilion robes and red headbands, descending to the altar. Then visualize the Great General of the Left, Concealer of the Body, above the second finger. His surname is Tang, given name Hong, style Wenming. His home is in Kuaiji. His body is eighty *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments. He wields a precious sword, leading three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging from your left kidney to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Great General of the Right, Spirit Radiance, above the middle finger. His surname is Ge, given name Yong, style Wendu. His home is in Yuzhang. His body is seventy-two *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments. He wields a jade halberd, leading three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging from your right kidney to stand in attendance before and behind you.\n\nNext, visualize the Great General of the Center, Concealer of the True Form, above the fourth finger. His surname is Zhou, given name Wu, style Wengang. His home is in Wu Commandery. His body is ninety-six *zhang* tall, crowned with a celestial cap and red headband, clad in a crimson unlined robe and resplendent feathered garments.

      "translated_text": "**Talisman of Longevity**\nThe four talismans of longevity above—swallow them on the four seasons, eight solar terms, dark and new moons to extend years and increase lifespan.\n\nThe **Northern Emperor** declares:\nMy sixty-six true talismans are all divine scripts of the Northern Palace, slaying demons and curing illnesses. Only with utmost sincerity, inscribe them in five colors with destined patterns, and receive them from a master with a devoted heart. Above, they repay the nation’s grace; below, they protect the myriad people. Dragon spirits guard and defend, turning foes into kin. Divine immortals govern transformations, and ghosts dare not encroach upon mortals.\n\nThe **Talisman Incantation** states:\n*Zi Wen.*\nNorthern Black Emperor, revered among the ten thousand sages.\nGrand Tenuity’s Six Jia, the Five Qi Spirit Lords.\nRadiant as sun and moon, majestic as heaven and earth.\nFlying talismans seize and execute, sealing the gates of ghosts.\nMarching spirits deploy *qi*, dispelling the Five Afflictions.\nLeft and right officers and soldiers, the Three and Five Generals.\nThunder Lords and lightning bolts, winds whirling in haste.\nBlades fall like rain, ranks arrayed like clouds.\nHands grasp the Emperor’s bell, heads crowned with Kunlun.\nTraversing the world, they capture and subdue ghosts and spirits.\nThe Nine Provinces’ earth gods, blood-offering guests—\nnone may resist. Should any dare to spread their scales,\nthe Star of Pacification binds their hands, the Northern Emperor seizes their souls.\nThe Three Terraces and Seven Stars wield swords to sever their bodies.\nCrimes shall not be lightly punished; calamity extends to descendants.\nEvil spirits and *wangliang*—let their ears not hear.\nThose who hear me die; those who oppose me are eradicated to the root.\nHeads shatter, brains split, crushed to fine dust.\n*Hasten! As the True Talisman of the Most High commands!*\n\nThe **Northern Emperor** declares:\nFor those born in the Lower Yuan—be they man or woman—who receive and uphold my secret method and heal the myriad people, all must purify body and mind, bathe, and fast. Follow the rites to perform the ritual, offering libations to the Seven Primes. Altar stations must be solemn and pristine, with wine, dried meats, five fruits, incense, and lamps. Wear my divine talisman, recite my divine incantation, and focus the mind unwaveringly. Then the Seven Perfected shall descend, spirit generals shall secretly assist, and every wish shall be fulfilled without fail.\n\nIf one receives and upholds this method with an impure heart or insincere devotion, they waste gold and jade in vain, and no divine efficacy shall manifest.\n\nThe **Northern Emperor** declares:\nI dispatch the Six Ding officers and generals to seize and execute ghosts and spirits, driving away demonic fiends. Those born in the Lower Yuan who seek to learn but have not yet attained my supreme Dao must first employ talismans and seals to subdue external demons and cure all illnesses. Summon the officials of the Fengdu Ghost Register to advance their immortal ranks, their names inscribed on jade slips. Beware of recklessly transmitting this to the unworthy, lest the seven generations of ancestors in Fengdu be seized and tormented, and the living have their lifespan stolen.\n\nAt that time, the Four Directional Emperor Lords, hearing the Northern Emperor expound the divine incantations, talismans, seals, and secret methods for subduing demons, praised the Five Numinous Emperor Lords—whose divine power is subtle and wondrous, beyond comprehension. The great assembly paid reverence, the Six Heavens trembled, and the teachings were entrusted to true disciples.\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on the Northern Emperor’s Subduing Demons Divine Incantation, Wondrous Scroll Three, concludes.**\n\n**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture on the Northern Emperor’s Subduing Demons Divine Incantation, Wondrous Scroll Four: The Chapter on Warding Off Calamities**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden, expounding the Dharma and reciting the precepts to the assembly of heavenly youths. When the discourse concluded, the Most High Dao Lord approached, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\nToday, seated in attendance, I have heard the twenty-four articles of the luminous true precepts, the karmic retribution of good and evil, and my heart rejoices, my mind is liberated, with no lingering obstructions. Moreover, I have been graciously instructed on the karmic connections of sin and fortune, the Dharma of deliverance through purification rites, and the salvation of suffering souls in the long night, ascending to the Hall of Blessings where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. This Dharma is vast and universal; the deceased all rely upon it.\n\nYet, the men and women of this world and the next, who have not encountered the scriptures and precepts, are weak in *qi* and strength, unable to uphold them, and thus lack means to ward off calamities. Many are harmed by worldly malevolent ghosts and demons, their lives cut short, failing to complete their natural lifespan. Since the Heavenly Worthy has opened the transformation of great compassion, benefiting both the living and the dead, the living and the deceased alike bear this grace. I humbly beseech your mercy to further reveal the methods for men and women of future generations to protect their bodies and preserve their lives, that they may escape calamities. In this world, they face the Three Disasters and Nine Adversities, the Five Pestilences and Seven Afflictions, the *qi* of illnesses and epidemics, and the perils of myriad demons and specters. May their lives be preserved, free from harm. If your compassion is moved, I shall reverently receive this sacred grace.",

I now take pity on all beings as parents cherish their children. I shall now speak for you—listen carefully, hold fast to these words in your heart, and never forget my teaching.\"\n\nAt that moment, the assembly of sages rejoiced and, with single-minded devotion, prostrated in reverence.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"In the distant past, the people were simple and honest. They suffered no harm, their lifespans unfolding as destined. They fulfilled their natural years without premature death, and no ghosts inflicted wanton injury. But now, in this degenerate age of shallowness, the human heart is corrupted. The five emotions are in turmoil, giving rise to doubt and confusion. Deeds lack sincerity, and only perverse conduct is pursued. They turn from truth to embrace falsehood, forsaking righteousness and benevolence. They defy Heaven and rebel against Earth, severing roots and felling trunks. They are neither loyal nor filial, devoid of love and compassion. They deceive the multitudes and tyrannize the common folk. They slaughter living beings and destroy the lives of creatures, accumulating boundless transgressions and karmic enmity.\n\nThus, in this present life, calamities arise at every turn. Some are slain by bandits, others destroyed by malevolent ghosts. Some are harmed by venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or the stings of poisonous insects. Official and private disputes arise without cause, leading to imprisonment, flogging, or exile. Families may be struck by pestilence, bodies afflicted by toxic *qi*, great and small illnesses, or the death of kin, severing the six relations.\n\nAll such sufferings arise from the *qi* of the Six Heavens. The King of the Northern Feng, the Eight Divisions of Ghostly Masters, the Generals of the Dead in the human realm, and the Spirits of the Five Weapons roam the world, seizing upon transgressions to unleash their toxic *qi* and slay the wicked. Year after year, month after month, countless suffer these fates, entangled in one another’s doom, leading to death. The surviving people cannot escape such agonies—how grievous and pitiable!\"",

      "translated_text": "Each year, on the three days when the Dragon moves, the five days when the Horse halts, the seven days when the Pheasant flies, the nine days when the Dog establishes, and on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, perform the jiao rites with reverence, focusing the mind without distraction. Each morning, purify the heart and recite the divine incantations ten thousand times. Thus may merit be accomplished and responses manifest without delay.\n\nInstruct all future true disciples: if dwelling in the secular world, conduct the incense offerings and devotions in a subdued voice, avoiding loud recitation lest the gods and spirits be startled. Shun the polluting qi of birth and death. Whenever handling the scripture, first lift the prohibitions.\n\nThis Fengdu Divine Seal is the Dao of longevity and deathlessness. Thus it is placed within the Twelve Diagrams of the Lower Primordial’s Realm of Life, to suppress the baleful qi of the twelve years, months, and days, and to subdue the calamities of the twelve hours. If a nation practices this, the realm will know peace, all directions will submit, and the barbarians of the eight wilds will return to virtue. Should a land suffer disasters, incessant slaughter, or the sorrows of ruler and ministers, establish the Altar of the Seven Primordials, swiftly forge the seal, and hang it at the twelve earthly branches of the nation’s borders, within its astrological divisions. Morning and evening, burn incense and make offerings. The Perfected of the North will descend, and the divine seal’s transcendent immortals will transform into mighty deities—or fierce generals—to aid the state, dispelling the three disasters, averting punishments, halting warfare, and securing the land’s tranquility. Ruler and ministers will share prosperity, the myriad people will enjoy purity and fortune—all through the power of the divine seal.\n\nThe Northern Emperor says: If those born in the Lower Primordial cultivate this Dao of mine yet fail to witness its statutes, behold its scriptures, or prepare its talismans and seals, their hand gestures lack method, their recitations bear no merit, and they claim it yields no effect. They know not the wondrous Dao of immortals, for the matter lies in diligent cultivation. Daily progress in practice allows the gods and spirits to become familiar and mindful. Past transgressions are swept away, karmic offenses pardoned. The three obstacles gradually dissolve, the six senses become unobstructed. Above, one communes with numinous wisdom; below, one governs human relations. Summon, and they come at once—divine soldiers stand guard. Unceasing jiao rites ensure the Highest Sages take daily notice. Heal illnesses, dispel demons, and responses will follow the heart’s intent. Merit accomplished, the fruit of the Dao attained, one enters the realm of non-action.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor bestowed the divine incantations and seals upon the thirty myriad Mighty Divine Kings and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct. All the ghosts and spirits of the great earth, upon hearing this, universally submit. Those afflicted by stagnation and illness find relief; wronged souls achieve liberation.\n\nWhat is this scripture called? The Northern Emperor says: It is named *The Wondrous Scripture of the Fengdu Divine Seal of the Great Emperor*, harmonizing Heaven and pacifying Earth, delivering from the calamities of the Nine Yangs, prolonging life and aiding the imperiled. Let each receive and uphold it, and all true disciples practice it with devotion.\n\nThus concludes *The Fifth Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations*, spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Venerable.\n\n---\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Incantations Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Venerable*\nAlso named: *The Most High Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and Golden Register for Delivering Lives and Rescuing from the Nine Hells*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable was in the Wondrous Realm of the Nine Purities, within the Three Primordials Palace, seated upon a jeweled cloud and jade throne beneath the canopy of the Qianlin trees. Together with the Great Sages—the Most High Dao Lords, the Most High Lord Lao, the Nine August Perfected, the Flying Heavenly Great Sages, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the hosts of heavenly dragons, humans, and ghosts, an innumerable assembly—all gathered at once upon the jeweled terrace of kalpas. The multitudes from the ten directions arrived, riding five-colored jade wheels, eight-scene jasper chariots, dark numinous jade staves, flying cloud white canopies, unicorn-drawn feathered carriages, dragon banners and phoenix plumes, lions and white cranes. Their roars and songs resounded harmoniously as they burned incense, scattered flowers, soared through the void, and chanted the cavernous hymns, praising the Heavenly Venerable and collectively reviewing the registers to deliver all from suffering.\n\nThen, the Upper Palace of the Three Primordials radiated luminous brilliance, illuminating the vast emptiness. The Numinous Capital of the Purple Tenuity shone, casting its glow across the ten directions. Below, even the boundless realms and the eternal night of the Nine Hells of the netherworld were revealed. The roots of good and evil destinies gleamed within the light, and every mysterious office was illuminated. In every heavenly palace, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable and the great assembly were seen expounding the wondrous Dao, transforming humans and gods, marking meritorious deeds, and inscribing names in the Yellow Registers, golden tablets, and jade slips, arrayed before the Three Clarities.\n\nWithin each hell, the Ten Directions’ Savior Heavenly Venerables were seen entering the Nine Hells to deliver all from suffering. They commanded the Northern Emperor, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the hundred-twenty departments, the Five Emperor Examiners, the Life-Inspecting Lads, the Recorders of Life and Deeds, the Controllers of Merit and Execution, the Nine Mounds of the Earth Sovereign, the Four Luminous Lords and their retinues, the officials of the Five Peaks, the divine soldiers enforcing punishments, the mighty heavenly warriors, the heavenly couriers and armored troops, the Ox-Head jailers, the Mighty Sword Divine Kings, the great demons of the Three Realms, and the nine hundred million ghost kings—all gathered in the Nine Hells of the netherworld to receive the teachings and precepts.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor of Fengdu and all the ghost officials trembled in awe, each thinking: \"We have accumulated sins and become ghost officials, governing the netherworld, dwelling in darkness for kalpas without end, never beholding light. What karmic cause brings us today to suddenly witness the august radiance of the Highest Sages illuminating the profound gloom? We wish to inquire but hesitate in doubt.\"\n\nAt that time, within the prisons of universal torment, all the sinners whose names were inscribed in the Black Registers were driven by the Ox-Head jailers onto the Mountain of Knives. Their heads and bodies were shattered, their limbs scattered. Yet among them, one man alone ascended and descended the mountain, following the trees’ heights, treading upon blades and edges without a single wound. All the swords and halberds transformed into lotus flowers.\n\nThen, the Northern Emperor was greatly alarmed. He bowed his head in reverence and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"Your disciple, by past karma, was unfortunate to assume office in the netherworld, dwelling in Fengdu for kalpas uncounted. I have repeatedly witnessed sinners enduring myriad torments. I have also seen the Eastern Prison of Wind and Thunder, where black winds, crashing thunder, and lightning bolts hurl flying spears and drifting halberds, piercing sinners’ bodies, scattering their limbs, and rending their viscera. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffer without respite, day or night.\"",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, he beheld the Southern Prison of Blazing Obscurity, where multitudes of sinners swallowed fire and devoured coals, scorched by flames. Their faces and heads were charred, fire-mountains crowned their skulls, and from their skin, bones, and flesh, flames erupted joint by joint. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe further witnessed the Western Prison of Diamond, where sinners endured countless beatings with iron hammers and metal rods. Their limbs rotted and disintegrated, their sinews and bones scattered. Iron forks pierced their bellies, and golden hammers lodged in their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without pause, day or night.\n\nHe also saw the Northern Prison of Freezing Cold, where sinners sank into pools of frigid mire. Ice-spears and frost-blades severed their sinews and bones, while vats of venomous brew were poured upon them. Their bodies fell apart, their hearts and viscera ruptured. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nThen he observed the Central Prison of Universal Torment, where sinners endured unbearable agony under relentless torture. Their sinews snapped, blood flowed, and they collapsed in swoons. Thereupon, the wardens impaled them with iron forks, compelling them to ascend the mountains of blades and forests of swords. Black winds from all directions swayed the trees, causing their feet to slip onto the knife-mountains and their bodies to hang upon the sword-edges. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without cease, day or night.\n\nHe further beheld the Southeastern Prison of Bronze Pillars, where sinners embraced and climbed the pillars, their outer and inner flesh scorched and rotted. Their sinews and bones fell apart, their backs and bellies festered with pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe also saw the Southwestern Prison of Butchery, where sinners were suspended upside down while blades carved their bodies. Their limbs, sinews, skin, and viscera were all sliced by knives, blood pooling upon the ground in unbearable torment. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without pause, day or night.\n\nMoreover, he witnessed the Northwestern Prison of Fire Chariots, where sinners were torn asunder by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some were cast amid the fire chariots, each wheel lined with blades that, as they turned, sliced their bodies. Fierce flames roasted them to charred ruin. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without respite, day or night.\n\nHe further beheld the Northeastern Prison of Boiling Cauldrons, where sinners were impaled by iron forks and plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid. Their bodies were steeped and cooked, their limbs dissolved into pus and blood, the stench unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they suffered without cease, day or night.\n\nThe Northern Emperor then inquired: \"By what karmic cause does this one sinner alone ascend and descend the mountains of blades and forests of swords unscathed, the spears and halberds transforming into lotus flowers? His countenance is majestic, his steps fearless, and though myriad torments assail him, none can harm him.\"\n\nSuddenly, the Heavenly Venerable turned his chariot, and the Perfected Ones descended in assembly. All trembled in awe, uncertain of what was to come.\n\nThe Northern Emperor entreated: \"May the Heavenly Venerable, in his great compassion and mercy, universally save and deliver all beings suffering in the Nine Dark Realms. May their sins be eradicated, their past lives recalled, and may they forsake evil to embrace goodness. May they escape the Nine Dark Realms, dwell in radiance, and through the wheel of blessed retribution, attain lasting liberation, forever departing the Three Wretched Paths.\"\n\nAt that moment, the multitudes of the Nine Dark Hells, hearing the Northern Emperor’s earnest plea, awakened to remorse and yearned for absolution. Their cries of sorrow resounded, shaking the Brahma-heavens.\n\nThen, the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, moved by boundless compassion, surveyed all with their salvific light. Through the power of the Six Penetrations, they bade the sinners close their eyes and meditate in stillness. In an instant, each recalled their past lives and understood their deeds.\n\nIn their former existences, they had committed myriad evils:\nSome had murdered their lords or fathers, or been unfilial to their parents.\nSome had slandered the Great Dao, turning from truth to falsehood.\nSome had harmed their brothers or plotted against their masters.\nSome, with their kin, had committed incest.\nSome had been bandits, taking lives.\nSome had slaughtered beings to indulge their own flesh.\nSome had oppressed the weak with strength or abused the lowly with power.\nSome had feigned devotion to the Three Treasures while their hearts wavered.\nSome had disdained Dharma-teachers or defiled sacred scriptures.\nSome had harbored malice, cruelty, or jealousy.\nSome had wielded vicious tongues, sowing discord among the virtuous.\nSome had killed living beings in licentious rites or exposed the Three Luminaries to shame.\nWhether by thought, word, or deed—whether self-committed or taught to others—\nall sins accumulated over kalpas were suddenly realized, each clearly understood.\n\nTheir sorrow redoubled, and they yearned for liberation.\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable addressed the four assemblies: \"Listen well. These sinners, for countless kalpas, have disbelieved the scriptures and teachings, persisting only in evil. Sin upon sin has bound them, their transgressions complete and their fates sealed. Thus, their names were inscribed in the Black Register, their bodies cast into the Nine Dark Realms, sunk in the Three Wretched Paths, with no hope of deliverance.\n\nYet among them was this one who, in life, had established the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, upheld the Golden Register and White Petitions, and observed the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts. His name was inscribed in the Golden Ledger and recorded in the Jade Clarity. His virtue was profound, his merit lofty, and his name known in the Upper Realms.

This is also called the *Six Heavens’ Strategic Text*. Inscribe the deceased’s name in cinnabar and black ink beside it, then refine it in searing flames—thus shall this realm loose its bonds, the Three Offices pardon transgressions, and the soul ascend to the Hall of Blessings. Carve it in stone and erect it at the tomb palace, and suffering souls shall receive deliverance, their names recorded in the Vermilion Numinous Court. Let scholars wear it upon their person or place it above the hall’s chambers, and ten thousand ghosts shall vanish without trace, while the hidden springs of darkness open to prosperity.\n\nThis text is inscribed at the Northern Gate of Supreme Clarity, governing the division of the Six Swords, as recorded in the *Scripture of the Primordial Six Heavens’ Subjugation of Demons*.\n\nIts eulogy says:\nThe True Form of Fengdu,\nText of Supreme Clarity.\nCultivating immortals,\nWear it to subdue demonic essence.\nThe Three Offices bestow blessings,\nSeven ancestors receive rebirth.\nBlack ledgers erased,\nRefined and delivered to the Vermilion Numinous Court.\nMight and spirit silently guard,\nAttaining the Dao’s fulfillment.\nThe *Six Heavens’ Strategic Text*,\nSecures the home and brings prosperity.\n\nThe *Sweet Dew Communion with Perfection Incantation* says:\nVirtue’s golden radiance,\nGently opens the gates of darkness.\nThe Flower Pool flows with true fragrance,\nLotus canopies drift upon the clouds.\nA thousand spirits harmonize primordial unity,\nEver dwelling in the Twelve Towers.\nHasten to proclaim the Lingbao decree,\nAnd wander freely in the celestial halls.\n\nThis is called the *Divine Incantation Breaking Hell’s Bonds and Communing with Perfection*, a secret and wondrous utterance proclaimed by the Golden Mouth of the Most High. If one recites it, the gates of hell shall open, locks shall fall away of themselves, the Nine Dark Realms shall cease their trials, and the Six Paths shall halt their turning. Suffering souls shall receive rebirth, and forebears shall ascend in deliverance.\n\nThe *Incantation Purifying Fengdu’s Hell and Ascending to Heaven* says:\nVast and boundless, within Fengdu,\nLayer upon layer, the Vajra Mountains stand.\nThe boundless radiance of Lingbao,\nIllumines the scorching pools of affliction.\nThe seven ancestors and all hidden souls,\nTheir forms follow the fragrant cloud-banners.\nWith the blue lotus of concentration and wisdom,\nThey ascend to the divine, forever at peace.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declares: If the imprisoned souls of hell hear even the name of this divine incantation, they shall naturally rejoice and attain the path to heaven. These two divine incantations are from the *Sweet Dew Divine Incantations Scripture of Ascending from Hell to Heaven*.\n\n**The True Form of Mount Fengdu**\nIf you receive and uphold the Golden Register, the White Petition, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit, and the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering, you shall dissolve the great sins of the Nine Dark Realms and inscribe your name in the Nine Palaces. The Youth Who Surveys Destiny shall guard the precepts, the Mighty Spirits and the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the clerks of the Six Palaces shall follow the petition’s text, sheltering and protecting the disciples who receive the precepts.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy further declares: If in any land war ceases not and pestilence spreads, let its ruler, queen, crown prince, nobles, and all common people establish the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, each receiving the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and the Golden Register’s sacred talismans. War shall quiet, malevolent forces shall withdraw, heaven and humanity shall rejoice, and the land shall know great peace.\n\nIf in mountains or wilds you are beset by tigers, wolves, or fierce beasts, calm your heart and visualize the Golden Petition’s talisman, the Youth Who Surveys Destiny, the Precept Master, and the Dharma-Protecting Divine Kings. The beasts shall retreat of themselves and never harm you.\n\nIf upon the great sea you encounter fierce winds, visualize the stilling of waves and storms, and you shall reach the shore.\n\nIf amid the blades of battle you stand, visualize weapons vanishing, and you shall suffer no harm.\n\nIf imprisoned in shackles and bonds, visualize your grievances redressed, and you shall surely be freed.\n\nIf afflicted by demonic spirits or manifold sufferings, visualize malevolent ghosts vanishing, and you shall naturally recover.\n\nIf one has passed away and is bound for the Nine Dark Realms, their name inscribed in the Black Ledger, let their spouse, children, disciples, and fellow students establish the Great Fast of the Nine Dark Realms, inscribe their name on a White Petition, receive the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, and burn away the Black Ledger. Those sinful souls shall be instantly released, ascend through the Celestial Gate, and through the turning of karmic conditions, become Perfected of the Nine Palaces.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy further declares: The wondrous precepts of the Golden Register and the Talisman of Longevity for the Spirit bear the weightiest of prohibitions. If cultivated in accordance with the method, their blessings shall be boundless. Yet if one harbors doubt and slander, fostering thoughts of contempt, know that such a person accumulates evil across ten thousand kalpas, their sins profound and heavy, their name inscribed in the Black Ledger, their body consigned to the demonic officials. After death, they shall inevitably sink into the Nine Dark Hells of Fengdu, enduring every torment through endless nights, never to be freed.\n\nShould one initially believe and receive, only to later regret, the Youth Who Surveys Destiny shall report to the Three Offices, erase their name from the Golden Petition, and inscribe it in the Ledger of Death. In this life, they may suffer malignant diseases—worms, leprosy, ulcers, and abscesses—abandoned by all, unable to live yet unable to die, tormented by their own anguish, with no escape. Or they may long endure misfortune: falling victim to violence, violating the king’s law, perishing by blade or beast, drowning in water or burning in fire, cursed by evil tongues, discord in the household, strife at the gate, or entanglement with enemies. Once having lost the true Dao, they shall forever sink into evil destinies.\n\nTherefore, follow the regulations and uphold them without deviant thoughts. Proclaim this to all men and women, that all may hear and know.\n\nAt that time, the Northern Emperor and all the four assemblies, along with the sinful souls of the Nine Dark Realms, hearing these words, their spirits awakened and minds enlightened, each aroused good intentions. Their manifold sufferings dissolved, their bodies and minds at peace, they turned their backs on the cycles of rebirth and forever embraced the Dao.\n\nAt that moment, the Black Ledgers of the Nine Dark Realms were all consumed in flames. The flames of Fire Mountain subsided, the waves of the Water Prison stilled. Those who swallowed fire and ate coals were transformed into sweet dew. Golden hammers and iron staves became lotus blossoms. Walking upon the void, they chanted in praise:\n\nWe bow our heads to the Supreme Dao,\nOur hearts return to the Primordial Worthy.",

It was the fifteenth day of the month of Everlasting Spring, when the bright star shone resplendent. Before him, the various Heavenly Emperors, the Eight Mighty Spirit Kings, the multitudes of earthly spirits, immortal men and women, divine men and women, the immortals of the Nine Palaces, and the hosts of flying immortals all prostrated themselves, kneeling in reverence to gaze upon his sacred countenance.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy remained silent, uttering not a word. Closing his eyes in tranquil contemplation, he reflected upon the boundless beings of the ten directions, mired in ignorance and darkness, unaware of the true and correct Dao. They commit manifold evil deeds, drowning in the river of birth and death, drifting through the Five Paths. Oppressed by extreme suffering, who among them can awaken to the truth? Only I know.\n\nHaving thus pondered, he once more clicked his teeth. Unbeknownst to him, the Northern Emperor, sensing the power of the Dao, perceived his thoughts. From the summit of the Dark Mound in the north, he arrived with his divine retinue, riding the void, and approached the Heavenly Worthy. With utmost reverence, he bowed and addressed him, saying: \"Most Sagely One, your compassionate transformation pities the suffering of heaven and humanity, enduring calamities and hardships. You broadly extend salvation. The heavens rejoice, auspicious clouds arise. The hells are freed from grievances, and the heavens bear the joy of renewed life. Demons and malevolent spirits are banished, the Six Caves sealed. The children of heaven and earth universally receive profound grace. Yet you also reflect upon those oppressed by poverty and hardship, afflicted by hunger, cold, sorrow, and grief. We do not know, Most Sagely One, by what means you will save and deliver them. If you deign to grant succor, the heavens will be ever grateful.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"What you now request is that in heaven and earth, the poor and rich may be made equal, without distinction. I shall now expound this for you. The establishment of heaven and earth arises from non-action. The coalescence of qi and the condensation of the void are the result of my teachings. The length of one’s predestined life and the causes of attaining the Dao—those whose names are inscribed in the Registers of the Upper Birth proceed to the Palace of Southern Prosperity. Those who seek to avert disasters and attain honor and emolument turn to the Northern Dipper. Those pursued by the ledgers belong to the offices of the Three Officials. Those who obtain wealth and treasures must seek the Nine Saints and Five Dragons. I shall now expound this; may each of you receive and uphold it.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Within the Four Heavens, there are the wondrous names of the Nine Dragons. They bestow blessings upon official emoluments, ensure the fertility of the land, prevent disasters, grant the fulfillment of prayers, and ward off all depletion, bringing daily prosperity and abundance.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Dragons leave no trace, for they arise through the Dao. As the majestic spirits of the Heavenly Emperor, they guard the stipends of the world’s people—this is their trust. I now proclaim to the great assembly: If a land suffers calamities, its five grains do not flourish, and its people endure poverty, hardship, and insufficient clothing and food; if its officials stagnate in rank, their worries unending, and all their desires unfulfilled, their reputations and careers unprosperous—those who seek benefit should first establish my image, set up the altars of the Three Officials, and construct the platform of the Nine Dragons. At dawn, noon, and dusk, they should burn incense and perform the Daoist rites. By reverently reciting the names of the Nine Dragons and summoning the Dragon Kings of the Five Directions, concentrating their thoughts upon the Northern Culmen, the celestial talismans will descend, and the Dragon Kings will arrive. Receiving their sincere devotion, the Dragon Kings will command the spirits of the Five Lands to widely bestow benefits, dispatching the treasures of the Five Directions to descend upon the realm. The land will flourish abundantly, and all wishes will be fulfilled. Those of utmost sincerity will immediately receive their blessings.\"\n\nThe Dao declares: The Azure Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the East—Horn and Neck—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the Azure Flower Palace, it transforms into the Auspicious Cultivation Dragon King and the Deep Forest Dragon King, presiding over the azure treasures and the various subterranean riches, guarding the azure robes and official emoluments of the world. If one in the world finds their aspirations unfulfilled, suffering poverty and fleeing calamity, they should establish an altar, burn incense, depict the dragon’s form, and prostrate in worship. Reciting the scripture for three days and nights, or seven days and nights, maintaining purity and invoking the dragon, they can summon the azure treasures of the Infinite World of the East and the azure robes and official emoluments into their body. This will dispel the calamities of the Eastern Wood Star, the misfortunes of violent disasters, and the True Official of the Year Star will inscribe their name in the registers, bringing wealth and nobility.\n\nThe Vermilion Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the South—Well and Ghost—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the Palace of Longevity, it transforms into the Many Virtues Dragon King and the Flower Remaining Dragon King, presiding over the vermilion treasures and the various subterranean riches, guarding the vermilion robes and official emoluments of the world. If one in the world encounters misfortunes, their official rank stagnant and the seven treasures ungathered, they should establish an altar, burn incense, make offerings, and prostrate in worship to seek their wishes. This will summon the vermilion treasures of the Infinite World of the South and the vermilion robes and official emoluments into their body, dispelling fire disasters and the sorrows of slander. They will enjoy peace in this life and their blessings will flourish.\n\nThe White Dragon is the essence of the Seven Mansions of the West—Straddler and Stomach—descending to the human realm to protect the land. Within the White Cloud Palace, it transforms into the Sweet Grace Dragon King and the Virtuous Serenity Dragon King, presiding over the white treasures and bestowing the white robes and official emoluments of the world, governing the seven subterranean treasures. If one in the world finds their aspirations unfulfilled, their reputation and career unrealized, and both public and private affairs obstructed, they should establish an altar, burn incense, offer water, prostrate in worship, and make invocations. This will summon the white treasures of the Infinite World of the West and the white robes and official emoluments to descend into their body, dispelling the misfortunes of depletion and curses, widely benefiting the land, ensuring abundant harvests of the five grains, and bringing peace to the mind and spirit. Both public and private affairs will prosper, and blessings and emoluments will be renewed.",

      "translated_text": "The Black Dragon is the essence of the northern seven lodges, Dipper and Ox, descending to the human realm to protect and sustain the land. Within the Palace of Great Yin, it transforms into the Dragon Kings Poliu and Sidu, presiding over the black treasures and bestowing the black robes and official emoluments of the world, governing the ways of ships and vessels. If one in the world finds their aspirations thwarted and their long-held wishes unfulfilled, they should establish an altar and prostrate in worship. This will summon the black treasures of the Infinite World of the North and the black robes and official emoluments to descend into their body, dispelling the misfortunes of water disasters, shipwrecks, and carriage accidents, and ensuring the land’s abundant harvest.\n\nThe Yellow Dragon is the essence of the central seven lodges, descending to the human realm to protect and sustain the land. Within the Palace of High August Heaven, it transforms into the Dragon King of the Detached Palace, presiding over the yellow treasures and the five directional treasuries’ riches, providing the myriad people with clothing, food, and official emoluments. It dwells within the chambers of human residences and the treasure caves of famous mountains. If one in the world seeks to attain blessings and emoluments as they desire, they should establish an altar and offer devout prayers. This will summon the yellow treasures and official emoluments from the subterranean palace of the Central Earth Emperor to enter their body, causing their livelihood to flourish daily, their nobility to reach the royal throne, and all their wishes to be fulfilled. It will dispel the misfortunes of the five viscera’s hundred ailments and the calamities of the five stars’ influence upon fate. When the Star of Stability inscribes their name in the register, blessings will arise within them.\n\nThe Dao states: These Five Directional Dragon Kings excellently stabilize the land. Moreover, the Nine Dragons excellently guard the treasures, transforming and manifesting across the five directions. If a land’s five grains do not flourish, its people suffer famine, its royal taxes remain unmet, and its people flee to the mountains and valleys, filling the roads with cries of resentment, those who seek peace should establish a Nine Dragons ritual arena, recite scriptures, and perform the Daoist circumambulation. Heaven will send sweet dew, the hungry will be sated, the five grains will ripen early, flowers and fruits will bear flavor, and famine will be averted, sparing lives from untimely death—all through the power of the Dragon Kings.\n\nThe Dao states: If the lands under the jurisdiction of various states experience omens both auspicious and inauspicious, the five grains fail to propagate, and the people suffer famine, one may inscribe the names of the Nine Dragons on tablets of jasper, gold, and ivory. On the days of the Three Origins, these tablets should be driven into the earth to a depth of one foot and two inches, aligned with the five directions of the respective lands. Thus, the divine dragons will be pacified and anchored. Offerings of incense and flowers should be made at each position. After seven days, the Dragon King of the Black Palace, along with the Great Generals of the Northern Emperor, will journey to the Vermilion Brightness Palace to open the treasure vaults, transport the implements of the Seven Perfected, and proceed to the left valley of Goat Mountain to retrieve the five grains. Bringing these to the afflicted land, they will provide relief, allowing both heaven and humanity to enjoy abundance and dispelling all sorrows.\n\nThe Dao states: If the men and women of a land are born in years governed by the Ominous Star or ill-omened lodges, under the Five Graves or Four Cuts, their fate will not prosper, and they will encounter depletion and loss, lacking sufficient clothing and food. Anxious day and night, nothing will go as they wish. Those who seek blessings should establish an altar and devoutly recite the true forms of the Nine Dragons. On the twenty-sixth day of each month, they should burn incense, offer water, wear the true talismans of the Nine Dragons, and carry the Great Register of the Five Dragons. With sincere devotion and focused intent, the dragons will descend with heavenly might into their homes, granting their desires and bringing immediate benefit.\n\nThe Dao states: If the regional lords, governors, and magistrates of a land—from the two-thousand-bushel officials down to the district chiefs—wish to attain high official rank, remain free from disasters, enforce prohibitions effectively, and avoid disputes and litigation, they may inscribe the names of the Nine Dragons on ivory. On the day of Blessing’s Birth, they should stand it in the east, place it in a five-colored bag, and hold it with utmost sincerity. In their sleeping chambers, on the days of the lunar phases each month, they should offer rare flowers, exotic fruits, and pure water. The Dragon Kings will descend, their divine power protecting the people, aiding the royal transformation, and ensuring promotions and emoluments.\n\nThe Dao states: The ghosts of the Five Depletions are surnamed Lang and named Sengwen. The ghosts of the Six Losses are surnamed Huang and named Yuangai. Each year, they cause people’s depletion and loss, impoverishing them, obstructing their paths, and dissipating their wealth. However, by reciting the wondrous scripture of the Nine Dragons, making offerings, and prostrating in worship, and by transmitting the true talismans, these ghosts will be unable to harass them, and the ghosts of depletion and loss will instead assist in bringing blessings.\n\nThe Dao states: The Five Dragons and Nine Sages I have spoken of pacify and anchor the five directions and the nine palaces’ respective lands. Why is this so? The Dragon Kings govern the nine heavens above and stabilize the nine earths below, wielding the numinous power of the immortals’ officials. Ascending to heaven and entering the earth, they convey messages and bear radiant hues. Emerging from obscurity and penetrating the subtle, they live for ten thousand years, their essence attuned to the supreme Dao. If there are those in the world who possess divine insight and sagely wisdom, who cultivate truth and awaken to the Dao, as well as kings, great ministers, and those engaged in military campaigns, all may invoke the divine dragons for assistance and achieve victory.\n\nTheir forms arise from the formless, all endowed with numinosity. The myriad things of heaven and earth all arise through the Dao’s methods, establishing teachings and verifying them. The Dao Lord addressed the Northern Emperor, saying: Among the sagely beings of form, none surpass the dragon. It can summon rain and raise clouds, moving heaven and earth. It excellently guards treasures, spitting forth precious pearls of langgan. It bestows things upon humanity and safeguards the linked-ring treasure pearls. In the rivers, lakes, and grottoes, it amasses luminous moon pearls. Within the dragon palaces’ inner halls lie priceless lustrous pearls—marvels beyond description. Thus, it protects households and stabilizes nations. If one recites and upholds this wondrous scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Nine Dragons, establishing rituals and practicing the Dao, all within the land who suffer illness will be healed. Gold and silver will well forth, the eight sufferings will cease, all virtues will harmonize, and the Dharma’s sound will spread far. None will fail to obtain blessings; the lands will rejoice, and all will realize the formless.\n\nYou have not yet heard this; it is essential to propagate it.\n\nThe Dao states: If those born in the Lower Origin dwell in homes plagued by depletion and misfortune, their residences unsettled and disasters and illnesses frequent, they may establish a Five Dragons ritual arena. Morning and evening, at the three periods of the day, they should recite scriptures and perform the Daoist circumambulation. Then, immortal officials will descend, and the Eight Trigrams’ great spirits, the Virtue of the Moon, the Six Harmonies, and the Five Dragon Kings will be commanded.",

Both public and private affairs will prosper, and blessings and emoluments will be renewed.",

      "translated_text": "Entering their dwellings, it dispels depletion and misfortune, driving away malevolent spirits. It stabilizes palaces and chambers, safeguarding the household and ensuring descendants thrive. It broadly attracts official emoluments, drawing five-colored treasures into the home. For generations, there shall be peace and harmony, boundless wealth and nobility.\n\nThe Dao states: The Nine Dragons True Talisman brings official rank and emoluments, enabling one to attain wealth and nobility, with all wishes fulfilled. Those who carry this text shall remain untouched by disasters, respected by both officials and commoners. This talisman is accompanied by nine dragon spirits as officials, twelve jade maidens, eighty thousand generals of the Six Jia, six divine youths, and the Great General of the Northern Emperor, who constantly come to guard and protect. Above, it dispels celestial calamities; below, it scatters terrestrial misfortunes—no wish shall go unfulfilled. Without sincere reverence, it must not be recklessly transmitted.\n\nThereupon, the assembly of immortals offered this hymn:\n\nDragons transform without trace,\nYet their marks give rise to the Dao’s lineage.\nRoaming the nine heavens’ bounds,\nThey rest their chariots in the six peaks’ halls.\nThey uplift the loftiest guests,\nAnd join with our pure spirits in harmony.\nWithin the empty stillness of the ritual arena,\nDivine songs resound through the vast sky.\nForms perceive the tranquil court,\nThoughts chant, subtly connecting.\nDragon chants govern the offices,\nPhoenix cries echo in the celestial halls.\nSpiritual hymns leave no lingering taste,\nAll sounds disperse upon the wind.\nWho can rescue this chapter?\nThrough earnest recitation, praise the pure spirits’ ode,\nTo absolve the three paths’ transgressions,\nAnd extricate from the nine mysteries’ trials.\nWith reverence, pay homage to the Great Void,\nWhere blessings ascend beyond the heavens.\nNine dragons reflect the luminous pearl,\nTwo radiant essences face the true light.\nClouds soar in soaring assemblies,\nCelestial signs and the Fusang tree appear.\nHidden blessings mutually sustain,\nYin and yang illuminate the eight wilds.\nThe five stars shine brilliantly,\nDivine dragons unfold the cosmic order.\nIf one cultivates the utmost Dao,\nFreely they enter the Purple Realm.\n\nThe Dao Lord addressed the Northern Emperor, saying: This Nine Dragons Wondrous Canon is not to be transmitted to the unworthy. If a household possesses this scripture, it will attract treasures and priceless luminous pearls. I exhort all true disciples to reflect upon it earnestly. Broadly cultivate the utmost Dao, guiding those lost on the path. When merit is accomplished and virtue perfected, ascend into the formless. With profound virtue deepened, be born in the Southern Supreme Palace, free from all perverse realms. Your ears shall hear wondrous sounds, your feet shall ride the five-colored clouds. Your mouth shall feast on sweet dew, and your transformations shall be boundless.\n\nAt that time, the great assembly, having heard the Nine Dragons Wondrous Canon and the origins of the Five Directions’ Dragon Kings, each rejoiced with refined delight. Throughout all worlds, the seven treasures welled forth, sparing all from hunger and want. The six directions were purified, the heavens free from defilement, and the five grains abundant. The assembly of perfected beings bowed in reverence and transmitted the teachings for practice.\n\nThus concludes the seventh scroll of *The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*.\n\n---\n\n**Section on the Register for Expelling Corpses**\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: Those born in the Lower Origin, with shallow karmic cultivation in past lives, endure many hardships in this world. Now, as the Yang Nine cycle turns and the Hundred Six count concludes, ghostly spirits roam chaotically, invading and disturbing the earth, where good and evil are indistinguishable. The Most High, in his compassion, revealed the *Secret Register of the Abyssal Cavern* and divine incantations to eliminate misfortune. Yet some root causes remain unexhausted, daring to lurk within bamboo, wood, water, and stone, harming the myriad people. Whether afflicted by *wangliang* spirits, perverse gods, the Five Maladies, or a hundred poisons, or whether entering battle and wrongfully losing their lives, I now issue this luminous teaching, wondrous talismans, and true diagrams to instruct all future true disciples. On days of calamity, transmit these with utmost sincerity to protect the people. Inscribe them on white silk, wear and venerate them—all perverse forces shall retreat, battles shall be won, households shall be tranquil, corpses shall be repelled for a thousand *li*, grievances shall cease, and good wishes shall be fulfilled as the heart desires.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The recipient shall recite these words: \"I, a humble subject of [such-and-such] kingdom, [such-and-such] official [so-and-so], respectfully present ritual offerings to the gate of the Heavenly Master, requesting to receive the Northern Emperor’s divine incantations and flying talismans. Under the governance of the Northern Dipper’s [such-and-such] Star Lord, may the Northern Dipper’s great spirits follow this humble subject [so-and-so]. Subdue ghosts, dispel demons, and grant peace in this life, tranquility for household and kingdom, with the Great Emperor’s protection. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: This talismanic diagram is constantly attended by sixteen divisions of the Northern Emperor’s great officers, one hundred twenty divine incantation generals, who ever shield those who wear it. They cause all perverse forces to scatter and submit, prolonging years and increasing destiny, eternally preserving primordial auspiciousness. If one enters battle wearing this text, weapons shall retreat, sparing them from the calamity of bloodshed and the eight difficulties.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those born in the Lower Origin afflicted with lingering illness, whose souls are unsettled, beset by a hundred specters over years and months, they must kowtow and receive the *Luminous Register of the Supreme Tenuity Emperor Lord*. Wear it upon the body—ghostly spirits shall retreat, all illnesses shall vanish, years shall be prolonged, and life preserved. These are the secret divine methods.\n\n**Talismanic Diagram and Imagery**\nOne Jade Maiden of the Luminous Mirror, one Jade Maiden of Life Preservation, one Jade Maiden of Life Administration, one Jade Maiden of Yellow Silk, one Jade Maiden of the Azure Waist.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: These five women shall strike names from the ledger of death. The Lord of the Eastern Dipper governs destiny, prolonging life and increasing years. The True Person Lord of the Southern Dipper inscribes eternal life in the Jade Calendar. The Lord of the Western Dipper records names, inscribing blessings and emoluments. The Star Sovereign of the Northern Dipper erases names from death’s roster. The Supreme Tenuity Lord of the Central Dipper averts calamities, dispelling all misfortunes, ensuring peace in one’s dwelling and the vanishing of ghostly *qi*. Should any defiantly oppose this Dao, they shall be seized and consigned beneath the *Kuigang*, plunged ten thousand *zhang* into the earth. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: I issue this Dao to save the world and pacify its people. When the world is purified and at peace, merit shall be accomplished and the Dao fulfilled. At that time, the Heavenly Worthy, within the Inconceivable City, gazed afar upon the Northern Emperor, broadly disseminating talismans and diagrams to save and protect the earth. He emitted radiant light, universally illuminating all heavens, even to the boundless worlds below.",

It pierced through the boundless lands below, even to the Three Wicked Paths and the Nine Dark Hells, all of which were illumined, bright and immaculate. The torments of hell ceased, and karmic retribution paused. The deaf, the blind, and the sixfold afflictions—all suffering was dispelled and healed. Men and beasts, birds and creatures, universally awakened to benevolence, no longer harming one another. By virtue of this radiance, all beings beheld with their whole bodies the Inconceivable City from afar, as though gazing into their own palms, none left unseen. Those who witnessed this light were destined to ascend to the Hall of Longevity and Bliss, entering the Jeweled City, where joy knows no end.\n\nWhat I now expound, all the Heavenly Worthies—past, present, and future—share in one mind and power. The dust-mote realms of the ten directions, all their Dharma Kings, together proclaim the subtle and wondrous meaning, the supreme sutra of the One Vehicle. Should even one person hear but a single chapter or verse, vowing to uphold and recite it for future ages—such a virtuous man or woman, wherever they tread, shall be untouched by calamity or illness. If one concentrates the mind, the Five Poisons shall be utterly dispelled. Again, I reveal the true meaning, the wondrous causes of practice: the perfected attain the Dharma, perceiving the body as utterly empty. Suffering and joy are not two, hatred and love share a single cause. High and low are not distinct, great and small differ not in form. The sun’s rising is not its first union, nor its setting its final demise. East and west are fundamentally unfixed; rising and setting know no direction.\n\nFurther, it was asked: by what cause did the Celestial August One bestow grace? At that time, the Northern Emperor proclaimed this subtle and wondrous talisman, addressing all virtuous men and women of future generations: in days of sorrow, practice tirelessly, wear my talismanic script, and ten thousand calamities shall vanish. With reverence and faith, devote yourself wholeheartedly to its observance.\n\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*, as Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Volume Eight—Concluded.\nThe *Supreme Scripture of the Northern Emperor’s Divine Incantations for Subduing Demons*, as Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy, Volume Nine: The Eight-Character Disaster-Dispelling Chapter.\n\nThe Dark Sovereign of the Northern Palace, the Black Emperor Spirit Lord, then addressed Marshal Tianpeng, the Ninefold Yuan Slayer Youths, the hosts of the Upper Clarity Yu-Yu Heaven, the Great Red Heaven, the Pure Tenuity Heaven, the Great Slayer Divine Multitudes—hundreds of millions strong—the Six Ding Great Spirits, the Six Jia Jade Maidens, the High Diao Northern Elder, the Three Slayer Spirit Kings, the Perfected of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Generals of the Samādhi for Driving Away Evil, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, the Great Spirits of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the River and Sea Deities, the Three Heavenly Demon Kings, the Divine Kings of the Mighty Sword of the Kui-Dragon Chariot, the Great Spirit Slayer of Ghosts, the Edict of Lady Qing, the Great Spirits of the Right Division, the Twenty-Four Great Spirits Who Devour Demons and Consume Ghosts, the Four-Eyed Elder, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Six Ding and Eight Scribes, the Divine Soldiers of the Five Directions and Five Emperors—thirty million strong—the Four Illuminating Merit Officers, the Three Thousand Six Hundred Messengers for Communicating with the Real, the Black Slayer Great Soldiers, the Multitudes of the Nine Lands, and all the hosts of mountains, rivers, streams, and ravines.\n\nThe Emperor declared: I now wish to broadly proclaim this essential Dharma to save the celestial and human realms, severing their groans and agonies. Hearken well, all of you.\n\nAt that moment, the assembled divine officials, hearing the Emperor’s intent to reveal the wondrous scripture, rejoiced as one, wholeheartedly submitting in devotion.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The secret arts of the Northern Palace are not lightly disclosed. They heal illness, avert calamity, pacify households, and secure the realm. I know the people of the Lower Realm suffer deeply, their agonies unbearable. Unable to bear the sight of their ignorance and deafness, I now resolve to enact their salvation.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: The Eight-Character Spirit Script is treasured in the Upper Palace. Through ten thousand kalpas, it has not been transmitted—such is its divine secrecy. Yet I see the ignorant and vulgar of the Lower Realm endure grievous suffering. Were I not to bestow it, they would wither without escape. Now I entrust it to you, that you may accumulate merit and treasure it. In times of calamity, practice it according to the method. Deliver the celestial and human realms, sparing them from sorrow and peril.\n\nUpon hearing the Emperor’s intent to proclaim the Eight Characters, the entire assembly prostrated themselves, five limbs to the earth, and joyfully recited this verse:\n*The sagely Emperor’s grace flows wide,*\n*Broadly opening the golden oral transmission.*\n*To save the people of the Lower Realm,*\n*Let their sufferings be utterly dispelled.*\n\nThe assembly, hearing the Dharma sound, rejoiced with every limb. The deaf regained hearing, the mute could speak. On that day, the Six Palaces trembled, and evil demons knew their fate. The great radiance was bestowed, and deep gloom met the bright sun.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: Perfected disciples here present, if you wish to practice my Eight-Character Spirit Script, face north and bow twice. I shall witness your sincere devotion.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For those among the Lower Realm’s people afflicted with internal illness, write the characters in ink, swallow one with water, and recite the divine incantation. Upon reaching the eighth character, the illness shall disperse. For external afflictions, calmly invoke the divine power, write the characters in ink upon the flesh, beginning with the first. If it does not disperse, write the second beside it. In most cases, no more than three characters are needed for the illness to retreat. Remember this well, perfected disciples, and uphold it.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: For men and women of the Lower Realm whose livelihoods falter, who suffer poverty and hardship, are assailed by ghosts and demons, or endure chronic illness—merely wear this Eight-Character Spirit Text, and malevolent afflictions shall vanish. Livelihoods shall flourish, calamities and demonic influences cease, and the Six Harms be dispelled.\n\nThe Northern Emperor said: If the people of the Lower Realm suffer discord among kin, frequent quarrels, marital strife, or unrest among sons and daughters, they should devoutly and earnestly write the Eight Characters on plain silk on a day of harmonious conjunction, wear and venerate them. With utmost sincerity, divine youths shall attend them day and night, preventing strife. Sons and daughters shall grow in peace, or dreams may reveal matters, ensuring ten thousand harmonious unions.",

You who seek learning must refine your bones and cultivate the true, not merely to guide yourselves but to deliver others, rescuing them from peril and relieving their distress. You must purify yourselves through fasting and abstinence, meditate upon the wondrous mysteries of the True Lords of the Northern Dipper, and rescue both heaven and humanity. Thus shall future generations universally attain peace, and the calamities and dangers of this world gradually dissipate. Such blessings are beyond all reckoning.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"When the people of the Lower Realm perform these rites, they must always do so during the hours of *hai* and *zi*, offering libations to the Seven True Lords of the Stars. They shall execute the *Yu* step, grasp the sword, and face north, burning incense with a sincere and pure heart, never treating the rites with disdain. If the libation is performed with merit, after a thousand days, the spirits shall appear in person—sometimes as a woman of surpassing beauty, sometimes as a beggar. When they appear, you must not speak to them but only bow your head in reverence and present the wishes of your heart. After the spirit has descended for some time, it shall suddenly depart; you must then send it off with a devoted farewell. Take the wine and broth from the altar and consume them, whereupon the spirit’s *qi* shall enter your heart, and you shall naturally possess heaven-born wisdom, knowing future events. You may discern the advance and retreat of armies, the rise and fall of households and states, and receive the illumination of sun and moon within your heart, your body born of water and fire. The spirits may appear as an old man or a youth, entering your dreams to reveal fortune or misfortune.\n\nIf one encounters the inauspicious conjunction of malevolent stars—when prayers go unanswered, official rank does not advance, illness and misfortune abound, the heart and spirit are restless, and strange dreams disturb the night—if cursed by evil men or when the household and state are unsettled, simply practice this method, and no harm shall befall you. You shall prolong your years, extend your life, and forever preserve your place in the world.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"If the land is unsettled, the four directions in turmoil, with roving armies, bandits, tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, and the perils of blades and weapons, simply perform the libation rites to the Seven True Lords of the Stars as prescribed in the scripture. Within two or seven days, the evil shall retreat, and the weapons of war shall fall silent.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"True disciples of the Lower Realm who offer libations to the Seven Stars, cultivate the true, seek immortality, prolong life, and aid the imperiled must await an auspicious day. On the third day of the Dragon’s movement, the fifth day of the Horse’s halt, the seventh day of the Pheasant’s flight, or the ninth day of the Dog’s establishment, perform the libation to the Northern Controller. When the True Lords descend, the blessings shall be ten thousandfold, enabling one’s name to enter the Pure Palace and one’s lifespan to be extended.\"\n\nThe Northern Emperor declared: \"At the time of the libation, present white silk and state: 'I, your humble servant [Name] of [State], respectfully address the Supreme Primordial August One, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable Elder, the Prime Minister of the Immortal Capital, the Envoys of the Nine Heavens, the Azure Dragon and White Tiger of the Left and Right, and the Supervisory Envoys, beseeching your grace to witness and affirm my humble offering.

      "translated_text": "When facing battle, visualize them and perform the sacrificial rites, steadfastly recite the scriptures, and employ talismans, seals, and wondrous incantations to break evil. Follow the ritual protocols, prostrate upon the ground in visualization, all clad in black robes and vermilion crowns, wielding blades, halberds, bows, arrows, dagger-axes, and pole-axes. As they take their seats, none shall fail to respond—rise then and perform the rites of reverence.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"When invoking the incantations, address each by their proper title.\"\n\nYour humble servant respectfully invokes the assembled deities within and beyond the altar: the Heavenly Thearchs, the Perfected, the Ten Poles Elders, the Immortals, the Vajras, the Spirit-Kings, the Black Thearch Generals, the Great Might Demon-Kings, the Northern Culmen Fengdu Luoshan’s Six Cavern-Heavens, the Three Primes, the Six Ministries’ Lords, the tribal hosts, and the great deities of the Seven Primes within the Dipper.\n\nFrom the day your humble servant received the Daoist precepts, a covenant was made with the Northern Thearch and the Three Officials—every movement and thought is bound to this pact. Internally, it governs the body; externally, it saves all beings. With the mind fixed upon the true *qi*, blessings descend and disasters dissolve. The ritual prohibitions are strict, and none dare act recklessly. Yet I reflect upon my own duty, extolling the majesty of the Dao’s transformative power, widely benefiting heaven and humanity. For any who make supplications, I dare not refuse. Now, for the sake of the land’s calamities and epidemics, or the chaos of war and the ravages of marauders across the wilds—when the solar cycle’s *yang* nine has run its course and the hundred-six disasters arise—we beseech the Mysterious Bureau, reverently offering libations and viands to dispel calamity, resolve peril, and pacify the state and household.\n\nMay the Northern Metropolis’ Thearch-Kings with their three hundred thousand troops, the Merit-Officials and Spirit-Generals, the Six *Jia* Generals, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Day-Officials and Decade-Officials, the Direct-Command Envoys, descend with the invoked Celestial Immortals and Great Sages, the Three-Five Generals, the Eighty Thousand Mighty Warriors, the Three Divisions’ Generals, the Dipper’s *Xi* and *Ci* Generals, the Dipper’s Punitive and Destructive Generals, the Revolving Mechanism Generals who repel foes, the *Xi* Generals who dissolve disasters, the Execution Generals who scatter misfortune, the Life-Sustaining Generals who resolve peril—enter your humble servant’s body, follow and shield me. For the state and the household, above, dispel celestial disasters; below, scatter earthly misfortunes. Water and fire’s harms, the hundred poisons and pestilences, the thousand spirits and myriad demons, the brandishing of weapons and war—all are beseeched for deliverance.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"In the Northern Culmen’s Hall resides the Most High Jade Thearch, the Purple Tenuity Emperor-Lord, the Immortals’ Envoys, and the Nine Heavens’ Executive Officers. They can descend to the world to eliminate all disasters—water, fire, blades, and weapons. If there are men or women of the land whose punishments and harms reside in the Greedy Wolf star of the Northern Dipper, invoke the Venerable Lord of the Radiant Yang Mansion to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer calamities, demonic harms, or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Great Gate star, invoke the Venerable Spirit of the Yin Essence Star to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer punishments, disasters, or destructive forces in the Northern Dipper’s Wealth Star, invoke the Perfected Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Literary Star, invoke the Lord of the Mysterious Darkness to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land or within the astrological regions suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Integrity Star, invoke the Cinnabar Prime Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land or within the astrological regions suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Martial Star, invoke the Northern Culmen Lord to resolve and deliver them. If men or women of the land suffer punishments or misfortunes in the Northern Dipper’s Ruined Army star, invoke the Heavenly Pass Lord to resolve and deliver them. May water, fire, blades, weapons, venomous creatures, and fierce beasts all dissolve of themselves. May the state and household attain peace, the living and the dead rejoice in prosperity. With the supreme elixir and numinous cinnabar, forever dispel disasters and epidemics, and attain longevity and enduring vision. The power of the Northern Asterism is beyond comprehension.\"\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"For those born in the Lower Prime, let this Dao be their constant practice in movement and stillness. I shall send the Perfected of the Dipper, the Three Terraces’ Assistants, the attendants of the True Assembly of Sages, to descend among humanity, to save and protect the living, to erase death and restore life, to gather souls and nurture destiny, to sever the *qi* of death, and to deliver them from the Three Disasters. If the land’s regional lords and the ten virtuous ministers encounter demonic calamities in their domains, or within the astrological regions of famous mountains and great marshes, let them practice this Dao daily. Heavenly dragons shall descend, warrior-spirits shall march, the *yin* and *yang* officials shall both come to the rescue. With sincere devotion and resolve, the Jade Maidens shall manifest, enabling the self-dissolution of war, and the world’s tranquility.\"\n\nAt that time, the Northern Thearch, having spoken these words, addressed the assembled multitude, urging them to diligently practice and recite, that they might gain blessings in this life. Transgressions shall disperse, good karma shall form, merits shall be fulfilled, and the Dao shall be attained. Ascend into the formless and natural, join the company of the True Ultimate, and clasp hands with the Highest Immortals. In the methods of salvation and deliverance, rescue comes first.\n\nIn verse, it is proclaimed:\nWith devotion, rely upon the incense’s pledge,\nIts rising smoke shrouds the purple court.\nWith single-minded resolve, follow the cinnabar will,\nThe Mysterious Heaven descends in emerald chariots.\nTransgressions vanish across ten thousand kalpas,\nBlessings extend for a thousand ages.\nIn the Southern Palace, life’s allotment is recorded,\nIn the Northern Bureau, death’s names are erased.\nSouls and spirits rest in their palaces and organs,\nThe *qi* of the passes attains purity and peace.\nWith divine power, mount the Great Mystery,\nWith wondrous traces, ascend to the Highest Clarity.\nNine generations ascend to the celestial gates,\nAnd humanity preserves its longevity.\n\nThe Northern Thearch said: \"This is called *The Scripture of the Divine Soldiers Protecting the State*. If the land suffers calamities, simply hold to its recitation—bandits and weapons shall vanish, and the Three Luminaries shall shine brightly. If a household suffers from demonic epidemics or pestilences, practice exorcism and retreat, and merely recite and perform the sacrificial rites—no spirit-official shall fail to respond. When reciting the scripture, the divine soldiers descend. If, within the ritual arena, there is fear, or the banners and lamps’ shadows stir as if in wind, know that the divine soldiers have descended from the north, and all evil shall scatter in flight.\"\n\nAt that time, all the mighty warriors in the assembly, the Perfected, the Jade Maidens, and the true numina of the nine lands, having heard *The True Scripture for Protecting the State*, universally leapt for joy and vowed with utmost resolve: \"In future ages, should anyone speak our names or depict our forms, we shall hasten to that person’s sincere devotion, deliver them from disasters and illnesses, bring peace to their state and household, fulfill their merits, and enable all beings to together realize the Dao of Non-Action.\"",

At its center, set a high table for the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen and Purple Tenuity, facing south to the east. To the east, arrange tables for the Heavenly Vanguard and the Sagely Wing-Protector; to the west, tables for the Heavenly Strategist and the Sagely Guardian. The five tables correspond to the five directions, each adorned with small banners of the five colors, along with wine and fruit.\n\nWithin the purification hall, arrange the lamp altar, placing tablets of the Four Heavenly Kings at its four corners to guard the altar. Offerings of blessed rice, scissors, a ruler, mirror, scale, lamp bowls, tea, wine, and fruit are made to the northwest. Atop the altar, set a high table for recitation.\n\nAt dawn, invite the Dharma Master to first present the written petition, then proceed as desired with scripture recitation and repentance rites. In the afternoon, follow the ritual protocol to establish the altar, ascend the seat, and expound the scripture. By evening, conclude with the offering of the completed rite.\n\nFor devout and faithful practitioners, it is also fitting to meticulously arrange the five tables within their own homes, reciting with utmost sincerity.
