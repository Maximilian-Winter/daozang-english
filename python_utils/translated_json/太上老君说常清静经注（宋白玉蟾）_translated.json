The preface includes several prefaces and illustrations (originally misattributed as *Annotations on the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*). The main text consists of one fascicle.\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Jade Instructions* category under the *Divine Empyrean* section.\n\n---\n\n### *Annotations on the Scripture of Purity and Tranquility* [Preface]\n\n**The Profound Origins of the Great Dao in the Sacred Records of Laozi**\n\nThe *Scripture of the Divine Empyrean* states: The wondrously ineffable Heavenly Thearch gives birth to the Three Qi and Three Treasures, the Heavenly Lords—\nthe Heavenly Treasure Lord of Mysterious Qi,\nthe Numinous Treasure Lord of Primordial Qi,\nand the Divine Treasure Lord of Original Qi—\nwho are the Three Pure Ones.\nThe Jade Thearch is their ancestor, abiding in the primordial void of the Great Empyrean.\n\nIt further states: The Primordial Beginning descends to transform into the Great Prime of the Jade Palace, dwelling in the Purple Jade Celestial Palace, known as the Great Thearch of the Northern Culmen.\nThe Northern Culmen is the fifth transformation of the Primordial Beginning.\nAt the dawn of the *Red Clarity’s Unfolding Chart*, he became the Divine Duke of Supreme Purity;\nafter the *Inaugural Sovereignty*, he became the Great Thearch of the Northern Darkness.\nHaving accomplished his work of pacification, he resides in the Purple Tenuity Court of the Central Heaven, steadfast and unmoving, called the Celestial Culmen.\nAt times, he transforms into a star, becoming the Heavenly August Thearch;\nin the teachings, he is called the Supreme Lord Lao;\nin heaven, he is the sovereign of all heavens;\ndescending to the world, he is the teacher of a hundred kings.\n\nThe *Chart of Primordial Chaos* states: During the era of the first Three Sovereigns, his transformation was called the Heavenly Master of Myriad Methods.\nSome say the Heavenly Master of Penetrating Mystery, or the Great Master of the Mysterious Center.\nDuring the middle Three Sovereigns, his transformation was called Master Pangu, also known as the Great Master of Ancient Existence.\nDuring the reign of the Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi, his transformation was called Master Yuhua.\nSome say during the era of Nüwa, his transformation was called Master Yumi.\nDuring the era of the Earthly Sovereign Shennong, his transformation was called Master Dacheng.\nDuring the era of the Human Sovereign, the Yellow Emperor, his transformation was called Master Guangcheng.\nDuring the era of Shaohao, his transformation was called Master Suiying.\nDuring the era of Zhuanxu, his transformation was called Master Chijing.\nDuring the era of Emperor Ku, his transformation was called Master Lutu.\nDuring the era of Emperor Yao, his transformation was called Master Wucheng.\nDuring the era of Emperor Shun, his transformation was called Master Yinshou.\nDuring the era of Yu of Xia, his transformation was called Master Zhenxing.\nDuring the era of Tang of Shang, his transformation was called Master Xize.\n\nThough the Supreme Lord Lao transformed across successive ages, he had no record of mortal birth.\nUntil the reign of the eighteenth king of Shang, Yang Jia, he divided his spirit and transformed his qi, entrusting his embryo to the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden.\nAfter eighty-one years, in the gengchen year of the twenty-second king, Wuding, on the fifteenth day of the first month at the hour of mao, he was born in Quren Village, Lai District, Ku County of Chu.\nHis surname was Li, given name Er, style Boyang, and posthumous name Dan.\n\nDuring the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he served as the Archivist of the Royal Archives, later becoming the Historian Beneath the Pillars.\nIn the twenty-third year of the fifth king, King Zhao, he passed through the Hangu Pass, where he instructed the Pass Prefect Yin Xi.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year [of King Zhao], he descended to the Green Ram Market in Shu, where he met Yin Xi, and together they crossed the Flowing Sands. By the reign of King Mu, he returned to the Central Lands. In the twenty-first year of King Ling, the gengxu year, Confucius was born. In the seventeenth year of the twenty-seventh king, King Jing, the wuxu year, Confucius inquired of the rites from Lord Lao, and upon retiring, sighed of him as \"like a dragon.\" In the forty-first year of King Jing, the renshu year, Confucius passed away. In the second year of the thirty-fifth king, King Lie, the dingwei year, he passed through Qin, where Duke Xian of Qin inquired of him regarding the reckoning of time, after which he departed through the Sanyuan Pass. In the eighth year of King Xian, the gengshen year, he moved east. In the ninth year of the thirty-eighth king, King Nan, the yimao year, he again departed through the Sanyuan Pass and ascended to Kunlun in flight.\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty, he descended to the banks of the Shan River, where he was known as the Venerable Man by the River, or the River Master, and transmitted the Dao to Anqi Sheng. Emperor Wen of the Former Han favored the teachings of Laozi and dispatched envoys to summon and inquire of him. The River Master said: \"The Dao is revered, and virtue is noble—these cannot be questioned from afar.\" The emperor then personally journeyed to him.\n\nThe Emperor said: \"Under all heaven, none is not the king’s land; within the bounds of the earth, none is not the king’s subject. Within the realm there are Four Great Ones, and the king is one among them. Though you possess the Dao, you remain my subject. If you cannot submit, how can you be exalted? With but a word from me, I can make the poor rich and the lowly noble.\"\n\nIn an instant, the Venerable Man clapped his hands and leapt into a seated posture, rising gently into the void like a cloud ascending, hovering over a hundred *zhang* above the earth before coming to rest in the boundless emptiness. After a long while, he bowed slightly and replied: \"Now I ascend not to heaven, am not burdened by men, and do not dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? How then can Your Majesty make me rich or poor, noble or base?\"\n\nThe Emperor then understood and recognized him as a divine being. He alighted from his carriage and prostrated himself in reverence, offering his apologies. The Venerable Man bestowed upon him the essential teachings of the *Dao* and *Virtue* in two scriptures.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Cheng, he descended to the springs of Quyang and transmitted the *Scripture of Supreme Peace* to Yu Ji. In the time of Emperor Zhang of the Han, he imparted to Yu Ji the *One Hundred and Eighty Great Precepts*. Under Emperor An, he revealed to Liu Tu the *New Code of Sin and Fortune*. During the reign of Emperor Shun, he descended to confer upon the Celestial Master the *Catalogue of the Three Caverns*. In the era of Emperor Huan, he descended upon Mount Tiantai and bestowed upon Ge Xiaoxian the various scriptures of *Highest Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Great Cavern*. In the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, he descended upon Mount Song and transmitted to the Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi the *New Code of Talismans and Registers*. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu of the Great Tang, he descended upon Yangjiao Mountain and spoke to Ji Shanxing, instructing him to receive the Mandate Talisman. In the first year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Ming, he descended at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, and the Emperor personally received him at the Xingqing Palace. He also descended to speak with Tian Tongxiu, revealing the *Golden Casket of Numinous Talismans* hidden at the Hangu Pass. Further, he descended to instruct Wang Yuanyi in the *Wondrous Treasure of True Talismans*.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenghe era of the Song, he descended upon the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and transmitted to Master Liang the *Extended Sentences of the Heavenly Child Scripture for Protecting Life*. It is also said: \"The Venerable Lord appears in every age, transforming and teaching before the kalpas of dust, enduring beyond the infinite, now hidden, now manifest—his transformations are boundless. He acts without contrivance, abiding in spontaneity, eternally enduring. He silently upholds the imperial order, profound beyond profundity. His universal deliverance of heaven and humanity cannot be fully recounted.\"\n\nMaster Chongzhen said: \"Regarding the principles of nurturing life and cultivating nature, the essential method lies in preserving the Three and embracing the One. The Three are essence, *qi*, and spirit—these are called the Three Treasures.\"\n\nThe Old Man of Xiangchuan said: \"Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit. These govern the flourishing and defense of the body—nothing is greater than this, for they are the true foundation of cultivation.\"\n\n*The Diagram of the Three Treasures of the Primordial Origin*\nTan Jingsheng said: \"To preserve the Three and embrace the One is to refine essence into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, and refine spirit to merge with the Dao, penetrating the wondrous spontaneity of nature.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"Heaven has Three Treasures: the sun, moon, and stars. Humans have Three Treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit. The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes as sight; the essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears as hearing; the ethereal soul of the spleen manifests in the nose as smell; the corporeal soul of the gallbladder manifests in the mouth as speech. When one spirit moves, all spirits move; when one aperture opens, all nine apertures open. If one gate is securely locked, all gates are firm—turning the body, the true path becomes effortless.\"\n\n*The Diagram of Inner Observation for the Initial Realization of Stillness and Stability*\n*The Diagram of the Great Way of the Golden Elixir*\nBai Yuchan said: \"The heart without a heart has no form; within the formless, nurture the numinous infant. When the study of immortality reaches the state of the infant, the moon shines bright in the cold pool’s stillness.\"\n\n*Transmission of Scriptures and Verification of the Dao*\nThe Immortal Ge Xuan said: \"I obtained this Dao after reciting the scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heaven and humanity; it is not transmitted to the unworthy. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Tower, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it. Those of superior attainment who awaken to it ascend as officials of heaven; those of middling attainment become immortals of the Southern Palace; those of lesser attainment who obtain it enjoy long life in the world, roaming the Three Realms and ascending through the Golden Gate.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Left Mystery said: \"Those who study the Dao and recite this scripture will be protected by the ten celestial benevolent spirits. Then, with the jade talisman guarding the spirit and the golden liquid refining the form, both form and spirit become wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Orthodox Unity said: \"Households possessing this scripture, if they awaken to its meaning, will be free from calamities and obstructions. All sages will guard their gates, their spirits will ascend to the upper realms, and they will pay homage to the Most Honored. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they will be received by the Lord Emperor. Those who recite and uphold it without ceasing will ascend amidst purple clouds.\"\n\n*Transmission of Scriptures*\nSu Shangqing said: \"A youth transmits the scriptures and inquires of the perfected; with a heartless response to the world, he abides in eternal peace. When the time comes to serve the scriptures, there will be a day of wind and clouds—then he shall ride the simurgh and tread the jade steps of the celestial court.\"\n\n*Opening the Scriptures*\nQiu Changchun said: \"Those who leave the household have a dharma saying: 'Be loyal to the sovereign above, filial to parents below.' Those who neither bow to the sovereign above nor to parents below are neither loyal nor filial. Such self-aggrandizing and self-exalting words do not accord with the great Dao and make entry into the immortal lineage difficult—they have forgotten their roots.\"\n\nMaster Yin said: \"Among the ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, loyalty and filial piety come first. In heaven and on earth, expediency is foremost.\"\n\n*Awakening*\nBai Yuchan said: \"Mulberry fields become seas, seas become fields—in a single instant, a hundred years pass. If you turn the pivot at the crown of the head, who among you is not a Perfected of the Great Mystery?\"\n\n*Enlightened Master*\nWu Zhenzi said: \"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting an enlightened master, do not force guesses. For the golden elixir has no oral transmission—where then can you bind the numinous embryo?\"\n\n*Oral Transmission*\nLiao Zhenzi said: \"The great medicine consists of three: essence, *qi*, and spirit—naturally, mother and child are mutually intimate. Returning the wind to merge with the true body, the work of refinement renews day by day.\"\n\n*Practice of Merit*\nLiao Zhenzi said: \"Within the merit of no-merit, strive diligently in merit; beyond merit, no merit accords with sagely merit.\"\n\nRefining the Elixir Field into supreme treasure, let the crow and hare race east and west as they will.\n\n*Attaining the Dao*\nBi Yuanshu said: A single grain of golden elixir—how resplendently red! Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine. Each person’s share is originally perfect and complete; nightly, the numinous radiance ever fills the chamber.\n\n*Transcending the Mundane*\nChen Niuwan said: After a year’s gestation, one child is born—offspring begetting offspring in endless branches. In the myriad billions of transformations lies the subtlest marvel—how could this be lightly taught to others?\n\n*Entering Sagehood*\nLü Dongbin said: Alone I ascend the high mountain to gaze upon the eight directions; black clouds disperse, leaving the moon solitary. In the boundless cosmos, countless are the people—how many among them are true men?\n\n*Laozi’s Scripture on Constant Clarity and Stillness, with Commentary*\nHainan Qiong Guanzi Bai Yuchan divided the text into chapters and corrected errors; Wang Yuanhui of Zhongnan, the Hidden and Subtle Master, provided annotations.\n\n*Tai* means “non-being”; *shang* means “ultimate”; *shuo* means “to unfold and transform.” *Chang qing jing* (“constant clarity and stillness”) refers to the vast and formless Dao, naturally arising and completing the Three Powers and the myriad things—unchanged from ancient times to the present.\n\n*Jing* means “the heart,” the mystery within mystery, the gate of all wonders. Master Shao said: “Heaven’s creative transformations emerge from unity; human affairs arise from the heart’s governance. How could heaven and humanity possess two different principles? The Dao does not operate in vain—it resides solely in the person.”\n\n*Chapter One: The Primordial Dao*\nLaozi said: (Commentary by Laozi appears earlier in *Origins and Sources*. The present edition omits the two characters *Tai Shang*.)\n\nThe *Daode Jing* states: “The Dao as it emerges from the mouth is bland, seemingly without flavor. Looked for, it cannot be seen; listened for, it cannot be heard; used, it cannot be exhausted.”\n\nThe Fuxi Superior Man said: “Once you grasp the delight within the zither, why labor over the sound upon the strings?”\n\nThe Great Dao is formless, the beginning of non-being. It gives birth to heaven and earth, requiring no arrangement—naturally so.\n\nThe *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Vast and formless, spirit and *qi* constitute the real. Spirit is not vague; *qi* is not misty. Spirit generates the myriad spirits; *qi* generates the myriad *qi*. The myriad spirits return to one; the myriad *qi* merge into one. Spirit is the mechanism of the Dao; *qi* is its pivot. As the mechanism shifts and the pivot transforms, the Three Realms come into being. The Primordial Ancestral Spirit generates the myriad perfected; the Primordial Ancestral *Qi* transforms the various heavens.”\n\nThe Great Dao is without sentiment, the beginning of being. It sets the sun and moon in motion. The numinous treasure of pure clarity illumines without end.\n\nThe *Jin Astronomic Treatise* states: “Heaven is round like an inverted canopy; earth is square like a chessboard. Half the celestial sphere lies above the earth, half below. The sun and moon originally move eastward, while heaven rotates westward.”\n\nThe *Han Armillary Sphere* states: “The celestial sphere measures 365¼ degrees. Its body is round like a pellet, higher in the north and lower in the south, resembling an inverted canopy. The north celestial pole rises 36 degrees above the earth; the south celestial pole sinks 36 degrees below. The straight-line distance between the south and north poles is slightly less than 182 degrees. Following the curvature of the celestial sphere, the distance between the poles is slightly more than 182 degrees, precisely at the center of heaven. Midway between the north and south poles lies the equator, 91 degrees from each pole. At the spring equinox, the sun travels along the equator. At the summer solstice, it moves 24 degrees north of the equator, 67 degrees from the north pole and 115 degrees from the south pole—this is called the ‘black path.’ After the summer solstice, the sun gradually moves southward; at the autumn equinox, it returns to the equator, as at the spring equinox. At the winter solstice, it travels 24 degrees south of the equator, 67 degrees from the south pole and 115 degrees from the north pole—this is called the ‘yellow path.’ After the winter solstice, the sun gradually moves northward again. Moreover, the moon’s path closely parallels the sun’s, crossing it at two points. Half lies within the sun’s path, half outside. Where they intersect, the two paths coincide; at their farthest separation, they diverge by six degrees. Such is the general outline of the sun and moon’s movements.”\n\nThe *Han Records* state: “The sun moves one degree per day; the moon moves 13⁷⁄₁₉ degrees per day. The sun moves slowly, the moon swiftly. The sun is fundamentally yang; the moon is fundamentally yin. The moon cannot illuminate itself but relies on the sun for brightness. When it conjoins with the sun, it becomes dark (new moon); when it opposes the sun, it becomes full. Its waxing follows a sequence: after three days, a crescent appears—hence it is called *fěi*. After eight days, the moon has traversed 84¼ degrees, and its brightness reaches half—hence it is called the ‘first quarter.’ After fifteen days, it is called the ‘full moon,’ for it faces the sun and shines fully. After sixteen days, the lunar essence (*pò*) begins to grow, as the yin essence waxes and brightness wanes. After twenty-three days, the lunar essence reaches half—hence it is called the ‘last quarter.’ After 27½ days, the moon has traversed 365 degrees, completing its celestial circuit, while the sun has moved 27 degrees ahead. Thus, the moon must travel another 2½ days to rejoin the sun at the next new moon.”\n\nIt further states: “Earth resides at the center while heaven revolves around it. When the sun is above the earth, it is day; when below, night. Such is the path of the sun and moon’s movement.”\n\nThe *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Once chaos divided, the Brahma-*qi* expanded. The great became the sun and moon; the fine became the stars.”\n\nMaster Yunfang said: “The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang, giving birth to and completing the myriad things. Rising in the east and setting in the west, they divide day and night; moving south and north, they determine cold and heat.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “Kunlun is vast beyond all bounds, its depths and expanse immeasurable. Yin and yang never cease their movement; cold and heat alternate in their coming and going.”\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless, the origin of the myriad images. It nurtures the myriad things. The two *qi* intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony.\n\nLaozi said: “The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: “The Way of earth is to contain and radiate vastness. The myriad things rely on it for birth. It is stirred by thunder and nourished by wind and rain.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The Supreme Harmony spreads through all beings; the Benefit and Perseverance secure the numinous root. Without sincerity, nothing exists; the five natures truly abide herein. I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao.”\n\nThe Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate said: “The Limitless merges with the Great Dao in transformation, establishes the root of heaven and earth, distributes *qi* throughout the ten directions, and embraces the utmost purity of virtue and power. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named.” Thus, Laozi called it the Dao; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* called it the Origin; the *Book of Changes* called it the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “From *qi* transformation arises the name of the Dao.” He also said: “From *qi* transformation arise the names of the Way of heaven, the Way of earth, and the Way of man.”\n\nChen Zi’ang said: “Confucius expounded the Supreme Ultimate; Laozi prized the profound and obscure. The Golden Immortals of the West revere righteousness, yet it is ignorance.”\n\n**Chapter Two: The Naturalness of Creation**\n\nAs for the Dao, before *qi* was manifest, there was clarity—the beginning of yang *qi*; there was turbidity—the beginning of yin *qi*. There was movement and stillness. Yang moves and yin is still, giving rise to the Three Powers. Heaven is clear and earth is turbid: clear *qi* becomes heaven, turbid *qi* becomes earth. Heaven moves and earth is still. Heaven is round and moves, enveloping the earth without. Earth is square and still, situated within heaven. Man is clear and woman is turbid; man moves and woman is still.\n\n☰ The male and ☷ the female unite and give birth. Descending from root to branch, they generate the myriad things.\n\n☰☷☳ The Three Powers give birth to the myriad things.\n\n*Guanzi* said: “That which is empty and formless is called the Dao.”\n\nThe *Han Treatise on Harmonics and Calendrics* states: “The primordial *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate contains the Three as One”—that is, heaven, earth, and man.\n\n*Liezi* said: “The light and clear *qi* of the primordial *qi* becomes heaven; the heavy and turbid becomes earth; the harmonious and balanced *qi* becomes man.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “When the *qi* of heaven and earth combine, they encounter the transformations of cold and heat, dryness and dampness, wind and fire in their alternating dominance. Thus, human *qi* follows them, and the myriad things are transformed and born. All arises from the union and dispersion of the three *qi*, generating endless transformations.”\n\nMaster *Wu Zhen* said: “The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One *qi*; from the One *qi* emerge yin and yang. Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies; the Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of the myriad things. Clarity is the source of solitude; movement is the foundation of stillness.”\n\nShaozi said: “From the Limitless arises the Supreme Ultimate, in the undifferentiated vastness. Yang moves and yin is still—all within the Supreme Ultimate. Yang moves and yin is still, endlessly circulating. The original substance of the Supreme Ultimate resides within yin and yang.”\n\nThe Buddha said: “Water flows, yet its source is the sea; the moon sets, yet it does not leave the sky.” (Another version reads: “Stillness is the foundation of movement.”)\n\n“If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return.”\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: “Man is born with the form of heaven.”\n\nLi Shaowei said: “I am heaven and earth; heaven and earth are I.”\n\nMaster Liu said: “The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it. If one can empty the heart, the Dao will naturally return.”\n\nMaster Yuxi said: “Why is this heart connected to great creation? Only because it originally comes from the Dao.”\n\n**Chapter Three: Uniting Spirit with the Dao**\n\nThe human spirit favors clarity, yet the heart disturbs it. The Dao is originally without demons; it is the human heart that creates obstacles.\n\nMaster Yuxi said: “From the Dao divides my original spirit; my original spirit is the Great Dao itself.”\n\nMaster Wang the Shoemaker said: “When the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous; when the heart is scattered, the spirit is wild.”\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: “May I inquire about the supreme Dao?”\n\nLao Dan replied: “Dredge and cleanse the heart; bathe and purify the spirit.”\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: “If sounds and colors do not cease, the spirit will not be clear. If thoughts and worries do not cease, the heart will not be at peace. When the heart is not at peace, the spirit is not numinous; when the spirit is not numinous, the Dao is not achieved.”\n\nThe human heart favors stillness, yet desires pull it away. “The Dao rises one foot; demons rise ten.” The True Lord of Heavenly Plans said: “Though the sun and moon are bright, floating clouds cover them; though rivers are clear, sand and stones muddy them; though the human heart is still, desires pull it away.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord of Zitong said: “White clouds are originally without intent; the wind sends them drifting from the peaks.”\n\nIf one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally be still. With intent unobstructed and heart at ease, *qi* is robust and the spirit at peace.\n\nThe *Scripture of Perfect Realization* states: “Few desires, heart still; forget emotions, burdens light.”\n\nLaozi said: “Its dwelling is deep and still—is this not the human heart?”\n\nThe *Scripture of Water and Fire* states: “Desire arises from the heart; stillness comes from settling the heart. Heart and breath depend on each other; when breath is regulated, the heart is still.”\n\nWhen the heart is settled, the spirit naturally becomes clear. The cosmos radiates light, and demon kings bow their heads.\n\nMaster Yanluo said: “Settle the heart.” When the heart is settled and the spirit still, chaotic thoughts do not arise, perverse delusions do not invade, and worries and anxieties all vanish. “An empty room generates brightness”—this depends solely on settling the heart.\n\nLü Dongbin said: “One day of leisure is one day as an immortal; when the six spirits harmonize, one is naturally at peace. The cinnabar field holds treasure—why seek the Dao? Face circumstances without intent—why ask about Chan?”\n\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished. The yin *po* dissipates, and the yang spirit manifests.\n\nBai Yuchan said: “Have you not seen that emptiness generates the natural? The natural generates the One *qi*. The One *qi* congeals into things; when *qi* is sufficient, heaven and earth divide. Heaven and earth are originally without intent; the two *qi* are naturally so. The myriad things have flourishing and decay; great destinies have endings and beginnings. If you comprehend the original naturalness of the prior heaven, you grasp the true root of nature and life.”\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* of five thousand words, the *Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman*. Form and spirit, nature and life, body and heart, spirit and *qi*. Their interaction and fusion form the great treasure—this is the principle of the golden elixir. The worldly often cling to things, provisionally taking “having action” as the return to “non-action.”\n\nA resolute man of mettle may grasp the essence—\ntry these words, slowly savoring them in quiet.\nIf you trace the hearts of ancient sages and worthies,\ntheir laws for transforming others were never amiss.\nHow much more, then, to stride straight down the direct path,\na single road ascending to the Three Clarities’ halls.\n\nMaster Xu Jing of Empty Tranquility said:\n“The superior man who attains it and preserves it—\nascension is simply this work.”\nYet those who cannot do so\nare disordered in *qi* by wealth, confused in nature by wine and sensuality.\n\nXi Kang said:\n“There are five difficulties in nurturing life:\nfailing to extinguish fame and profit,\nfailing to remove joy and anger,\nfailing to cast off sound and beauty,\nfailing to sever rich flavors,\nand the dissipation of spirit and thought.”\n\nLiu Haichan said:\n“Cultivating immortality is most easy—\nit is man who makes it hard.\nShedding the dust is not difficult—\nit is man who finds it not easy.”\n\nThe Perfected of Pure Emptiness said:\n“A three-year-old child can speak of it,\nyet an eighty-year-old cannot practice it.”\nFor the heart is not yet settled—\nliving, fluid, turning, limpid.\n\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* says:\n“The human Dao lies in the heart—\ntruly, it does not depend on others.”\n\nWang Zhiyuan said:\n“Like striking a ball upon swift waters.”\n\nHan Xiang said:\n“Waves churn the sea of nature,\nclouds veil the heaven of the heart.”\n\nLong ago, Master Ma Danyang secluded himself on Mount Zhongnan.\nOne day, Liu Chuxuan arrived and bowed outside the hermitage wall.\nDanyang, knowing Liu’s heart was not yet extinguished,\ncalled to him through the wall:\n“Go to the Liu Immortal Maiden in Henan Prefecture.\nReturn after three years.”\nLiu immediately set out.\nThe Immortal Maiden, foreseeing his arrival,\nadorned herself and awaited him.\nAt first sight, Liu’s heart stirred.\nThe Immortal Maiden said to him:\n“I merely tested you.\nRemove this heart, and your task is complete.”\nLiu, filled with remorse,\nsat in meditation in the tiled alleyways of Luoyang’s flower district,\ndaily transforming food to sustain himself.\nAfter three years, his heart extinguished,\nhe sensed attainment and returned to see Danyang.\nDanyang, seeing him, said:\n“It is done.”\nAnd transmitted the Dao.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow, the Perfected Immortal Liu of the Quanzhen School is such a one.\n\nHuayangzi said:\n*One day the heavens are windless,\nThe four seas’ waves all stilled.\nYet the human heart’s wind does not cease—\nIts waves rise a hundred feet high.*\nDesire has not yet been dispelled.\n\nThe ear follows sound astray; the eye is deceived by form.\nThe Lady of Upper Prime said to Emperor Wu:\n“Do you love the Dao?\nYou have summoned many masters, climbed mountains to sacrifice to spirits—this is indeed diligent.\nYet your inborn nature is violent, your inborn nature is lewd, your inborn nature is extravagant, your inborn nature is cruel, your inborn nature is treacherous—these five ever dwell within your *rongwei* and five viscera.\nIf from now on you cast aside these five natures, return to softness and goodness, constantly practice yin virtue, save and deliver those in mortal peril, and refrain from spilling essence, there may yet be hope for you.”\n\nMaster Cao said:\n*A maiden of sixteen, her body like soft lard,\nAt her waist hangs a sword to slay fools.\nThough no heads seem to fall,\nIn secret she drains the wise of marrow and bone.*\nOne who can dispel this lets all things dissolve in a single laugh.\n\nWei Yuanjun said:\n*Enough, enough, enough!\nWorld-conquering fame and merit bring no freedom.*\n\nHuang Shigong said:\n*Cut off cravings, restrain desires—this removes encumbrances.\nReject wine, renounce sensuality—this keeps one unstained.*\n\nWenzi said:\n*Cast aside what lures and entices; remove what you crave and desire.*\n\nHuang Shigong also said:\n*Court ministers wait for dawn in the fifth watch’s cold,\nGenerals in iron armor cross passes at night.\nThe recluse sleeps late, still abed at daybreak—\nCount it up: fame and profit are not so fine as idleness.*\n\nTurn the gaze inward upon the heart; reflect the light back—this is to rectify the heart.\nWhen the heart is without its heart—\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*The Dao is the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe heart is the Supreme Ultimate.*\n\nHe also said:\n*When the heart is without opposition or compliance, it is no-heart.*\n\nThe Three Lords of Mao said:\n*The spirit terrace, limpid as an ice-filled flask,\nOnly permits the original spirit to dwell within.\nIf you leave even one thing inside,\nHow can you realize the Dao and merge with pure emptiness?*\n\nTurn the gaze outward upon form; observe it through the Dao—neither noble nor base.\nThis is to rectify form.\nWhen form is without its form—\n\nMaster Zhu said:\n*The Dao as substance is so vast it has no outside, so minute it has no inside.*\n\nThe Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate said:\n*Its body is naturally so,\nBorn before the Great Void, arising without cause.\nIt traverses heaven and earth from beginning to end—\nNo name or measure can contain it.*\n\nThe Perfected Immortal of the Great Mystery said:\n*A speck of round brightness equals the Great Void,\nOnly because thought arises does the body form.\nIf you can let go and turn the light back,\nIt remains as before: pure emptiness, the original one thing.*\n\nBefore father and mother were born, all was spirit—\nIt is not spiritless, only because the body has formed.\nOnce formed, it veils the seed of radiance—\nLet go, and it is once more utterly clear.\n\nObserve afar the myriad things: if you regard them through things, you esteem yourself and belittle them.\nThis is to rectify things.\nWhen things are without their things—\n\nBai Yuchan’s commentary on the *Laozi* said:\n*The Dao as thing—\nAh, vague! Ah, indistinct!\nIndistinct, ah vague! Within it are images.\nVague, ah indistinct! Within it are things.\nDark, ah profound! Within it is essence.\nIts essence is most true; within it is sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to now—*\n\nLü Dongbin said:\n*Within this lies the wondrous truth—\nWho says one cannot attain long life?*\n\nThe *Divine Empyrean Scripture* said:\n*Above, there is no further spirit; below, there is no further qi.*\n\nWuchengzi said:\n*There is a thing prior to heaven and earth,\nFormless, originally quiescent and desolate.\nIt can be lord of the ten thousand images,\nUnchanging through the four seasons’ decay.*\n\nOnce these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.\nEnclose the three in one—precious is spontaneity.\n\nThe *Scripture of Heavenly Protection and Longevity* said:\n*Observe afar the responsive and transformed—no responsive transformation: no things.\nObserve within the original spirit—no original spirit: no heart.\nObserve without the dharma-realm—no dharma-realm: no form.\nNaturally, respond with stillness and be still—within stillness is spirit.\nFrom nonbeing arises being; essence can generate qi.\nRespond with quiescence and be quiescent—quiescent and thus true.\nWithin emptiness, not empty—qi can generate spirit.*\n\nXiaoyaozi said:\n*Not knowing this principle,\nOnly because it is too distinct.*\n\nObserve emptiness through emptiness—emptiness has nothing to empty.\nThe Dao has no image.\n\nXu Jingsun’s *Stone Casket Record* said:\n*Play with true emptiness, reveal immortal traces—\nDo not say we shall meet again in a future life.\nToo foolish and ignorant, cease discussing the wondrous!\nTo speak of true emptiness is to speak of true emptiness.\nAffairs are not different from emptiness—this is form.\nForm is not empty—its colors bloom and glow red.\nI reveal to you the secret of my lineage:\nThe sun moves into the bright moon.\nThe bright moon, the sun—these are heaven’s medicine.\nWhen humans ingest it, they ride phoenixes and cranes.*\n\nShi Xinglin said:\n*Not knowing the wondrousness of the elixir scripture,\nAll day they toy with true emptiness.\nWhat is emptied is already nothing—\nNothingness, too, is nothing.*\n\nThe spirit has no direction.\n\n*The Huainanzi* states: The great man is serene and free from striving, roaming carefree with the transformations of creation.\n\nMaster Liaozhen said:\nThe great Dao was originally nothing at all—\nIf you can guard this One, the spirit dwells within.\nThis heart, clear as the moon at the pond’s center,\nUnbound by even a thread, is naturally thus.\nNothingness, too, is nothing—profoundly still and quiescent.\n\nThe nature has no form.\n*The Sutra of Unobstructed Supreme Vehicle* states: When the mind arises, the nature perishes; when the mind is quiescent, the nature appears. Like empty space without image, profoundly still and quiescent.\n\nQiu Changchun said:\nThe Dao and virtue are originally without image—\nPainting and ink cannot capture their truth.\nSages and worthies silently aid the world,\nFrom ancient times to now, wordlessly communing with the divine.\nStillness has no object of stillness—how could desire arise?\n\nQi has no form.\nLaozi said: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I am without desire, and the people become simple.\n\nMaster Wuzhen said:\nGood and evil forgotten in a single thought,\nHonor and decay no longer touch the heart.\nWhen desire does not arise, this is true stillness.\n\nMists disperse, the sun shines bright;\nDust settles, the mirror gleams clear.\nLady Wei said: The Dao arises from tranquility.\n\nLong ago, Shi Jianwu, who had long yearned for the Dao, practiced without success. Day and night, he reflected, burdened as if by thorns. Upon reading *The Three Clarities Scripture*, he found: Those who cultivate and refine must enter the Three Gates of Stillness, tempering spirit and qi, mending and extending years and life.\n\nGreat Stillness: three hundred days;\nMiddle Stillness: two hundred days;\nLesser Stillness: one hundred days.\nResolving to test himself with Lesser Stillness, he shut his door and did not emerge, fulfilling the hundred-day term before leaving the stillness chamber. Before a month had passed, his spirit shone radiant; at a hundred days, his essence and vitality were clear and robust.\n\nAt three hundred days, his eyes gleamed like lacquer dots, his skin smooth as congealed lard; all long-standing ailments dissolved, and body and mind felt light and refreshed. Thus one knows the wondrous formulas of the immortals’ scriptures are no empty words.\n\nShi Xinglin said:\n*No speck clouds the heart-heaven,\nNo dust stirs on the nature-earth.\nIn the still night where the moon shines bright,\nA spring bird’s call rings clear.*\n\nIn true stillness, one responds to things—\n*Round and full, luminous and bright.*\n(An alternate version reads: *In true constancy, one responds to things.*)\n\nLaozi said: *There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.*\n\nLiu Haichan said: *He who only awakens to true nature and refrains from refining the elixir—know that through ten thousand kalpas, transformation remains arduous.*\n\nMaster Wang the Cobbler said: *When qi stills, spirit gathers; when spirit gathers, the elixir forms.*\n\n*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The Dao of the elixir is not forged from the five metals of the human realm, nor the eight minerals, cinnabar, or mercury. It is the merging of form with emptiness, vast and utterly void—this is called true emptiness. The body of true emptiness is the foundation of the returned elixir, the mother of the great medicine.*\n\n*What form does the mother of the great medicine take? What appearance, what substance? The substance is a thing within the formless, a thing that comes to dwell before the throne of the Emperor. The Emperor’s throne is true emptiness, united with spontaneity. True emptiness and spontaneity merge with form and image; form and image are set in motion by spirit. As true emptiness moves, it is not empty—its wondrous non-emptiness holds numinous power.*\n\nMaster Qiu said:\n*At the first turning of the elixir,\nIn the dark depths of the sea, a red sun rises.\nAuspicious clouds and mist fill the Three Fields,\nAnd a mysterious pearl, like a millet grain, is sown.*\n\n*At the second turning,\nThe flaming Vermilion Bird scorches heaven and earth.\nRosy light enters the crucible, tiger and dragon coil—\nA single grain of yellow sprout, like a dog’s tooth, appears.*\n\n*At the third turning,\nThe three powers blend their images to form the elixir.\nIts appearance, fair or plain, follows one’s intent—\nThe celestial essence that shapes the body has begun.*\n\n*At the fourth turning,\nThe sacred gate of Penglai’s isles remains ever sealed.\nIn stillness, the Wheel of Longevity turns in secret,\nAnd boundless numinous light illumines the true adept.*\n\n*At the fifth turning,\nThe numinous true one daily cultivates the immortal’s abode.\nLayer upon layer, the Dao’s qi augments its radiance,\nEver nourishing the lord of spirit and light.*\n\n*At the sixth turning,\nDay and night, the river chariot races along the sacred axle.\nThe numinous spring ascends to Kunlun’s peak—\nA wheel of moon bathes in the Jasper Pool.*\n\n*At the seventh turning,\nWithin the light of non-doing, the numinous essence is concealed.\nThe true officials uphold the Dao’s qi,\nAnd a thousand spirits descend with blessings to the spirit chamber.*\n\n*At the eighth turning,\nThe fetal immortal is refined, full as the moon.\nWalking together, sitting together, sleeping together,\nThough amid the dust, none recognize him.*\n\n*At the ninth turning,\nThe sacred work is complete, the fetal immortal perfected.\nHaving attained the body of freedom in emptiness,\nNo further firing is needed.*\n\nTrue constancy attains nature.\nThe wondrous one, the numinous presence,\nIs perfectly attuned across the Three Realms.\n\nLi Huayang said: *To neglect true nature and pursue only life-destiny—this is the foremost malady in cultivation.*\n\nNature is like a vessel: what it contains is like a precious pearl, and the light within the pearl is nature. When nature manifests, in the womb it becomes the body, in the world it becomes a person; in the eyes it is seeing, in the ears it is hearing, in the nose it smells fragrance, in the mouth it speaks; the hands move, the feet act—scattered, it fills the six directions; gathered, it resides in the square inch of the heart. The wise recognize it as true nature; the deluded mistake it for the hun-soul.\n\n*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The primal womb of father and mother cannot be discussed—vast and teeming, it births ten thousand kinds of souls. Conceived in the womb, born in moisture, transformed in the fourth month: humans, beasts, birds, insects—countless forms. Each is endowed with nature, and nature is linked to life-destiny, the soul bound to life. Fundamentally, humans and animals alike receive qi from the father and form from the mother. Following the hidden pattern of heaven and earth, when qi is sufficient, they are born, each with its proper nature and destiny. This principle is perfectly clear. Now, when practitioners speak of sitting transformation, if their thoughts err at the final moment, they lose their body and enter another womb. Truly, this is a warning!*\n\nMaster Xu Jing said: *The Dao is not far—it resides within the body. All things are empty, yet nature is not empty. If nature is not empty and unites with qi, qi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.*\n\nEver responsive,\nEver still,\nEver pure and still.\n\nMaster Hao said: *The body of concentration is without thought; the illumination of wisdom is boundless. When concentration and wisdom merge, wondrous function is infinite.*\n\nMaster Cao said: *Merge into one and then forget the one—you may emerge and submerge with the primal transformation. Piercing metal and stone is no difficulty; sitting liberation and standing transcendence are swift as a flash.*\n\nIn such purity and stillness,\nOne gradually enters the true Dao.\n*Mind and nature unstained,\nOne enters the gate of a myriad wonders.*\n\nMaster Han said: *The great Dao of emptiness and nothingness is pure, still, subtle, and recondite. Unstained is called pure; unmoving is called still; unseen is called subtle; unheard is called recondite. Diligently practice these four, and after three years, one escapes the wheel of rebirth.*\n\nHe also said: *When the six roots are pure and the square inch is limpid, with long practice, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain. How can this be taken lightly?*\n\nSa Shoujian said:\n*Autumn moon on a cold pond,\nGreen stream without a trace.*\n\nHaving entered the true Dao, one is called *attained the Dao.*\nThe mind is like empty space, yet empty space is not the mind.\n\nMaster Red Pine said: *Returning to nature, one enters emptiness; concentrating spirit, one enters primordial chaos.*\n\nThe ancients said: *Immortals are but mortals who have done it—this is called attaining the Dao.*\n\nXue Daoguang said: *The guests of Penglai’s three isles are not in the west.*\n\nThough called *attained the Dao,* if one’s manifestation of the Dharma is not true—\n\nLiu Haichan said: *The true mark is without mark, the wondrous Dharma-gate.*\n\nMaster Wu Zhen said: *Light at the nape is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.*\n\nTruly, there is nothing attained.\n*True Dharma does not manifest.*\nSeen, it cannot be seen—*it is without color.*\nHeard, it cannot be heard—*it is without sound.*\nGrasped, it cannot be grasped—*it is without form.*\n\nMaster Yuxi said: *To seek it in another’s heart is futile—it is neither within nor without, neither between.*\n\nBeheld, it cannot be seen; heard, it is without sound—\nvast and luminous, it pervades the ten thousand realms.\n\nThe Immortal Scriptures say: *Within the profound and obscure, the primordial true qi is dimly discerned.*\nZhou Ziyang said: *Like a fish drinking water, the warmth or chill is known only to oneself.*\nTao Hongjing said: *It may only delight the self; it cannot be sent to another.*\n\nTo transform sentient beings is called *attaining the Dao.*\nThe myriad transformations all interpenetrate—*the Dao is fundamentally nameless.*\nThe *Huainanzi* says: *The supreme Dao is non-action; it expands and contracts, rolls and unfurls, changing with the times.*\n\nThus the Most High adapts teachings to circumstances to reveal the Dao.\nYet the ten thousand dharmas and thousand gates ultimately converge in the One—\nthough their names differ, they all emerge from the heart.\n\nThe *Six Secret Teachings* records Taigong’s words: *All people possess nature, yet their inclinations diverge.*\nThose who awaken to it may attain the sagely Dao.\n*Thought is called wisdom; wisdom makes the sage.*\n\nMaster Zhang said: *To truly know the root-source is called knowing the Dao.*\nMaster Zhu said: *From ancient times to the present, it has rolled on thus—nothing but the alternation of yin and yang. What impels this? The Dao.*\nMaster Shao said:\n*When one awakens to the flux of fortune and misfortune, advance and retreat become clear;\nwhen one sees through Qian and Kun, closeness and distance are discerned.\nSince grasping the meaning of the center,\nthe mind’s idle qi has vanished without a trace.*\n\n**Chapter Four: The Perception of the Wise and Foolish**\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said:\n*The superior person does not contend—* *nature’s heaven is vast.*\n*The inferior person loves contention—* *wisdom’s power knows no bounds.*\n\nLaozi said: *The Dao of Heaven does not contend, yet excels in victory.*\nThe Immortal Scriptures say: *Guarding the Dao for a single day can seize the primal qi of Heaven and Earth for a year.*\n\nSa Shoujian said: *A solitary cloud drifts in freedom; a wild crane roams at will.*\n\nThe virtuous of high virtue do not act as if virtuous—*non-action.*\nThe virtuous of low virtue cling to virtue—*action.*\n\nYanzi said: *Cast off the limbs, dull the senses, depart from form, abandon knowledge.*\nWenzi said: *Vast intelligence and broad wisdom are guarded by foolishness; extensive learning and eloquence are guarded by restraint.*\n\nZhang Jiucheng said:\n*In poverty, one despairs; in wealth, one grows arrogant—\nturning the heart, alone one delights in a simple gourd bowl.\nThe joy found here no one understands;\nlong have I lamented the fading of this legacy.*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: *Gazing at stars and worshipping the moon, one wearies the self and labors the body; chasing appearances and seeking sounds, one yearns for immortality to cure illness.*\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* records Bian Que’s words: *When illness reaches the marrow, even the Controller of Fate can do nothing.*\n\nThose who cling to it cannot be called *virtuous or moral.*\nChasing delusion, they lose the true.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs* says: *What humans may preserve is life; what is lamentable is the body; what may be stored is qi; what is precious is essence.*\n\nAs for massage and guiding qi, ingesting qi and consuming mist, closing doors to circulate qi, controlling women to absorb yin, visualizing thoughts and raising intentions, abstaining from grain and forsaking wives—\nall such secondary methods—\n\nSu Zhan said: *If it is not truly mine, not even a hair’s breadth should be taken.*\n\n**Chapter Five: Manifesting Without Limit**\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao said: All beings fail to attain the true Dao because they possess deluded minds. They covet what they love and know no rest.\n\nThe *Scripture of Clarifying the Mind* states: The mind is the origin of the Dao; the mind is the root of calamity.\n\nAn earlier perfected one said: Mortals value fine silks for their bodies and feast on delicacies; their eyes are bewitched by wanton colors, their ears confounded by lewd sounds. What they yearn for is glory, wealth, and honor—each day they sink deeper into delusion. How could they know of the profound mystery between Heaven and Earth?\n\nMaster Yin Shou said: Delusion’s clouds lock the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\n\nOnce the deluded mind arises, it startles the spirit. The eyes see and the heart stirs; the ears hear and the spirit wanders.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master said: When the mind gives rise to dharmas, qi scatters and the spirit departs.\n\nMaster Cao said: This thing has no fixed place—it transforms with the mind’s intent. In the body, when it senses heat, it becomes sweat; in the nose, when it meets wind, it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when stirred by passion, it becomes essence; in the eyes, when moved by sorrow, it becomes tears. Flowing and turning within qi and blood, in the end it never leaves spirit and qi.\n\nThe Venerable Celestial Master said: If the spirit departs, draw it back; when the spirit returns to the body, qi naturally returns. Thus, morning and evening, the red child gives birth to the true embryo.\n\nOnce the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao gives them life.\nZhong Hui said: When spirit and qi scatter, they become the myriad things.\nLaozi said: The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang.\nBai Yuchan said: This Dao constantly abides within the myriad things—what thing is not within this Dao?\nMaster Wu Zhen said: Yin and yang in grasses and trees are also paired; if one is lacking, they cannot flourish. First, green leaves open as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers bloom as yin follows. The constant Dao is but this in daily use—who knows the turning of the true source? I say to those who study the Dao: do not mock what you do not understand of yin and yang.\n\nOnce they cling to the myriad things,\nVirtue nurtures them.\nPerfected Master Yin said: Those who are good at my Dao know Heaven within a single thing and exhaust the spirit to fulfill destiny.\nMaster Shao said: A single thing comes with a body; within that body is another heaven and earth. You must know that the myriad things are complete within me—how could the Three Powers be established apart from this root?\n\nThen they give rise to greed and desire.\nDay by day, renew; again, renew each day.\nXu Jingyang said: Once my elixir is complete, transformations are free and unbounded. What I lack is only the Celestial Mandate’s decree. Thus, I accumulate merit to await the true mandate.\nPerfected Master Qiu said: When the elixir turns, cherish and nurture it; for three years, guard against danger and disgrace. Aid others, benefit things, and accumulate hidden merit—then you may tread the void and ascend to receive the Celestial Register.\n\nOnce greed and desire arise, there is only affliction.\nWithin the twelve hours, guard fullness and hold abundance.\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: Immortals and Daoists are not divine—they become true by accumulating essence and piling up qi.\nZhuangzi said: What does not depart from essence is called spirit.\nYun Fang said: The initial work is easy, but steadfast resolve is hard—naturally, the clouds part. The golden liquid and returning elixir are known here; seek them not outside the body. The Yellow Matchmaker pairs with you; when the golden crucible refines the elixir, it glows crimson. Cultivate yourself; cherish yourself. Yang begins at the head, yin at the spine. This alone is the metal within water—seek nothing else. The golden elixir is but a hundred days’ work; when complete, you will forever be a Penglai elder.\n\nAfflictions and deluded thoughts—images in the mind, spirits in dreams.\nXu Jingyang said: Abide in stillness, settle the spirit, and let no stray thoughts arise.\nYun Fang said: In stillness, you may see splendid images and manifold pleasures—do not acknowledge them, for they are deluded thoughts.\nImmortal Li said: Preserve the spirit, nurture qi and essence; purify and still the mind’s light. If deluded thoughts do not arise in vain, the true Dao may be attained.\n\nWorry and suffering for body and mind—\nIn movement and stillness, sitting and lying, guard it as you would an infant.\nPrince Wang Qiao said: When the mind is without action, the body is naturally at peace.\nDuke Cao said: I urge you to cherish body and mind.\nMaster Shao said: The body comes after Heaven and Earth; the mind comes before them. Heaven and Earth emerge from me—what else is worth mentioning?\n\nThen they encounter defilement and disgrace, drifting through the cycles of life and death. Noble and base, high and low—life and death are equal.\nMaster Pei Qingxu said: Defilement and disgrace are greed and delusion.\nLaozi said: Those who know contentment are not disgraced. Arrogance in wealth and honor brings one’s own misfortune.\nWang Panshan said: A single thought of non-arising is non-dying.\nLi Huayang said: Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of qi.\nGuo Pu said: Life and death, gathering and scattering—transformations are boundless.\nMaster Yuxi said: When the heart harbors emotion and nature bears dust, dust and emotion play their games, and life and death never cease.\nAn earlier perfected one said: The unborn and undying are the original true; the priceless night-glowing pearl is unrecognized. Mortals waste thousands of lives, mixed in the ore, unable to emerge. Forever sinking in the sea of suffering, they eternally lose the true Dao.\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and qi perishes, qi’s demise brings the spirit’s extinction.\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: The body’s essence and spirit must not be lost.\n\nLong ago, Xu Jingyang and his disciples arrived at a market—now called the Charcoal Woman Market. As dusk fell, he transformed charcoal into beautiful women to test them. Only Zhou and ten others remained unstained, all ascending to Heaven; the rest were moved in their hearts, enchanted and sinking into the sea of desire. At dawn, they saw it was only charcoal. Each knew they had lost the Dao and departed in shame.\n\nLord Yin said: Do not shun gain and loss—cultivate with single-minded resolve, and the returning elixir may be hoped for.\nAn Qisheng said: A thousand days of nurturing are insufficient; a single day of harm is too much.\n\nThe Dao of true constancy—those who awaken attain it themselves.\nIf you attain it within this mystery of mysteries—\nXu Jingyang said: The Dao of true constancy takes loyalty and filial piety as the source of all conduct and expedient means as the root of all goodness.\n\nWater Qiuzi said: Unchanging and unerring—this is called true constancy.\n*The Original Biography of the Dark Emperor* states: Loyalty complete and filial piety perfected—these ensure promotion to transcendence.\n*The Scripture of Limpid Clarity* states: May my children ever hold filial devotion in their hearts. At home, they serve their parents; in court, they are loyal to their lord. They do not engage in avaricious or lustful conduct, nor dissipate essence and spirit. Blessings flow like a spring, naturally clear and ceaseless.\n\nMaster Zitong said: Daily conduct is all the Dao; unwavering persistence is all the Dao.\nBai Yuchan said: The ordinary mind is the Dao—no need for discriminating thought.\n\nGuangchengzi said: The essence of the supreme Dao is subtle and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure—do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence, and you may attain longevity. Guard within, seal without—excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I abide in unity to dwell in harmony, thus I have lived twelve hundred years and my form has never aged. Those who attain my Dao ascend to sovereignty; those who lose it descend to dust. I shall now depart from you, entering the gate of the boundless, roaming the limitless wilds, sharing radiance with the sun and moon, and enduring with Heaven and Earth. All others will perish, yet I alone shall remain.\n\nDo you understand?\nDanyangzi said:\nA single spark of numinous light illumines the vast void—\nNo painter’s hand, however skilled, could ever capture it.\nDo not idly compare it to the bright moon,\nFor what is flawed and conditioned cannot resemble me.\n\nThose who awaken to the Dao—\nBeyond this mystery of mysteries, there is no further mystery.\n\nZhuangzi said: The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted; it lies beneath the Supreme Ultimate yet is not profound. It existed before Heaven and Earth yet is not ancient; it endures beyond high antiquity yet is not aged.\n\nXiweishi attained it and thereby grasped Heaven and Earth;\nFuxishi attained it and thereby embraced the Mother of Qi;\nThe Dipper attained it and thus remains unerring through all ages;\nThe sun and moon attained it and thus never cease their course;\nKanpi attained it and thereby inherited Kunlun;\nFeng Yi attained it and thereby dwells in the Dark Palace;\nYuqiang attained it and thereby stands at the North Pole;\nThe Queen Mother attained it and thereby sits upon Shaoguang.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master attained it, ascending in three generations and achieving liberation in seven;\nXu Jingyang attained it, raising his entire household into the void;\nWei Yuanjun attained it, ascending to the Purple Void;\nMaster Ge the Immortal attained it and ascended, his wife achieving liberation, his daughter likewise;\nMaster Liu of Dongtian attained it and ascended, his wife achieving liberation, his daughter likewise.\n\nThese are but a few examples. As for the ranks of immortals who awakened to the great Dao—their ends are beyond knowing.\n\nThe Way is ever pure and still.\n\n○ Heaven and earth unite in their virtue; sun and moon unite in their brightness.\nMaster Yin the Perfected says: \"Simply keep the mind long guiding qi, and qi will unite with spirit. With the center thus governed, the form endures forever. Like the sun and moon in their revolutions, like the turning of the celestial river, life becomes boundless and infinite—this is the attainment of the unfathomable Dao of emptiness, the realization of sagely wisdom and perfect comprehension. Concealed or revealed, moving between being and non-being, one roams the clouds at ease, ascending through the Golden Gate. Form and spirit merge in subtlety, uniting with the true Dao.\"\n\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* says:\n*\"Maidens of the ten directions hold banners and streamers,\nA hundred spirits array their chariots, jade lads follow.\nBefore them, dragon pennants; behind them, flags unfurled—\nFeathered robes fluttering, they ascend to the Great Tenuity.\"*\n\nThus concludes the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* spoken by the Most High Lord Lao.\n\n○ \"Be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure.\"\nNow that the scripture has been expounded, what of the final, most wondrous phrase? How is it to be understood?\n\nLü Dongbin says:\n*\"The Dao is subtle and profound, its celestial mechanism deep and distant.\nEven hastening to cultivate is already too late.\nThe path to Penglai—three thousand steps fulfilled—\nOne strides alone, returning upon the clouds.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan says:\n*\"For your sake, I speak this final phrase—\nThe very last word is personally entrusted.\nFor all under heaven who study immortality,\nIt clearly points the way to Penglai.\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty; within emptiness, being is set in motion.\nThus it is called 'wondrous being,' also 'true emptiness.'\nVast and unfathomable—why need scriptures?\nYet without scriptures, the Dao cannot be made clear.\nThus the Primordial Beginning unfolded the charts, spreading forth the five sections.\nThe true writ was revealed, disclosing the secret—\nRightly a ladder and raft, universally ferrying sentient beings.\nAmong them, the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* is truly essential,\nThe great principle of returning cinnabar made manifest.\nWhat is called purity? Not a speck of dust clings—thus it is pure.\nWhat is called stillness? All conditions cease—thus it is still.\nIf one can be constantly pure and still, one naturally merges with the mysterious Dao,\nDirectly transcending to the other shore.\"*\n\nAlas! Worldly people cling to all manner of appearances, suffering endless afflictions. Though they wish to transcend, even if they delight in this scripture, merely reciting its words, they ultimately fail to awaken to its meaning. Their lives pass in confusion, utterly without attainment.\n\nI once obtained the *Chaptered Corrections of Errors* by the Purple Clarity Perfected Bai, and the *Annotated Exegesis* by Sima Zimei—each word penetrating the subtle, each phrase illuminating the principle. Truly, these are the compass for cultivating the real. Fearing the gradual loss of these texts, I have had them block-printed to broaden their transmission. If one encounters a man with the eye of wisdom, he will be able to see through the mystery, smashing the barriers—how different from parting the clouds to behold the sun, or meeting Laozi face to face? Having reached this point, one forgets both purity and turbidity, movement and stillness become one. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—all is purity and stillness. White clouds and flowing water, green mountains and bright moon—even one who tosses back his beard and lets out a long cry does so in purity and stillness. Vivid and free, like a pearl spinning on a plate—how could this be mere stagnation in withered wood and dead ashes?\n\nThus is the teaching of purity and stillness expounded.\nRespectfully inscribed by Wang Daxu of Mount Juqu.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"The valley spirit does not die—it is called the mysterious female.\nThe gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\nThe mysterious female is the unity of yin and yang; yin and yang are the unity of heaven and earth. In the *Book of Changes*, Qian is the \"mysterious\" heaven, Kun is the \"female\" earth. By analogy, within the human body—a single heaven and earth—life and kidneys divide left and right into yin and yang: this is the mysterious female of the human being. Between the life-kidneys—is this not its gate? Is this not the root of heaven and earth?\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* originally holds that movement and stillness are principle. Bai Yuchan, in his exegesis, placed an illustrated diagram at the front to clarify this meaning. For this scripture is to be realized within the square inch of the heart—it is not mere learning for the mouth and ears.\n\nI have often said that the Confucians speak of nature and life, the Buddhists of embryonic breathing, and the Daoists of the mysterious female—though their names differ, their principle is one. Yet how lamentable that people of this world, under the guise of Confucianism, scheme for advancement; or invoke the words of Buddha and Laozi to delude others with the promise of blessings and merit—could this have been the original intent of those who established these teachings? Seeing Bai Yuchan’s transmission of this scripture and its diagram, one should blush with shame—this is not only for those who follow Laozi.\n\nWang Dashu and Shi Dawen obtained this scripture and had it block-printed; their aspiration is worthy of esteem. Thus I have written this colophon.\nIn the first year of the Huangqing era, after the Shangsi festival.\n\nInscribed by Jiang Huazi of Jintan, the Venerable Hermit of Fourfold Clarity.",

With but a word from me, I can make the poor rich and the lowly noble.\"\n\nIn an instant, the Venerable Man clapped his hands and leapt into a seated posture, rising gently into the void like a cloud ascending, hovering over a hundred *zhang* above the earth before coming to rest in the boundless emptiness. After a long while, he bowed slightly and replied: \"Now I ascend not to heaven, am not burdened by men, and do not dwell upon the earth—what subject am I to you? How then can Your Majesty make me rich or poor, noble or base?\"\n\nThe Emperor then understood and recognized him as a divine being. He alighted from his carriage and prostrated himself in reverence, offering his apologies. The Venerable Man bestowed upon him the essential teachings of the *Dao* and *Virtue* in two scriptures.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Cheng, he descended to the springs of Quyang and transmitted the *Scripture of Supreme Peace* to Yu Ji. In the time of Emperor Zhang of the Han, he imparted to Yu Ji the *One Hundred and Eighty Great Precepts*. Under Emperor An, he revealed to Liu Tu the *New Code of Sin and Fortune*. During the reign of Emperor Shun, he descended to confer upon the Celestial Master the *Catalogue of the Three Caverns*. In the era of Emperor Huan, he descended upon Mount Tiantai and bestowed upon Ge Xiaoxian the various scriptures of *Highest Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Great Cavern*. In the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, he descended upon Mount Song and transmitted to the Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi the *New Code of Talismans and Registers*. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu of the Great Tang, he descended upon Yangjiao Mountain and spoke to Ji Shanxing, instructing him to receive the Mandate Talisman. In the first year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Ming, he descended at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, and the Emperor personally received him at the Xingqing Palace. He also descended to speak with Tian Tongxiu, revealing the *Golden Casket of Numinous Talismans* hidden at the Hangu Pass. Further, he descended to instruct Wang Yuanyi in the *Wondrous Treasure of True Talismans*.\n\nIn the second year of the Zhenghe era of the Song, he descended upon the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and transmitted to Master Liang the *Extended Sentences of the Heavenly Child Scripture for Protecting Life*. It is also said: \"The Venerable Lord appears in every age, transforming and teaching before the kalpas of dust, enduring beyond the infinite, now hidden, now manifest—his transformations are boundless. He acts without contrivance, abiding in spontaneity, eternally enduring. He silently upholds the imperial order, profound beyond profundity. His universal deliverance of heaven and humanity cannot be fully recounted.\"\n\nMaster Chongzhen said: \"Regarding the principles of nurturing life and cultivating nature, the essential method lies in preserving the Three and embracing the One. The Three are essence, *qi*, and spirit—these are called the Three Treasures.\"\n\nThe Old Man of Xiangchuan said: \"Essence generates *qi*, *qi* generates spirit. These govern the flourishing and defense of the body—nothing is greater than this, for they are the true foundation of cultivation.\"\n\n*The Diagram of the Three Treasures of the Primordial Origin*\nTan Jingsheng said: \"To preserve the Three and embrace the One is to refine essence into *qi*, refine *qi* into spirit, and refine spirit to merge with the Dao, penetrating the wondrous spontaneity of nature.\"\n\nThe scripture states: \"Heaven has Three Treasures: the sun, moon, and stars. Humans have Three Treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit. The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes as sight; the essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears as hearing; the ethereal soul of the spleen manifests in the nose as smell; the corporeal soul of the gallbladder manifests in the mouth as speech. When one spirit moves, all spirits move; when one aperture opens, all nine apertures open. If one gate is securely locked, all gates are firm—turning the body, the true path becomes effortless.\"\n\n*The Diagram of Inner Observation for the Initial Realization of Stillness and Stability*\n*The Diagram of the Great Way of the Golden Elixir*\nBai Yuchan said: \"The heart without a heart has no form; within the formless, nurture the numinous infant. When the study of immortality reaches the state of the infant, the moon shines bright in the cold pool’s stillness.\"\n\n*Transmission of Scriptures and Verification of the Dao*\nThe Immortal Ge Xuan said: \"I obtained this Dao after reciting the scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heaven and humanity; it is not transmitted to the unworthy. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Tower, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it. Those of superior attainment who awaken to it ascend as officials of heaven; those of middling attainment become immortals of the Southern Palace; those of lesser attainment who obtain it enjoy long life in the world, roaming the Three Realms and ascending through the Golden Gate.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Left Mystery said: \"Those who study the Dao and recite this scripture will be protected by the ten celestial benevolent spirits. Then, with the jade talisman guarding the spirit and the golden liquid refining the form, both form and spirit become wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Orthodox Unity said: \"Households possessing this scripture, if they awaken to its meaning, will be free from calamities and obstructions. All sages will guard their gates, their spirits will ascend to the upper realms, and they will pay homage to the Most Honored. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they will be received by the Lord Emperor. Those who recite and uphold it without ceasing will ascend amidst purple clouds.\"\n\n*Transmission of Scriptures*\nSu Shangqing said: \"A youth transmits the scriptures and inquires of the perfected; with a heartless response to the world, he abides in eternal peace. When the time comes to serve the scriptures, there will be a day of wind and clouds—then he shall ride the simurgh and tread the jade steps of the celestial court.\"\n\n*Opening the Scriptures*\nQiu Changchun said: \"Those who leave the household have a dharma saying: 'Be loyal to the sovereign above, filial to parents below.' Those who neither bow to the sovereign above nor to parents below are neither loyal nor filial. Such self-aggrandizing and self-exalting words do not accord with the great Dao and make entry into the immortal lineage difficult—they have forgotten their roots.\"\n\nMaster Yin said: \"Among the ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, loyalty and filial piety come first. In heaven and on earth, expediency is foremost.\"\n\n*Awakening*\nBai Yuchan said: \"Mulberry fields become seas, seas become fields—in a single instant, a hundred years pass. If you turn the pivot at the crown of the head, who among you is not a Perfected of the Great Mystery?\"\n\n*Enlightened Master*\nWu Zhenzi said: \"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without meeting an enlightened master, do not force guesses. For the golden elixir has no oral transmission—where then can you bind the numinous embryo?\"\n\n*Oral Transmission*\nLiao Zhenzi said: \"The great medicine consists of three: essence, *qi*, and spirit—naturally, mother and child are mutually intimate. Returning the wind to merge with the true body, the work of refinement renews day by day.\"\n\n*Practice of Merit*\nLiao Zhenzi said: \"Within the merit of no-merit, strive diligently in merit; beyond merit, no merit accords with sagely merit.\"",

The present edition omits the two characters *Tai Shang*.)\n\nThe *Daode Jing* states: “The Dao as it emerges from the mouth is bland, seemingly without flavor. Looked for, it cannot be seen; listened for, it cannot be heard; used, it cannot be exhausted.”\n\nThe Fuxi Superior Man said: “Once you grasp the delight within the zither, why labor over the sound upon the strings?”\n\nThe Great Dao is formless, the beginning of non-being. It gives birth to heaven and earth, requiring no arrangement—naturally so.\n\nThe *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Vast and formless, spirit and *qi* constitute the real. Spirit is not vague; *qi* is not misty. Spirit generates the myriad spirits; *qi* generates the myriad *qi*. The myriad spirits return to one; the myriad *qi* merge into one. Spirit is the mechanism of the Dao; *qi* is its pivot. As the mechanism shifts and the pivot transforms, the Three Realms come into being. The Primordial Ancestral Spirit generates the myriad perfected; the Primordial Ancestral *Qi* transforms the various heavens.”\n\nThe Great Dao is without sentiment, the beginning of being. It sets the sun and moon in motion. The numinous treasure of pure clarity illumines without end.\n\nThe *Jin Astronomic Treatise* states: “Heaven is round like an inverted canopy; earth is square like a chessboard. Half the celestial sphere lies above the earth, half below. The sun and moon originally move eastward, while heaven rotates westward.”\n\nThe *Han Armillary Sphere* states: “The celestial sphere measures 365¼ degrees. Its body is round like a pellet, higher in the north and lower in the south, resembling an inverted canopy. The north celestial pole rises 36 degrees above the earth; the south celestial pole sinks 36 degrees below. The straight-line distance between the south and north poles is slightly less than 182 degrees. Following the curvature of the celestial sphere, the distance between the poles is slightly more than 182 degrees, precisely at the center of heaven. Midway between the north and south poles lies the equator, 91 degrees from each pole. At the spring equinox, the sun travels along the equator. At the summer solstice, it moves 24 degrees north of the equator, 67 degrees from the north pole and 115 degrees from the south pole—this is called the ‘black path.’ After the summer solstice, the sun gradually moves southward; at the autumn equinox, it returns to the equator, as at the spring equinox. At the winter solstice, it travels 24 degrees south of the equator, 67 degrees from the south pole and 115 degrees from the north pole—this is called the ‘yellow path.’ After the winter solstice, the sun gradually moves northward again. Moreover, the moon’s path closely parallels the sun’s, crossing it at two points. Half lies within the sun’s path, half outside. Where they intersect, the two paths coincide; at their farthest separation, they diverge by six degrees. Such is the general outline of the sun and moon’s movements.”\n\nThe *Han Records* state: “The sun moves one degree per day; the moon moves 13⁷⁄₁₉ degrees per day. The sun moves slowly, the moon swiftly. The sun is fundamentally yang; the moon is fundamentally yin. The moon cannot illuminate itself but relies on the sun for brightness. When it conjoins with the sun, it becomes dark (new moon); when it opposes the sun, it becomes full. Its waxing follows a sequence: after three days, a crescent appears—hence it is called *fěi*. After eight days, the moon has traversed 84¼ degrees, and its brightness reaches half—hence it is called the ‘first quarter.’ After fifteen days, it is called the ‘full moon,’ for it faces the sun and shines fully. After sixteen days, the lunar essence (*pò*) begins to grow, as the yin essence waxes and brightness wanes. After twenty-three days, the lunar essence reaches half—hence it is called the ‘last quarter.’ After 27½ days, the moon has traversed 365 degrees, completing its celestial circuit, while the sun has moved 27 degrees ahead. Thus, the moon must travel another 2½ days to rejoin the sun at the next new moon.”\n\nIt further states: “Earth resides at the center while heaven revolves around it. When the sun is above the earth, it is day; when below, night. Such is the path of the sun and moon’s movement.”\n\nThe *Divine Empyrean Scripture* states: “Once chaos divided, the Brahma-*qi* expanded. The great became the sun and moon; the fine became the stars.”\n\nMaster Yunfang said: “The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang, giving birth to and completing the myriad things. Rising in the east and setting in the west, they divide day and night; moving south and north, they determine cold and heat.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “Kunlun is vast beyond all bounds, its depths and expanse immeasurable. Yin and yang never cease their movement; cold and heat alternate in their coming and going.”\n\nThe Great Dao is nameless, the origin of the myriad images. It nurtures the myriad things. The two *qi* intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: “The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: “The Way of earth is to contain and radiate vastness. The myriad things rely on it for birth. It is stirred by thunder and nourished by wind and rain.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The Supreme Harmony spreads through all beings; the Benefit and Perseverance secure the numinous root. Without sincerity, nothing exists; the five natures truly abide herein. I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao.”\n\nThe Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate said: “The Limitless merges with the Great Dao in transformation, establishes the root of heaven and earth, distributes *qi* throughout the ten directions, and embraces the utmost purity of virtue and power. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named.” Thus, Laozi called it the Dao; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* called it the Origin; the *Book of Changes* called it the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “From *qi* transformation arises the name of the Dao.” He also said: “From *qi* transformation arise the names of the Way of heaven, the Way of earth, and the Way of man.”\n\nChen Zi’ang said: “Confucius expounded the Supreme Ultimate; Laozi prized the profound and obscure. The Golden Immortals of the West revere righteousness, yet it is ignorance.”\n\n**Chapter Two: The Naturalness of Creation**\n\nAs for the Dao, before *qi* was manifest, there was clarity—the beginning of yang *qi*; there was turbidity—the beginning of yin *qi*. There was movement and stillness. Yang moves and yin is still, giving rise to the Three Powers. Heaven is clear and earth is turbid: clear *qi* becomes heaven, turbid *qi* becomes earth. Heaven moves and earth is still. Heaven is round and moves, enveloping the earth without. Earth is square and still, situated within heaven. Man is clear and woman is turbid; man moves and woman is still.\n\n☰ The male and ☷ the female unite and give birth. Descending from root to branch, they generate the myriad things.\n\n☰☷☳ The Three Powers give birth to the myriad things.\n\n*Guanzi* said: “That which is empty and formless is called the Dao.”\n\nThe *Han Treatise on Harmonics and Calendrics* states: “The primordial *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate contains the Three as One”—that is, heaven, earth, and man.\n\n*Liezi* said: “The light and clear *qi* of the primordial *qi* becomes heaven; the heavy and turbid becomes earth; the harmonious and balanced *qi* becomes man.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “When the *qi* of heaven and earth combine, they encounter the transformations of cold and heat, dryness and dampness, wind and fire in their alternating dominance. Thus, human *qi* follows them, and the myriad things are transformed and born. All arises from the union and dispersion of the three *qi*, generating endless transformations.”\n\nMaster *Wu Zhen* said: “The Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One *qi*; from the One *qi* emerge yin and yang. Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies; the Three Bodies give rise to the flourishing of the myriad things. Clarity is the source of solitude; movement is the foundation of stillness.”\n\nShaozi said: “From the Limitless arises the Supreme Ultimate, in the undifferentiated vastness. Yang moves and yin is still—all within the Supreme Ultimate. Yang moves and yin is still, endlessly circulating. The original substance of the Supreme Ultimate resides within yin and yang.”\n\nThe Buddha said: “Water flows, yet its source is the sea; the moon sets, yet it does not leave the sky.” (Another version reads: “Stillness is the foundation of movement.”)\n\n“If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return.”\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: “Man is born with the form of heaven.”\n\nLi Shaowei said: “I am heaven and earth; heaven and earth are I.”\n\nMaster Liu said: “The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it. If one can empty the heart, the Dao will naturally return.”\n\nMaster Yuxi said: “Why is this heart connected to great creation? Only because it originally comes from the Dao.”\n\n**Chapter Three: Uniting Spirit with the Dao**\n\nThe human spirit favors clarity, yet the heart disturbs it. The Dao is originally without demons; it is the human heart that creates obstacles.\n\nMaster Yuxi said: “From the Dao divides my original spirit; my original spirit is the Great Dao itself.”\n\nMaster Wang the Shoemaker said: “When the heart is at peace, the spirit is numinous; when the heart is scattered, the spirit is wild.”\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: “May I inquire about the supreme Dao?”\n\nLao Dan replied: “Dredge and cleanse the heart; bathe and purify the spirit.”\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: “If sounds and colors do not cease, the spirit will not be clear. If thoughts and worries do not cease, the heart will not be at peace. When the heart is not at peace, the spirit is not numinous; when the spirit is not numinous, the Dao is not achieved.”\n\nThe human heart favors stillness, yet desires pull it away. “The Dao rises one foot; demons rise ten.” The True Lord of Heavenly Plans said: “Though the sun and moon are bright, floating clouds cover them; though rivers are clear, sand and stones muddy them; though the human heart is still, desires pull it away.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord of Zitong said: “White clouds are originally without intent; the wind sends them drifting from the peaks.”\n\nIf one can constantly dispel desires, the heart will naturally be still. With intent unobstructed and heart at ease, *qi* is robust and the spirit at peace.\n\nThe *Scripture of Perfect Realization* states: “Few desires, heart still; forget emotions, burdens light.”\n\nLaozi said: “Its dwelling is deep and still—is this not the human heart?”\n\nThe *Scripture of Water and Fire* states: “Desire arises from the heart; stillness comes from settling the heart. Heart and breath depend on each other; when breath is regulated, the heart is still.”\n\nWhen the heart is settled, the spirit naturally becomes clear. The cosmos radiates light, and demon kings bow their heads.\n\nMaster Yanluo said: “Settle the heart.” When the heart is settled and the spirit still, chaotic thoughts do not arise, perverse delusions do not invade, and worries and anxieties all vanish. “An empty room generates brightness”—this depends solely on settling the heart.\n\nLü Dongbin said: “One day of leisure is one day as an immortal; when the six spirits harmonize, one is naturally at peace. The cinnabar field holds treasure—why seek the Dao? Face circumstances without intent—why ask about Chan?”\n\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise, and the three poisons are extinguished. The yin *po* dissipates, and the yang spirit manifests.\n\nBai Yuchan said: “Have you not seen that emptiness generates the natural? The natural generates the One *qi*. The One *qi* congeals into things; when *qi* is sufficient, heaven and earth divide. Heaven and earth are originally without intent; the two *qi* are naturally so. The myriad things have flourishing and decay; great destinies have endings and beginnings. If you comprehend the original naturalness of the prior heaven, you grasp the true root of nature and life.”\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* of five thousand words, the *Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman*. Form and spirit, nature and life, body and heart, spirit and *qi*. Their interaction and fusion form the great treasure—this is the principle of the golden elixir. The worldly often cling to things, provisionally taking “having action” as the return to “non-action.”",

      "translated_text": "At three hundred days, his eyes gleamed like lacquer dots, his skin smooth as congealed lard; all long-standing ailments dissolved, and body and mind felt light and refreshed. Thus one knows the wondrous formulas of the immortals’ scriptures are no empty words.\n\nShi Xinglin said:\n*No speck clouds the heart-heaven,\nNo dust stirs on the nature-earth.\nIn the still night where the moon shines bright,\nA spring bird’s call rings clear.*\n\nIn true stillness, one responds to things—\n*Round and full, luminous and bright.*\n(An alternate version reads: *In true constancy, one responds to things.*)\n\nLaozi said: *There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.*\n\nLiu Haichan said: *He who only awakens to true nature and refrains from refining the elixir—know that through ten thousand kalpas, transformation remains arduous.*\n\nMaster Wang the Cobbler said: *When qi stills, spirit gathers; when spirit gathers, the elixir forms.*\n\n*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The Dao of the elixir is not forged from the five metals of the human realm, nor the eight minerals, cinnabar, or mercury. It is the merging of form with emptiness, vast and utterly void—this is called true emptiness. The body of true emptiness is the foundation of the returned elixir, the mother of the great medicine.*\n\n*What form does the mother of the great medicine take? What appearance, what substance? The substance is a thing within the formless, a thing that comes to dwell before the throne of the Emperor. The Emperor’s throne is true emptiness, united with spontaneity. True emptiness and spontaneity merge with form and image; form and image are set in motion by spirit. As true emptiness moves, it is not empty—its wondrous non-emptiness holds numinous power.*\n\nMaster Qiu said:\n*At the first turning of the elixir,\nIn the dark depths of the sea, a red sun rises.\nAuspicious clouds and mist fill the Three Fields,\nAnd a mysterious pearl, like a millet grain, is sown.*\n\n*At the second turning,\nThe flaming Vermilion Bird scorches heaven and earth.\nRosy light enters the crucible, tiger and dragon coil—\nA single grain of yellow sprout, like a dog’s tooth, appears.*\n\n*At the third turning,\nThe three powers blend their images to form the elixir.\nIts appearance, fair or plain, follows one’s intent—\nThe celestial essence that shapes the body has begun.*\n\n*At the fourth turning,\nThe sacred gate of Penglai’s isles remains ever sealed.\nIn stillness, the Wheel of Longevity turns in secret,\nAnd boundless numinous light illumines the true adept.*\n\n*At the fifth turning,\nThe numinous true one daily cultivates the immortal’s abode.\nLayer upon layer, the Dao’s qi augments its radiance,\nEver nourishing the lord of spirit and light.*\n\n*At the sixth turning,\nDay and night, the river chariot races along the sacred axle.\nThe numinous spring ascends to Kunlun’s peak—\nA wheel of moon bathes in the Jasper Pool.*\n\n*At the seventh turning,\nWithin the light of non-doing, the numinous essence is concealed.\nThe true officials uphold the Dao’s qi,\nAnd a thousand spirits descend with blessings to the spirit chamber.*\n\n*At the eighth turning,\nThe fetal immortal is refined, full as the moon.\nWalking together, sitting together, sleeping together,\nThough amid the dust, none recognize him.*\n\n*At the ninth turning,\nThe sacred work is complete, the fetal immortal perfected.\nHaving attained the body of freedom in emptiness,\nNo further firing is needed.*\n\nTrue constancy attains nature.\nThe wondrous one, the numinous presence,\nIs perfectly attuned across the Three Realms.\n\nLi Huayang said: *To neglect true nature and pursue only life-destiny—this is the foremost malady in cultivation.*\n\nNature is like a vessel: what it contains is like a precious pearl, and the light within the pearl is nature. When nature manifests, in the womb it becomes the body, in the world it becomes a person; in the eyes it is seeing, in the ears it is hearing, in the nose it smells fragrance, in the mouth it speaks; the hands move, the feet act—scattered, it fills the six directions; gathered, it resides in the square inch of the heart. The wise recognize it as true nature; the deluded mistake it for the hun-soul.\n\n*The Stone Casket Record* states: *The primal womb of father and mother cannot be discussed—vast and teeming, it births ten thousand kinds of souls. Conceived in the womb, born in moisture, transformed in the fourth month: humans, beasts, birds, insects—countless forms. Each is endowed with nature, and nature is linked to life-destiny, the soul bound to life. Fundamentally, humans and animals alike receive qi from the father and form from the mother. Following the hidden pattern of heaven and earth, when qi is sufficient, they are born, each with its proper nature and destiny. This principle is perfectly clear. Now, when practitioners speak of sitting transformation, if their thoughts err at the final moment, they lose their body and enter another womb. Truly, this is a warning!*\n\nMaster Xu Jing said: *The Dao is not far—it resides within the body. All things are empty, yet nature is not empty. If nature is not empty and unites with qi, qi returns to the primal sea, and life knows no end.*\n\nEver responsive,\nEver still,\nEver pure and still.\n\nMaster Hao said: *The body of concentration is without thought; the illumination of wisdom is boundless. When concentration and wisdom merge, wondrous function is infinite.*\n\nMaster Cao said: *Merge into one and then forget the one—you may emerge and submerge with the primal transformation. Piercing metal and stone is no difficulty; sitting liberation and standing transcendence are swift as a flash.*\n\nIn such purity and stillness,\nOne gradually enters the true Dao.\n*Mind and nature unstained,\nOne enters the gate of a myriad wonders.*\n\nMaster Han said: *The great Dao of emptiness and nothingness is pure, still, subtle, and recondite. Unstained is called pure; unmoving is called still; unseen is called subtle; unheard is called recondite. Diligently practice these four, and after three years, one escapes the wheel of rebirth.*\n\nHe also said: *When the six roots are pure and the square inch is limpid, with long practice, one may sit and command ghosts and spirits, summon wind and rain. How can this be taken lightly?*\n\nSa Shoujian said:\n*Autumn moon on a cold pond,\nGreen stream without a trace.*\n\nHaving entered the true Dao, one is called *attained the Dao.*\nThe mind is like empty space, yet empty space is not the mind.\n\nMaster Red Pine said: *Returning to nature, one enters emptiness; concentrating spirit, one enters primordial chaos.*\n\nThe ancients said: *Immortals are but mortals who have done it—this is called attaining the Dao.*\n\nXue Daoguang said: *The guests of Penglai’s three isles are not in the west.*\n\nThough called *attained the Dao,* if one’s manifestation of the Dharma is not true—\n\nLiu Haichan said: *The true mark is without mark, the wondrous Dharma-gate.*\n\nMaster Wu Zhen said: *Light at the nape is still illusion; clouds beneath the feet are not yet immortality.*\n\nTruly, there is nothing attained.\n*True Dharma does not manifest.*\nSeen, it cannot be seen—*it is without color.*\nHeard, it cannot be heard—*it is without sound.*\nGrasped, it cannot be grasped—*it is without form.*\n\nMaster Yuxi said: *To seek it in another’s heart is futile—it is neither within nor without, neither between.*",

      "translated_text": "The Most High Lord Lao said: All beings fail to attain the true Dao because they possess deluded minds. They covet what they love and know no rest.\n\nThe *Scripture of Clarifying the Mind* states: The mind is the origin of the Dao; the mind is the root of calamity.\n\nAn earlier perfected one said: Mortals value fine silks for their bodies and feast on delicacies; their eyes are bewitched by wanton colors, their ears confounded by lewd sounds. What they yearn for is glory, wealth, and honor—each day they sink deeper into delusion. How could they know of the profound mystery between Heaven and Earth?\n\nMaster Yin Shou said: Delusion’s clouds lock the moon of wisdom; karmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\n\nOnce the deluded mind arises, it startles the spirit. The eyes see and the heart stirs; the ears hear and the spirit wanders.\n\nThe Han Celestial Master said: When the mind gives rise to dharmas, qi scatters and the spirit departs.\n\nMaster Cao said: This thing has no fixed place—it transforms with the mind’s intent. In the body, when it senses heat, it becomes sweat; in the nose, when it meets wind, it becomes mucus; in the kidneys, when stirred by passion, it becomes essence; in the eyes, when moved by sorrow, it becomes tears. Flowing and turning within qi and blood, in the end it never leaves spirit and qi.\n\nThe Venerable Celestial Master said: If the spirit departs, draw it back; when the spirit returns to the body, qi naturally returns. Thus, morning and evening, the red child gives birth to the true embryo.\n\nOnce the spirit is startled, it clings to the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao gives them life.\nZhong Hui said: When spirit and qi scatter, they become the myriad things.\nLaozi said: The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang.\nBai Yuchan said: This Dao constantly abides within the myriad things—what thing is not within this Dao?\nMaster Wu Zhen said: Yin and yang in grasses and trees are also paired; if one is lacking, they cannot flourish. First, green leaves open as yang takes the lead; next, red flowers bloom as yin follows. The constant Dao is but this in daily use—who knows the turning of the true source? I say to those who study the Dao: do not mock what you do not understand of yin and yang.\n\nOnce they cling to the myriad things,\nVirtue nurtures them.\nPerfected Master Yin said: Those who are good at my Dao know Heaven within a single thing and exhaust the spirit to fulfill destiny.\nMaster Shao said: A single thing comes with a body; within that body is another heaven and earth. You must know that the myriad things are complete within me—how could the Three Powers be established apart from this root?\n\nThen they give rise to greed and desire.\nDay by day, renew; again, renew each day.\nXu Jingyang said: Once my elixir is complete, transformations are free and unbounded. What I lack is only the Celestial Mandate’s decree. Thus, I accumulate merit to await the true mandate.\nPerfected Master Qiu said: When the elixir turns, cherish and nurture it; for three years, guard against danger and disgrace. Aid others, benefit things, and accumulate hidden merit—then you may tread the void and ascend to receive the Celestial Register.\n\nOnce greed and desire arise, there is only affliction.\nWithin the twelve hours, guard fullness and hold abundance.\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: Immortals and Daoists are not divine—they become true by accumulating essence and piling up qi.\nZhuangzi said: What does not depart from essence is called spirit.\nYun Fang said: The initial work is easy, but steadfast resolve is hard—naturally, the clouds part. The golden liquid and returning elixir are known here; seek them not outside the body. The Yellow Matchmaker pairs with you; when the golden crucible refines the elixir, it glows crimson. Cultivate yourself; cherish yourself. Yang begins at the head, yin at the spine. This alone is the metal within water—seek nothing else. The golden elixir is but a hundred days’ work; when complete, you will forever be a Penglai elder.\n\nAfflictions and deluded thoughts—images in the mind, spirits in dreams.\nXu Jingyang said: Abide in stillness, settle the spirit, and let no stray thoughts arise.\nYun Fang said: In stillness, you may see splendid images and manifold pleasures—do not acknowledge them, for they are deluded thoughts.\nImmortal Li said: Preserve the spirit, nurture qi and essence; purify and still the mind’s light. If deluded thoughts do not arise in vain, the true Dao may be attained.\n\nWorry and suffering for body and mind—\nIn movement and stillness, sitting and lying, guard it as you would an infant.\nPrince Wang Qiao said: When the mind is without action, the body is naturally at peace.\nDuke Cao said: I urge you to cherish body and mind.\nMaster Shao said: The body comes after Heaven and Earth; the mind comes before them. Heaven and Earth emerge from me—what else is worth mentioning?\n\nThen they encounter defilement and disgrace, drifting through the cycles of life and death. Noble and base, high and low—life and death are equal.\nMaster Pei Qingxu said: Defilement and disgrace are greed and delusion.\nLaozi said: Those who know contentment are not disgraced. Arrogance in wealth and honor brings one’s own misfortune.\nWang Panshan said: A single thought of non-arising is non-dying.\nLi Huayang said: Life and death are but the gathering and scattering of qi.\nGuo Pu said: Life and death, gathering and scattering—transformations are boundless.\nMaster Yuxi said: When the heart harbors emotion and nature bears dust, dust and emotion play their games, and life and death never cease.\nAn earlier perfected one said: The unborn and undying are the original true; the priceless night-glowing pearl is unrecognized. Mortals waste thousands of lives, mixed in the ore, unable to emerge. Forever sinking in the sea of suffering, they eternally lose the true Dao.\n\nWhen essence is exhausted and qi perishes, qi’s demise brings the spirit’s extinction.\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: The body’s essence and spirit must not be lost.\n\nLong ago, Xu Jingyang and his disciples arrived at a market—now called the Charcoal Woman Market. As dusk fell, he transformed charcoal into beautiful women to test them. Only Zhou and ten others remained unstained, all ascending to Heaven; the rest were moved in their hearts, enchanted and sinking into the sea of desire. At dawn, they saw it was only charcoal. Each knew they had lost the Dao and departed in shame.\n\nLord Yin said: Do not shun gain and loss—cultivate with single-minded resolve, and the returning elixir may be hoped for.\nAn Qisheng said: A thousand days of nurturing are insufficient; a single day of harm is too much.\n\nThe Dao of true constancy—those who awaken attain it themselves.\nIf you attain it within this mystery of mysteries—\nXu Jingyang said: The Dao of true constancy takes loyalty and filial piety as the source of all conduct and expedient means as the root of all goodness.",

How is it to be understood?\n\nLü Dongbin says:\n*\"The Dao is subtle and profound, its celestial mechanism deep and distant.\nEven hastening to cultivate is already too late.\nThe path to Penglai—three thousand steps fulfilled—\nOne strides alone, returning upon the clouds.\"*\n\nBai Yuchan says:\n*\"For your sake, I speak this final phrase—\nThe very last word is personally entrusted.\nFor all under heaven who study immortality,\nIt clearly points the way to Penglai.\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty; within emptiness, being is set in motion.\nThus it is called 'wondrous being,' also 'true emptiness.'\nVast and unfathomable—why need scriptures?\nYet without scriptures, the Dao cannot be made clear.\nThus the Primordial Beginning unfolded the charts, spreading forth the five sections.\nThe true writ was revealed, disclosing the secret—\nRightly a ladder and raft, universally ferrying sentient beings.\nAmong them, the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* is truly essential,\nThe great principle of returning cinnabar made manifest.\nWhat is called purity? Not a speck of dust clings—thus it is pure.\nWhat is called stillness? All conditions cease—thus it is still.\nIf one can be constantly pure and still, one naturally merges with the mysterious Dao,\nDirectly transcending to the other shore.\"*\n\nAlas! Worldly people cling to all manner of appearances, suffering endless afflictions. Though they wish to transcend, even if they delight in this scripture, merely reciting its words, they ultimately fail to awaken to its meaning. Their lives pass in confusion, utterly without attainment.\n\nI once obtained the *Chaptered Corrections of Errors* by the Purple Clarity Perfected Bai, and the *Annotated Exegesis* by Sima Zimei—each word penetrating the subtle, each phrase illuminating the principle. Truly, these are the compass for cultivating the real. Fearing the gradual loss of these texts, I have had them block-printed to broaden their transmission. If one encounters a man with the eye of wisdom, he will be able to see through the mystery, smashing the barriers—how different from parting the clouds to behold the sun, or meeting Laozi face to face? Having reached this point, one forgets both purity and turbidity, movement and stillness become one. In walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—all is purity and stillness. White clouds and flowing water, green mountains and bright moon—even one who tosses back his beard and lets out a long cry does so in purity and stillness. Vivid and free, like a pearl spinning on a plate—how could this be mere stagnation in withered wood and dead ashes?\n\nThus is the teaching of purity and stillness expounded.\nRespectfully inscribed by Wang Daxu of Mount Juqu.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"The valley spirit does not die—it is called the mysterious female.\nThe gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\nThe mysterious female is the unity of yin and yang; yin and yang are the unity of heaven and earth. In the *Book of Changes*, Qian is the \"mysterious\" heaven, Kun is the \"female\" earth. By analogy, within the human body—a single heaven and earth—life and kidneys divide left and right into yin and yang: this is the mysterious female of the human being. Between the life-kidneys—is this not its gate? Is this not the root of heaven and earth?\n\nThe *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* originally holds that movement and stillness are principle. Bai Yuchan, in his exegesis, placed an illustrated diagram at the front to clarify this meaning. For this scripture is to be realized within the square inch of the heart—it is not mere learning for the mouth and ears.\n\nI have often said that the Confucians speak of nature and life, the Buddhists of embryonic breathing, and the Daoists of the mysterious female—though their names differ, their principle is one. Yet how lamentable that people of this world, under the guise of Confucianism, scheme for advancement; or invoke the words of Buddha and Laozi to delude others with the promise of blessings and merit—could this have been the original intent of those who established these teachings? Seeing Bai Yuchan’s transmission of this scripture and its diagram, one should blush with shame—this is not only for those who follow Laozi.\n\nWang Dashu and Shi Dawen obtained this scripture and had it block-printed; their aspiration is worthy of esteem. Thus I have written this colophon.\nIn the first year of the Huangqing era, after the Shangsi festival.",
