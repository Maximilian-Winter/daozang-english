  "full_translation": "**Title: *Essentials of Longevity* (Chángshēng Zhǐyào Piān)**\n*Scripture Name: Essentials of Longevity*\nComposed by **Lin Zìrán** of the Southern Song.\nOne scroll.\nSource text: *Canonical Daoist Canon (Zhengtong Daozang)*, **Taixuan (Great Mystery) Section**\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Essentials of Longevity***\n\nIn my youth, I was afflicted by sorrow, my brush and ink neglected, and I grew weary of worldly tastes. Then, upon reading the *Scripture on Purity and Stillness (Qīngjìng Jīng)*, I awoke to self-examination. Thus, I abandoned my home with a resolute heart, clad in rags and barefoot, wandering and seeking across half the land. As for the practices of *visualizing the kidneys to nurture the heart* and *swallowing saliva to internalize qi*, I tried them all. Yet what lingered in my mind was the matter of *Golden Elixir (Jīndān)*, whose roots I had yet to fathom.\n\nThen, fate unfolded—**Master Lǚ Zhēnrén of Western Shu** appeared before me at the **Yānxīá Dàoyuàn** in Chángtíng. With joy, he entrusted me with the secrets of elixir refinement: the methods of *fire regulation, adding and reducing*, all as clear as the palm of my hand. For years now, I have followed his teachings with reverence!\n\nSeeing how common folk stray into convoluted side paths, ever farther from the Dao, I could not bear to keep these truths hidden. Thus, I expounded in subtle words, setting them down in seven chapters, naming this work *Essentials of Longevity (Chángshēng Zhǐyào)*. May those with sincere intent thereby attain enlightenment!\n\nWritten on the **Mid-Autumn Day of the Year *Chúnyóu Gēnxū*** (1250 CE),\nBy **Huíyáng Zǐ** Lin Zìrán\n\n---\n\n**Essentials of Longevity**\nNarrated by **Huíyáng Zǐ** Lin Zìrán\n**Chapter One**\n\n**Essentials of Longevity**\nNarrated by **Huíyáng Zǐ** Lin Zìrán\n**Chapter One**\n\nI have heard that the **Primordial Dao** lies within the **Hun-tun**—unfathomable by perception, ungraspable by cognition. Listen with the ears and hear with the eyes; see with the eyes and perceive with the ears. Vague and indistinct, dim and obscure, neither form nor image, yet named as **Dao**. The subtlety of the Dao being beyond measure, one must only gaze upward and downward to comprehend it. When aligned with the human body, it fits like matching seals.\n\nHaving attained the **mystery within the mystery**, the **subtlety within the subtlety**, I dare not keep it entirely concealed. Thus, from the realm of **Being and Non-Being**, I reveal its roots. The **Receptive (Yīn)** is the undivided black of **Hun-tun**, like the stem of a gourd, containing the true essence. The **black qi** permeates, blending with **Creation**,—is this not the marvel of **Taiyi** embracing the true **qi**?\n\nOnce the **Two Principles (Yīn-Yáng)** are distinguished, the **Four Symbols** emerge, and from them, the **Five Phases** manifest. Then the **Eight Trigrams** are arranged, with the **central palace** as their origin. The central palace is the domain of **Earth**. Thus, water finds stability in Earth, fire finds rest, metal finds life, and wood flourishes—like a child in its mother’s womb, nourished by the **primordial black qi** of Heaven and Earth, aligned with the central palace, breathing in unison. Once the embryo forms and the umbilical cord is severed, the received **true black qi** of Heaven and Earth, infused with the **Divine Sovereign’s spirit-qi**, merges with the primordial harmony, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, sharing in their transformation.\n\nYet when **emotions and desires** stir within and without, when **pleasures and attachments** arise, the **qi** separates from the true, the **original spirit** follows external allurements. Though it mingles with the **true qi** of Heaven and Earth, without a foundation for **transformation**, it is instead seized by them, causing the body to decay and the **qi** to fade—thus, death becomes inevitable.\n\nThis **qi** is the **Primordial Chaos’s ancestral breath**, the **source of immortal life and fate**. To possess it is to live; to lose it is to die. Those who attain it **plunder Heaven and Earth’s creation**; those who fail are **plundered by them**—what is lost is the **single point of original yang-qi**.\n\nPractitioners of cultivation, why not return to the **Root** and refine according to the seasons, forging the **Great Elixir**? The method of refinement is simple: inhale when the **Mother** exhales, exhale when the **Mother** inhales. Each inhalation draws **Heaven’s qi** downward; each exhalation raises **Earth’s qi** upward. Breathing follows its natural rhythm, not blindly forced—stir one spirit, and all spirits move; open one orifice, and all orifices open.\n\nSeekers of the Dao must trace its source, as if still within the **mother’s womb**, embracing the **Primordial**, guarding the **One**. **Taiyi** contains the true **qi**; Heaven and Earth nurture the **Yellow Sprout**. The **Yellow Sprout** is the **mother of Lead**—those who fail to cultivate see their **qi** severed, their life extinguished, unable to **reclaim the lost light** and reflect inward, fixated only on the external.\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **essence of Heaven and Earth** gathers in the **sun and moon**; the **essence of humanity** resides in the **eyes**. When a person takes form, the **kidneys** emerge first, corresponding to the **Wheel of Essence** within. Then the **eyes** form, like water droplets, mirroring Heaven and Earth in their purity. Before Heaven and Earth divided, before the **Two Luminaires** shone, all was **Hun-tun**, dim and obscure. When the **Two Principles** separated, the **Two Luminaires** illuminated, **water and fire** emerged, and all things were born—thus arises the marvel of **transformation**.\n\nTo cultivate, one must extract the **Primordial qi** beneath the **horizontal eyes**, seeking the **Heavenly-Earthly essence** and applying it. If this subtlety is mastered, it is called **soaring beyond sun and moon**, piercing the **Kunlun peaks**. Ancestors of the Dao taught no other path.\n\nThe **Yellow Court** is the **furnace and cauldron** where sacred deeds are forged, where **divinity** is born. **Pure above, turbid below**, the path connects the **Eight Waters**, ascending to the **Sea of Marrow**, regulating the **Five Qi**, blending the **Hundred Spirits**, descending to the **Gushing Spring**, cycling endlessly day and night. The **true essence of Heaven and Earth**, along with the **spirit without form**, may be united here. When the **ten months** of cultivation are complete, the **embryo is born**—smallly, it grants longevity and joy; greatly, it transcends humanity to sainthood. Wandering in transformation, unbound in Heaven and Earth, when virtue is complete, one ascends to the **Jade Emptiness Above**. Such alchemy is profound and wondrous—how can cultivators of the **Elixir** not devote themselves to the **Dao**?\n\n**Chapter Two**\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **Dao** and **Nature** are one continuous principle. Heaven, possessing **qi**, covers all below; Earth, possessing **substance**, supports all above. Between them lies **eighty-four thousand li**. **Qi** and **substance** cannot naturally intermingle—Heaven, through **Kàn**, reaches into **Kùn**, returning to Earth, its **yang** bearing **yīn** upward; Earth, through **Kùn**, reaches into **Kàn**, returning to Heaven, its **yīn** embracing **yang** downward. In this endless rise and fall, they never stray from the **Dao**, thus enduring forever. There is no other reason.\n\nMoreover, the **Nature of Heaven and Earth** is humanity’s most noble inheritance.\n\n**Chapter Two (continued)**\n\nThe **Heart** compares to Heaven and bears the name **Vermilion Bird**, manifesting in the eyes as **red veins**; the **Kidneys** compare to Earth and bear the name **Dark Warrior**, affecting the eyes with **essence-qi**. The **Liver**, as the **yang** position, is likened to the **Green Dragon**, its essence appearing green in the eyes; the **Lungs**, as the **yin** position, are likened to the **White Tiger**, their essence appearing white when seen.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s transformative forces converge entirely in the eyes. If one harmonizes them with clarity, the source of transformation is revealed—probing the **Kàn-Lì** phases, aligning with the dynamic rhythms of **symbols and correspondences**, day and night. With focused spirit and forgotten schemes, preserving light and embracing brightness, how could one fail to unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth?\n\nYet, from the moment humans separate from their parents, they are stained by the **six dusts**, their **Heavenly Five Qi** scattered and stripped away, their senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue—entangled by sounds and colors. Thoughts stray from their proper place; external openness leads to inner dimness. When obstructed by the **Yellow Center**, the body fractures, its completeness lost to a single crooked path. Turning away from the root to chase the superficial, they forget to return, and the **Dao-heart** is veiled, hidden and unseen!\n\nHow could they then unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth? Not only do they fail to unite, but they further corrupt it with change—until the **Original Yang** is depleted, the **True Qi** lost, all because external things blind the eyes, and **essence** floats above **nature**, daily expending its light outward.\n\nAlas! Why do those who study the **Dao** not awaken the depths of the *Yì* and reflect upon this?\n\nMoreover, when **Kùn’s** proper position enters **Kàn’s** proper position, adding two strokes within, it becomes **Kàn**—for **Kàn-water** is internally luminous. If one penetrates the luminous nature of water, clarity flows unimpeded; if one clings to the luminous nature of fire, darkness multiplies. For above and below are both **yang** strokes, only red remains—yet when **Yellow** resides centrally, light emerges. Thus, **Lì-fire** is red from beginning to end, but excessive redness turns black.\n\nWhat reliance can one place in this within humanity?\n\n「Thus, those who cling to the external luminosity—this is the principle of the *Yì*’s light illuminating the Western River. Those who do not return to its source—this is the meaning of the separation between gold and wood.\n\nOnly the enlightened ones, when encountering each and every realm, follow their perception and restore it, thereby seizing its luminosity and returning to its essence, thus preserving the **virtue/power** of **Kùn**. When one preserves their **virtue/power**, their **nature** does not stray; when **nature** does not stray, the **spirit** does not wander; when the **spirit** does not wander, the **essence** does not disperse; when the **essence** does not disperse, the **True Qi** gathers. When **True Qi** gathers, the **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem; when **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem, the myriad **spirits** align with the **Primordial Origin**. The three flowers converge at the crown, maintaining the **Great Harmony**, and one attains immediate transcendence, achieving the radiance of the **Nine Tripod Elixir**, piercing the **Void Realm**, and aligning with the **Pure and Clear** in its transformation. Only then does one reside before the **Great Primordial Chaos** of **Tàichū**.\n\nIf not so, even at the moment of blinking, distinctions between self and others arise!\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **Dao**’s natural course completes the twelve **Earthly Branches** and **Celestial Stems**, totaling ninety-six **kè** (moments). It encompasses all of heaven and earth, yet penetrates the finest hairs of autumn. The common folk, unaware, mistakenly insert four **kè** into the **Zǐ-wu-xǐ-yǒu** (Child-Midday-Mao-Western) cycle—this is all incorrect. Heaven and earth’s creation cannot be increased or diminished; to increase is to prolong, to diminish is to shorten. Heaven has ten **gān** (Celestial Stems), which are **yang** numbers, the root; earth has twelve **zhī** (Earthly Branches), which are **coupled** numbers, the end. The common folk follow the **Branches**, while sages follow the **Stems**; the remaining **kè** lie within them!\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said: *\"When the root descends and the end flows, the myriad things are born.\"* The root delves into the foundation and secures the origin; the end blooms and bears fruit. When the melon ripens, the stem detaches—its fragrance arises naturally. Only those who split the melon truly know its flavor.\n\nTo know: those who study the **Dao** must cultivate **spirit** and **Qi** fully. It is unnecessary to be bound by years, months, days, or **shí-chén** (times). This is the principle of *\"form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the **Dao** in truth.\"* Further, to delve into **nature**’s ultimate essence and ascend a step higher, one must attain **nature** and **life** as an indivisible whole, unrestricted in coming and going.\n\nAfter achieving **True Stillness**, a point of luminous **spirit** pierces the **Jade Pool**—this is the **Mysterious Feminine**. Before heaven and earth were differentiated, they were like a chicken egg, hence the **Primordial Origin** is contained within the **Great Primordial Origin**. Before **Huntingian Chaos** was resolved, heaven and earth first divided: the **Primordial** is the substance, the **Post-Primordial** is the function. The light and clear ascend as heaven, the heavy and turbid descend as earth; the center is the human body—this is the **Three Talents**, the fixed source of all things.\n\nInternally, the **Mysterious Feminine** is the root of heaven and earth; externally, it is the gateway of birth and death. Piercing the **Great Primordial Chaos**’s aperture, surging through the **Upper Vertex Pass**, boundless **immortals** emerge from here, and the myriad ages rank among the **Celestial Assembly**.\n\nThe teacher **Xiè** reveals the root and source: one escapes the cycle of **rebirth** and **samsara** externally, dwelling in mountains or cities with ease, hidden or revealed without obstruction in coming and going.\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: *\"From having arises non-having; from non-having arises having; from non-having emerges having; from having emerges non-having.\"* Thus, the *Xiāozāi Jīng* (Scripture of Eliminating Calamities) states: *\"Having having and non-having having, the end is ever dark and unclear, unable to self-illuminate.\"* Yet those who illuminate the mind and perceive **nature** differ from this—when non-having is non-having and having is having, it diverges from this.\n\nTherefore, **Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** (the **Purple Yang Sage**) said: *\"**True Stillness** floats and sinks, distinguishing guest and host.\"* The root is **nature** as host, and first, **life** is established. The verse says: *\"Though he be the guest, I am the host.\"* This is precisely the **floating and sinking of nature and life**.\n\nFor instance, the sun rises from the **Eastern Sea**, its auspicious **Qi** filling the sky, its rosy radiance dazzling. A hundred paces from the sea gate, its light begins to fade. As it nears its setting in the west, its radiance is reclaimed, returning to its origin—so too is this.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must understand this principle: scattering the **spirit**’s light, one pursues the myriad things. The common folk’s actions are thus, while sages follow perception and restore it, like the sun returning to its origin.\n\n**Cuī Gōng**’s entry into the **Medicine Mirror** is this very principle! Hence it is said: *\"The creation of heaven and earth is all gathered in the sun and moon; the creation of humanity is all gathered in the **Primordial Origin**.\"* Is this not the boundless transformation, enduring as long as heaven and earth?\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **sage’s embryo** matures in ten months, and the infant manifests. Those who study the **Dao** are like a person building a house: first, one must lay the foundation solidly before it can bear weight. Awaiting the birth of **heaven and earth’s single yang**, one takes the month from the year, the day from the month, the **shí-chén** from the day, and the **kè** from the **shí-chén**. When ten months complete the embryo’s circle, the work is fulfilled, and **virtue/power** is attained—just as the common folk, after a thousand days, finally separate from their mother’s milk, gaining autonomy. When **yin** and **yang** meet, the self’s body arises from their union—not sought externally. *\"Coming, clouds fill the thousand mountains; departing, the moon spans the ten thousand waters.\"*\n\nThose who study the **Dao** possess their own **sage father** and **sage mother**, their own **self-born father and mother**. I awaken to seven parts, the teacher refines three parts; I awaken to three parts, the teacher refines seven parts—totaling ten parts. One must awaken and perceive themselves to enter the **Dao**. According to one’s capacity, one accommodates others and bears fruit; the **wooden method** lies entirely in **cultivating the soil**.\n\nI see the world’s people, ever turning in confusion, failing to comprehend the sages’ classics. Once the human body is lost, they face countless kalpas to regain it. Is this not painful?\n\nThe **sea of suffering** is boundless—turning back is the path to liberation. It is not my intention now to speak bitterly in vain; I fear only that you may waste precious time. Instead, take it upon yourself to instantly awaken, transcend the mundane, and attain sainthood.\n\n**Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** said: *\"When a nation is wealthy and its people at peace, it seeks war; only after war does it see true tranquility.\"* A wealthy nation brings peace to its people; peaceful people enrich their nation. So too, when a person’s **Primordial Spirit**, **Primordial Darkness**, and **Primordial Essence** return to their proper abodes—the **spirit** to the **spirit chamber**, the **essence** to the **essence palace**, and the **Qi** to its **root**—if these three can return to their origins, then the nation is wealthy and its people at peace.\n\nFurther, if one penetrates this profound principle, it becomes the **Three Families Meeting** to form the **embryo of the sage**’s union. When two things meet, their **emotions** and **nature** merge. The **Tiger** and **Dragon** coil together at the center—this is the **soil**. **Wù** is **yang soil**, capable of generating the myriad things; **Jǐ** is **yin soil**, capable of nourishing the myriad things. Thus, the myriad things are born and grow—humanity is likewise.»\n\nThe **Venerable Purple Yang** says: *\"To long endure the blade and the cup of the sage, as winter snows gather and congeal—this is the very way.*\n\nThe laughing infant and the rosy maiden, the Yellow Mother guiding the Master Dīng,\npointing the path across the **Cao Stream**,\nascending the **Kunlun Peak**—\nthe surging waves descend into the **Yellow Court**,\nwhere **water** and **fire** meet in welcome.\n\n**Master Huiyang** says: *\"In this world, the **Spirit** is limited, but the body remains in excess.\nWealth, honor, and glory pass like fleeting blossoms—why weary the mind in pursuit?*\n\nI urge those who cultivate the **Dao** to awaken soon to this truth:\nfrom ancient times, all **Immortal Adepts** entered through this path.\nThe verse says:\n*'Nine ten-thousand branches green and red,\nYet in seasons one sees their roots and shoots—\nDo not say this fruit hard to ripen,\nFor it is watered by a single ladle from the **Sacred Source**.'*\n\nAnd another verse says:\n*'Treading all this world’s farthest shores,\nWhere does the Yellow Mother dwell?\nThe Master suddenly reveals the path—\nI chop my feet to reach the **Misty Peaks**.'*\n\n**Fourth,** **Master Huiyang** says: *\"The **Heaven** has four seasons, the Sun twelve hours—\neach hour holds its own profound use.\nThose who refine must know the **Spirit’s** hiding and its movements,\npast and future, to seize the moment.\nIts deepest mystery lies in piercing the years,\nclustered months, months clustered with days,\ndays clustered with hours, hours clustered with moments—\nlest even a hair’s breadth be lost.\n\nBut the method does not end there.\nOne must ascend to align with the **celestial movements** of stars and constellations,\ndescend to harmonize with the **ebb and flow** of ocean tides,\nharvest the **Qi** before **Heaven** and **Earth** divide,\nand steal the **Essence** where **Sun** and **Moon** converge.\nThus the sage says: *'When Heaven and Earth exchange their times, they also exchange their **Qi**—\nJust strike the door at the **Jia-Yi** moment.'*\n\nFor within each moment’s labor lies a day’s **Qi** and **timing**,\nwithin each day’s labor lies a year’s **Qi** and **timing**.\nOne who grasps a year’s labor\ncan seize the **Heaven’s** and **Earth’s** **three thousand six hundred years** of measure.\nHow can the **unawakened** presume to fathom this?\nThus the verse says:*\n\nThe *Fu* hexagram’s first line moves—\nHeaven’s heart shifts not.\nWithin this grasp of meaning,\nThe elixir’s foundation is laid.\n\n**Fifth Section:** Master Yangzi said:\nThe ancient sages transmitted the Great Elixir’s gold,\nYet withheld the fire’s timing—\nNot to reveal Heaven’s secrets.\n\nNow I reveal its hidden intent,\nThis passage as its seal.\n\nFire’s efficacy lies only in this:\nDispersed, it becomes *qi*;\nConcentrated, it becomes fire;\nTransformed, it becomes water;\nAltered, it becomes gold.\n\nCondense this *qi*—\nTrue essence unscattered—\nAnd the fire’s timing lies within!\n\nThus it is said:\nFire has its timing, yet needs no hour—\nA whisper of mechanism I alone know.\nWhen the *qi* first returns at the new moon’s start,\nAdjusting advance and retreat—\nLet no delay linger.\n\nSomeone asks: How gather the herbs?\nHow refine the fire’s alchemy?\nI reply:\nHerbs bear the Mysterious Opening’s life,\nFire ignites the Yang Furnace’s glow.\nAdjusting advance and retreat—\nAll depends on me.\nWhen the *qi* first returns, the Transformation’s pivot is set.\n\n**Sixth Section:** Master Yangzi said:\nThe Divine Furnace, the Elixir Cavern,\nThe Jade Chamber, the Golden Room—\nThese are but names for the alchemical vessel.\n\nThe Yellow Court, the Yellow Dao,\nThe Yellow Chamber, the Yellow Matron,\nThe Wu-Ji Bright Hall—\nThese are but names for the Central Palace.\n\nTrue Yang is *Qian*—Heaven, Father, Husband.\nThe Yang Soul is the Azure Dragon,\nThe Lord of Wood, the Mercury of the Male.\nYang within Yin, the Sulfur within the Mercury,\nThe Cinnabar Father’s essence, the Wooden Fluid—\nThese are but names for the Infant Brother.\n\nTrue Yin is *Kun*—Earth, Mother, Wife.\nThe Yin Spirit is the White Tiger,\nThe Female Lead, the Silver within the Lead.\nYin within Yang, the Mother’s Blood, the Golden Essence—\nThese are but names for the Astonished Maiden.\n\nThough names abound, their principle is one.\n\nLead, neither too distant nor too near,\nMust meet the Yang Mercury’s aid.\nWhen it encounters True Earth, it becomes\nThe Great Elixir’s gold.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\nFirst, take *Qian* and *Kun* as the vessel,\nThen drive the Black Hare’s elixir to boil.\nOnce the Two Creatures return to the Yellow Dao,\nHow could the Soul Elixir fail to manifest?\nThis is but one path of the Dao.\n\nThe common man scatters one into myriad,\nYet the sage gathers myriad into one—\nThus it is said: *My Dao is one, through which all is threaded.*\n\nDescend to the One—\nAnd the One gives birth to water,\nMy body’s North Dipper.\n\nThe Dipper arises from the One,\nThe One is the root of life—\nMy inherent nature,\nThe meaning of the Three-One Command.\n\nThe world’s utmost precision\nThus becomes spirit.\nSpirit reaches its peak—\nYet spirit’s virtue never leaves the One.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*He who does not depart from precision is called the Spiritual Man.*\n\nThe One is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nWith root, life emerges;\nWith life, flourishing follows.\nIf the root is not deepened,\nThe stem not secured—\nHow then grasp *Hugging the One*?\n\nFrom rising to repose, I think of the One.\nIn eating and drinking, I think of the One.\nNever let the thought cease—\nFor the Great Mysterious One is the Northern Heaven’s *Qi*,\nThe *Qi* of the *Kan* Palace’s Rectification,\nThe Dao’s origin.\n\nThe One—\nThe Original One, the Great One,\nThe Mysterious One, the Founding One—\nThis *Qi* governs Heaven and Earth’s essence,\nCrowns the primacy of Yin and Yang,\nIs the root of the Two Luminaries,\nThe ancestor of all things.\n\nIt accumulates the chaos of Yin and Yang,\nIts *qi* and essence turning from the *Kan* Palace to the *Dui* direction,\nCalled the Yang within Yin.\n\nWithout Yang in water,\nHow could it bear all things?\n\nThe True Seeker—\nIf he knows this Mysterious Heaven’s *Qi*\nAnd begins his work from here,\nSwiftly he will verify truth and attain the Way.\n\nNow let us examine the North Dipper’s seven stars:\nStars are born from the Sun.\nThe Dipper arises from *Kan*,\nInheriting the Sun’s essence.\n\nThe Sun’s essence, born from the One,\n*Kan* as a hexagram—\nThe Sun and Moon dwell within it!\n\nThough *Li* is the Sun,\nAnd *Kan* the Moon,\nThis is their division:\n*Li* contains five numbers,\n*Kan* contains five numbers—\nTogether, *Kan* and *Li* make ten.\n\nHeaven One, Earth Six,\nAnd *Kan* holds them both—\nThus it encompasses the Sun and Moon’s functions.\n\nMen say the Dipper is northern,\nBut no—it is born from *Kan*,\nThus called the North Dipper.\nIt moves through the center,\nThus called the Central Dipper.\n\nThe song says:\n*The Nine Elements reside in *Kan* at the Pole’s center,\nAll luminaries guard and transform.\nThe True Person freely returns to the Dipper’s handle,\nIts shadow follows the Moon’s monthly course.*\n\n*Kan* is truly the root of life,\n*Li* the void of nature.\n\nAs the *Taishang* says in the *True Scriptures of the South and North Dippers*,\nIt first speaks of the North, then the South.\n\nNorth is Heaven One,\nSouth is Earth Two.\n*Kan* is the Mysterious,\n*Li* is the Vermilion.\nVermilion is fire,\nMysterious is water—\nWater births fire,\nPrecision births *qi*.\nTo speak of the North without the South is impossible.\nNorth and South unite,\n*Kan* and *Li* intertwine—\nPreserve the essence to enter spirit,\nThe marvel of their mutual use.\n\nWithout spirit and essence,\nHow could this be life’s command?\n\nLife’s command within life—\nBefore parents conceived the embryo,\nThere was no root of life.\n\nLife’s command within life—\nLife lies in the Mysterious Origin,\nThe Mysterious Origin being the Dao’s *qi*.\n\nWithin the Mysterious, there is Mysterious—\nThis is my life.\nWithin life, there is life—\nThis is my form.\n\nWhen essence, *qi*, and spirit are whole,\nThe body does not decay,\nForm and life endure eternally,\nIn harmony with nature,\nAs long as Heaven and Earth.\n\nMan’s birth—\nLife is his root.\nIf life does not descend from Heaven,\nThe Dao cannot give birth.\n\nIts day is natural,\nFixed by nature itself—\nLike the command descending, received below.\n\nFor when the *qi* of the Nine Heavens descends,\nOnly then does the embryo form.\nIf the Nine Heaven’s Marshal does not issue the decree,\nMan cannot be born.\n\nPreserve the form, guard the spirit,\nCherish the *qi*, secure the root—\nThus death and decay are never known,\nAnd the immortal’s way is attained.\n\nThe precious indeed!\n\nThe Classics say:\n*\"I do not see nor hear—\nI do not know of the spirit,\nNor does the spirit depart from me,\nThus enduring with the Dao as long as ages.\"*\n\nThen it speaks of *\"my life is within me,\nNot confined by Creation and Transformation.\"*[*]\n\nThe *Sutras of the Seven Primordials* say:\n*\"The Great Sovereign instructed the Seven Primordials:\n'The Lower Primordial generates man,\nFrom the *qi* of the *Yīnyūn* Primordial Unity,\nThe essence of the Primordial forming,\nEndowed with life, one form complete.\n\nThe Three Primordials nurture,\nThe Nine *Qi* cover and protect.\nThus, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper—\nEvery man possesses them fully.\n\nThe first nine stars, the *Potent Dragon* hidden,\nEstablish the *zi* position—\nThe Primordial Marshal of the Northern Dipper resides there!\n\nKnowing this Primordial Spirit,\nCultivating its refinement and nourishment,\nWhen form and spirit merge in unity,\nThe true essence manifests externally,\nAnd the Mysterious Function is fulfilled.'*\n\nThe song declares:\n*\"Without stars, none bow to Heaven’s Enclosure—\nOnly the true mechanism lies in the dim and distant.\"*\n\nThus, the *Chénjī* (Polaris) is the *heart of Heaven*,\nWith rectitude as its square—\nFacing the peak of *Kūnlún*,\nLocated in the *Purple Palace* of the Northern Pole, *Zhàngdōng*.\n\nAt the center of Heaven,\nWithin the Four Auxiliaries,\nBeneath the *Huágài* (Celestial Canopy),\nIt is the *heart of Heaven*.\n\nStill and unchanging—\nIt is the Master of the Primordial *Qi*,\nThe pivot and axis of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe song declares:\n*\"The true Yang encloses the *qi* in ceaseless motion,\nAscending and descending through the Three Palaces in secret,\nLife and death do not concern the floating world’s affairs—\nTogether they lead the Five Elders to the Golden Platform.\"*\n\nThe Five Elders are the spirits of the Five *Zàng* (Viscera),\nEach man has them naturally—\nThe twelve nodes, the thirty-six minute bones,\nEach pore aligned, each pulse connected,\nEach node linked.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches its peak,\nThen *golden sinews and jade bones*,\nThe hundred limbs uncorrupted,\nThe pure *qi* ascends to become Heaven—\nPure yet purer, spirit yet more spirit,\nYang yet more Yang.\n\nMan receives the Primordial *Qi* of Heaven and is born,\nFrom the Three Pure Ones dividing their Three *Qi* into the Three Primordials—\nThe Upper *Dān Tiān* (Elixir Field) *Ní Wán Fǔ* (Mud Pellet Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Jade Purity* Green *Qi*;\nThe Middle *Dān Tiān* *Jiàng Gōng Fǔ* (Vermilion Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Upper Purity* White *Qi*;\nThe Lower *Dān Tiān* *Jiāo Huì Fǔ* (Convergence Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Supreme Purity* Yellow *Qi*.\n\nThis is what was spoken of earlier—\n*\"Preserving essence to enter the spirit.\"*\n\nThe *Supreme Purity* true soil,\nNot the thick, heavy, and turbid earth of the world—\nThe transforming origin of all things.\n\nHeaven unifies the Three Palaces as one,\nEnduring through ten thousand ages without flaw.\nThe Three Palaces ascend and descend,\nAscending and descending without end—\nThis is what is meant!\n\nTo know one’s own Three Pure Ones—\nWhy seek above?\nTo know one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*—\nWhy search externally?\n\nThe *Supreme Sage* says:\n*\"Essence is my spirit,\n*Qi* is my Dao.\nPreserve essence and nurture *qi*,\nGuard and uphold firm rectitude.\n\nWhen Yin and Yang unite,\nThe true form is established—\nAnd the transformation generates the Boy Child.\nTest the breath at the nostrils—\nIt does not reach the ears.\nSpeak with the mouth—\nIt does not shake the lungs.\nThen the elixir vein forms itself.\"*\n\n*Qi* transforms into essence,\nEssence transforms into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into the Boy Child of the Heart.\n\nWithin my body reside the thirty-six thousand spirits,\nEver attending at my side.\n\nIf this is maintained over time,\nThen one’s own Three Pure Ones, one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*, will appear!\n\nGreat are the mysteries of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars!\nThe Seven Stars’ true names and forms—\nThey are the Seven *Qi* of the Primordial Beginning,\nAlso the true *Qi* of the seven orifices within the human body.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Dipper Stars traverse the twelve *Zhī* (Earthly Branches) above,\nThe *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* (Child-Midday-Male Ox-Western Maid) palaces—\nWithin them lies the path to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred!\n\nThus, the fourth star *Wén Qū* (Literature Weaver),\nIs the gate of Yin-Yang convergence—\nThe *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* positions where man is born.\nThe *ào-mǎo* (Male Ox-Western Maid) convergence occurs here,\nAnd moreover, within Yin there is Yang,\nWithin Yang there is Yin—\nThis is called the *Two-Eight* Gate.\n\nThe *Dān* (Alchemy) Classics say:\n*\"The Dragon moves through the sixteen gates,\nThe Tiger hides in the nine and three doors—\nWithin the Heavenly Pass,\nIts path is the Mysterious Extremity.\"*\n\nMan can understand the mutual use of Yin and Yang,\nThe interplay of *Wū-Tù* (Heavenly Hare),\nThus the Dao’s *Qi* increases,\nAnd the elixir spirit is accomplished.\n\nThe *Huáng Tíng* (Yellow Court) Classics say:\n*\"Within the Three Passes, essence, *Qi*, and spirit reside,\nWithin the Nine Profound, profound yet more profound.\nThe mouth is the Heavenly Pass—spirit’s mechanism,\nThe hands are the Human Pass—holding the flourishing and decline,\nThe feet are the Earthly Pass—life’s threshold.\nAnd within the Dipper, the Three Passes are possessed—\nThe Heavenly Pass is at *wǔ*,\nThe Human Pass is at *ào-mǎo*,\nThe Earthly Pass is at *zi-wǔ*.\nThe Yin-Yang boundary positions,\nThe *ào-mǎo* doors where sun and moon enter and exit.\"*\n\nReflect now!\nThe Mysterious is the origin of all things,\nIts principle inherent.\n\nThe hidden Mysterious of things,\nNot as hidden as the Mysterious within the human body—\nThe Mysterious within the human body,\nIs the Heavenly Mechanism,\nThe Mysterious Function.\n\nThus the *Yīn Fú* (Dark Seal) Classics say:\n*\"The sacred function is born from it,\nThe spirit and light emerge from it!\"*\n\nIt is known:\nThe Mysterious is the origin of *Qi*,\nThe true of the Dao,\nHeaven’s hue,\nThe marvel of the Law,\nThe profundity of principle,\nWater’s source.\n\nIf one exhausts its principle,\nMust construct its Mysterious,\nFulfill its nature,\nThen reaching to its life.\n\nConsider the beginning when *Hún Dùn* (Chaos) was undivided—\nWhere were the years, months, days, and hours?\n\nSpirit is nature, *Qi* is life—\nSpirit does not stray externally, *Qi* regulates itself.\n\nThe work is complete!\nThe seventh.\n\nHuì-Yáng Zǐ said:\nThe Golden Elixir’s great medicine,\nIndeed lies in what the Master transmits,\nYet also in Heaven’s favor.\n\nOur Daoist Ancestor, the Most High Laozi,\nIn the *Dàodé Jīng* says:\n*\"Heaven’s Way has no favorites,\nIt always aids the virtuous.\"*\n\nOur Ancestor, Master Wèi Bóyáng,\nIn the *Cāntóng Qì* says:\n*\"Heaven’s Way has no fixed path,\nIt is transmitted only to the worthy.\"*\n\nOur Ancestor, Pure Yang True Person,\nIn the *Qìn Yuán Chūn* says:\n*\"The path of the humble gourd,\nWith three thousand deeds fulfilled,\nAlone strides back to the clouds.\"*\n\nOur Ancestor, Master Zhāng,\nIn his poem says:\n*\"The Great Medicine’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,\nI know it depends on me and on Heaven—\nIf not for accumulated merit and hidden virtue,\nEvery move invites demons to obstruct.\"*\n\nAgain, in the *Xī Jiāng Yuè*:\n*\"If virtue surpasses eight hundred,\nAnd hidden deeds reach three thousand,\nBalancing all beings, kin, and grudges,\nOnly then does one fulfill the true wish of the Immortals.\"*\n\nIndeed, the completion of the Golden Elixir\nIs Heaven’s reward for the greatly virtuous.\nIf one does not cultivate hidden virtue\nBut merely seeks to steal the Great Dao,\nThen Heaven will not aid them.\nEven if they begin the practice,\nDemons will soon arise to obstruct,\nOr for years they toil in vain,\nOnly to blame the Dao or the Master,\nAnd thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nBut if there are those who truly seek the Dao,\nEver mindful, compassionate, and aiding beings,\nRescuing the poor, relieving suffering,\nCherishing life, saving all sentient beings,\nEncouraging loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness,\nAnd performing all manner of hidden virtues—\nSuch as truly sparing life,\nOr practicing skillful means to abstain from killing—\nThen the Immortals will recommend them,\nThe Celestial Sovereign will bestow blessings.\nThey will swiftly find a clear Master,\nReceive true transmission,\nBegin cultivation with swift results,\nHeaven aiding them, all spirits protecting,\nNo demonic obstructions, every action aligning with the True Principle.\nIn due time, the work will be complete,\nLiving in the world, eternally transcendent,\nAscending to the clouds,\nForm and spirit both perfected,\nFree and unbound.\nMoreover, their blessings extend to descendants,\nEnduring under the Dao’s shelter—\nThis, though the Master’s grace,\nIs truly Heaven’s gift.\n\nTwenty years of seeking the Dao,\nTraversing ten thousand rivers and mountains,\nNo clear Master found—how could one rest?\nHow many times did I raise a single incense stick in prayer?\n\nFortunate to meet the Perfect One,\nWho revealed the wondrous use of the Void,\nThe work accomplished in an instant,\nDivine light radiant throughout the body.\n\n---\n*Xī Jiāng Yuè*\nFrom death’s embrace, reborn again,\nReturning to recognize the true self—\nThis journey’s boat, though bound for the coffin,\nNo eight winds can shake it.\n\nA midnight moon wheel,\nThe Supreme Ultimate Diagram,\nTen thousand *lǐ* of clear azure,\nGreen peaks dissolving into clouds.\n\nJoy supreme, joy supreme,\nCommon folk say it’s hard to find—\nWhen asked what I do,\nSilence is the Great Return.\n\n---\n*Jīn Dān Hé Cháo Hòu Tú*\n*\"Chisel open Chaos to reveal the Qiantang River,\nThe southern sky’s Yangtze as a silver screen—\nPoets past and present have painted this scene,\nYet who can truly trace its origin?\"*\n\nYears pass, years return,\nDays of *Gēng*, months of *Jiǎ*—\nWhy this sudden chaos?\nNow it is revealed:\nTo know Heaven and Earth’s true source.\n\nThe Dao disperses, yet one name prevails—\nThe Five Phases in reverse,\nMutually arrayed in Heaven and Earth’s cycles.\n\nThe *Kǎn* Water flows backward toward the *Bǐng* Gate,\nFollowing the waxing and waning of the moon,\nQi peaking at the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nGold can generate Water,\nDoubly surging like a thousand layers of snow—\nThe Immortals’ wondrous use\nDiffers not from the tides.\n\nThis ode to the *Jiāngyuè* Moon,\nSilently aligning with the Heavenly Cycle’s numbers,\nThus the Tidal Chart is recorded here,\nTo show those of shared intent.\n\n---\n**Tidal Chart**\n\nDay 1 / 16 – *Wǔ Mò* – **Great** – Night *Zǐ Zhèng*\nDay 2 / 17 – *Wèi Chū* – **Great** – Night *Zǐ Mò*\nDay 3 / 18 – *Wèi

      "translated_text": "**Essentials of Longevity**\nNarrated by **Huíyáng Zǐ** Lin Zìrán\n**Chapter One**\n\nI have heard that the **Primordial Dao** lies within the **Hun-tun**—unfathomable by perception, ungraspable by cognition. Listen with the ears and hear with the eyes; see with the eyes and perceive with the ears. Vague and indistinct, dim and obscure, neither form nor image, yet named as **Dao**. The subtlety of the Dao being beyond measure, one must only gaze upward and downward to comprehend it. When aligned with the human body, it fits like matching seals.\n\nHaving attained the **mystery within the mystery**, the **subtlety within the subtlety**, I dare not keep it entirely concealed. Thus, from the realm of **Being and Non-Being**, I reveal its roots. The **Receptive (Yīn)** is the undivided black of **Hun-tun**, like the stem of a gourd, containing the true essence. The **black qi** permeates, blending with **Creation**,—is this not the marvel of **Taiyi** embracing the true **qi**?\n\nOnce the **Two Principles (Yīn-Yáng)** are distinguished, the **Four Symbols** emerge, and from them, the **Five Phases** manifest. Then the **Eight Trigrams** are arranged, with the **central palace** as their origin. The central palace is the domain of **Earth**. Thus, water finds stability in Earth, fire finds rest, metal finds life, and wood flourishes—like a child in its mother’s womb, nourished by the **primordial black qi** of Heaven and Earth, aligned with the central palace, breathing in unison. Once the embryo forms and the umbilical cord is severed, the received **true black qi** of Heaven and Earth, infused with the **Divine Sovereign’s spirit-qi**, merges with the primordial harmony, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, sharing in their transformation.\n\nYet when **emotions and desires** stir within and without, when **pleasures and attachments** arise, the **qi** separates from the true, the **original spirit** follows external allurements. Though it mingles with the **true qi** of Heaven and Earth, without a foundation for **transformation**, it is instead seized by them, causing the body to decay and the **qi** to fade—thus, death becomes inevitable.\n\nThis **qi** is the **Primordial Chaos’s ancestral breath**, the **source of immortal life and fate**. To possess it is to live; to lose it is to die. Those who attain it **plunder Heaven and Earth’s creation**; those who fail are **plundered by them**—what is lost is the **single point of original yang-qi**.\n\nPractitioners of cultivation, why not return to the **Root** and refine according to the seasons, forging the **Great Elixir**? The method of refinement is simple: inhale when the **Mother** exhales, exhale when the **Mother** inhales. Each inhalation draws **Heaven’s qi** downward; each exhalation raises **Earth’s qi** upward. Breathing follows its natural rhythm, not blindly forced—stir one spirit, and all spirits move; open one orifice, and all orifices open.\n\nSeekers of the Dao must trace its source, as if still within the **mother’s womb**, embracing the **Primordial**, guarding the **One**. **Taiyi** contains the true **qi**; Heaven and Earth nurture the **Yellow Sprout**. The **Yellow Sprout** is the **mother of Lead**—those who fail to cultivate see their **qi** severed, their life extinguished, unable to **reclaim the lost light** and reflect inward, fixated only on the external.\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **essence of Heaven and Earth** gathers in the **sun and moon**; the **essence of humanity** resides in the **eyes**. When a person takes form, the **kidneys** emerge first, corresponding to the **Wheel of Essence** within. Then the **eyes** form, like water droplets, mirroring Heaven and Earth in their purity. Before Heaven and Earth divided, before the **Two Luminaires** shone, all was **Hun-tun**, dim and obscure. When the **Two Principles** separated, the **Two Luminaires** illuminated, **water and fire** emerged, and all things were born—thus arises the marvel of **transformation**.\n\nTo cultivate, one must extract the **Primordial qi** beneath the **horizontal eyes**, seeking the **Heavenly-Earthly essence** and applying it. If this subtlety is mastered, it is called **soaring beyond sun and moon**, piercing the **Kunlun peaks**. Ancestors of the Dao taught no other path.\n\nThe **Yellow Court** is the **furnace and cauldron** where sacred deeds are forged, where **divinity** is born. **Pure above, turbid below**, the path connects the **Eight Waters**, ascending to the **Sea of Marrow**, regulating the **Five Qi**, blending the **Hundred Spirits**, descending to the **Gushing Spring**, cycling endlessly day and night. The **true essence of Heaven and Earth**, along with the **spirit without form**, may be united here. When the **ten months** of cultivation are complete, the **embryo is born**—smallly, it grants longevity and joy; greatly, it transcends humanity to sainthood. Wandering in transformation, unbound in Heaven and Earth, when virtue is complete, one ascends to the **Jade Emptiness Above**. Such alchemy is profound and wondrous—how can cultivators of the **Elixir** not devote themselves to the **Dao**?\n\n**Chapter Two**\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **Dao** and **Nature** are one continuous principle. Heaven, possessing **qi**, covers all below; Earth, possessing **substance**, supports all above. Between them lies **eighty-four thousand li**. **Qi** and **substance** cannot naturally intermingle—Heaven, through **Kàn**, reaches into **Kùn**, returning to Earth, its **yang** bearing **yīn** upward; Earth, through **Kùn**, reaches into **Kàn**, returning to Heaven, its **yīn** embracing **yang** downward. In this endless rise and fall, they never stray from the **Dao**, thus enduring forever. There is no other reason.\n\nMoreover, the **Nature of Heaven and Earth** is humanity’s most noble inheritance.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Two (continued)**\n\nThe **Heart** compares to Heaven and bears the name **Vermilion Bird**, manifesting in the eyes as **red veins**; the **Kidneys** compare to Earth and bear the name **Dark Warrior**, affecting the eyes with **essence-qi**. The **Liver**, as the **yang** position, is likened to the **Green Dragon**, its essence appearing green in the eyes; the **Lungs**, as the **yin** position, are likened to the **White Tiger**, their essence appearing white when seen.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s transformative forces converge entirely in the eyes. If one harmonizes them with clarity, the source of transformation is revealed—probing the **Kàn-Lì** phases, aligning with the dynamic rhythms of **symbols and correspondences**, day and night. With focused spirit and forgotten schemes, preserving light and embracing brightness, how could one fail to unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth?\n\nYet, from the moment humans separate from their parents, they are stained by the **six dusts**, their **Heavenly Five Qi** scattered and stripped away, their senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue—entangled by sounds and colors. Thoughts stray from their proper place; external openness leads to inner dimness. When obstructed by the **Yellow Center**, the body fractures, its completeness lost to a single crooked path. Turning away from the root to chase the superficial, they forget to return, and the **Dao-heart** is veiled, hidden and unseen!\n\nHow could they then unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth? Not only do they fail to unite, but they further corrupt it with change—until the **Original Yang** is depleted, the **True Qi** lost, all because external things blind the eyes, and **essence** floats above **nature**, daily expending its light outward.\n\nAlas! Why do those who study the **Dao** not awaken the depths of the *Yì* and reflect upon this?\n\nMoreover, when **Kùn’s** proper position enters **Kàn’s** proper position, adding two strokes within, it becomes **Kàn**—for **Kàn-water** is internally luminous. If one penetrates the luminous nature of water, clarity flows unimpeded; if one clings to the luminous nature of fire, darkness multiplies. For above and below are both **yang** strokes, only red remains—yet when **Yellow** resides centrally, light emerges. Thus, **Lì-fire** is red from beginning to end, but excessive redness turns black.\n\nWhat reliance can one place in this within humanity?",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, those who cling to the external luminosity—this is the principle of the *Yì*’s light illuminating the Western River. Those who do not return to its source—this is the meaning of the separation between gold and wood.\n\nOnly the enlightened ones, when encountering each and every realm, follow their perception and restore it, thereby seizing its luminosity and returning to its essence, thus preserving the **virtue/power** of **Kùn**. When one preserves their **virtue/power**, their **nature** does not stray; when **nature** does not stray, the **spirit** does not wander; when the **spirit** does not wander, the **essence** does not disperse; when the **essence** does not disperse, the **True Qi** gathers. When **True Qi** gathers, the **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem; when **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem, the myriad **spirits** align with the **Primordial Origin**. The three flowers converge at the crown, maintaining the **Great Harmony**, and one attains immediate transcendence, achieving the radiance of the **Nine Tripod Elixir**, piercing the **Void Realm**, and aligning with the **Pure and Clear** in its transformation. Only then does one reside before the **Great Primordial Chaos** of **Tàichū**.\n\nIf not so, even at the moment of blinking, distinctions between self and others arise!\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **Dao**’s natural course completes the twelve **Earthly Branches** and **Celestial Stems**, totaling ninety-six **kè** (moments). It encompasses all of heaven and earth, yet penetrates the finest hairs of autumn. The common folk, unaware, mistakenly insert four **kè** into the **Zǐ-wu-xǐ-yǒu** (Child-Midday-Mao-Western) cycle—this is all incorrect. Heaven and earth’s creation cannot be increased or diminished; to increase is to prolong, to diminish is to shorten. Heaven has ten **gān** (Celestial Stems), which are **yang** numbers, the root; earth has twelve **zhī** (Earthly Branches), which are **coupled** numbers, the end. The common folk follow the **Branches**, while sages follow the **Stems**; the remaining **kè** lie within them!\n\n**Lǎozǐ** said: *\"When the root descends and the end flows, the myriad things are born.\"* The root delves into the foundation and secures the origin; the end blooms and bears fruit. When the melon ripens, the stem detaches—its fragrance arises naturally. Only those who split the melon truly know its flavor.\n\nTo know: those who study the **Dao** must cultivate **spirit** and **Qi** fully. It is unnecessary to be bound by years, months, days, or **shí-chén** (times). This is the principle of *\"form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the **Dao** in truth.\"* Further, to delve into **nature**’s ultimate essence and ascend a step higher, one must attain **nature** and **life** as an indivisible whole, unrestricted in coming and going.\n\nAfter achieving **True Stillness**, a point of luminous **spirit** pierces the **Jade Pool**—this is the **Mysterious Feminine**. Before heaven and earth were differentiated, they were like a chicken egg, hence the **Primordial Origin** is contained within the **Great Primordial Origin**. Before **Huntingian Chaos** was resolved, heaven and earth first divided: the **Primordial** is the substance, the **Post-Primordial** is the function. The light and clear ascend as heaven, the heavy and turbid descend as earth; the center is the human body—this is the **Three Talents**, the fixed source of all things.\n\nInternally, the **Mysterious Feminine** is the root of heaven and earth; externally, it is the gateway of birth and death. Piercing the **Great Primordial Chaos**’s aperture, surging through the **Upper Vertex Pass**, boundless **immortals** emerge from here, and the myriad ages rank among the **Celestial Assembly**.\n\nThe teacher **Xiè** reveals the root and source: one escapes the cycle of **rebirth** and **samsara** externally, dwelling in mountains or cities with ease, hidden or revealed without obstruction in coming and going.\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: *\"From having arises non-having; from non-having arises having; from non-having emerges having; from having emerges non-having.\"* Thus, the *Xiāozāi Jīng* (Scripture of Eliminating Calamities) states: *\"Having having and non-having having, the end is ever dark and unclear, unable to self-illuminate.\"* Yet those who illuminate the mind and perceive **nature** differ from this—when non-having is non-having and having is having, it diverges from this.\n\nTherefore, **Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** (the **Purple Yang Sage**) said: *\"**True Stillness** floats and sinks, distinguishing guest and host.\"* The root is **nature** as host, and first, **life** is established. The verse says: *\"Though he be the guest, I am the host.\"* This is precisely the **floating and sinking of nature and life**.\n\nFor instance, the sun rises from the **Eastern Sea**, its auspicious **Qi** filling the sky, its rosy radiance dazzling. A hundred paces from the sea gate, its light begins to fade. As it nears its setting in the west, its radiance is reclaimed, returning to its origin—so too is this.\n\nThose who study the **Dao** must understand this principle: scattering the **spirit**’s light, one pursues the myriad things. The common folk’s actions are thus, while sages follow perception and restore it, like the sun returning to its origin.\n\n**Cuī Gōng**’s entry into the **Medicine Mirror** is this very principle! Hence it is said: *\"The creation of heaven and earth is all gathered in the sun and moon; the creation of humanity is all gathered in the **Primordial Origin**.\"* Is this not the boundless transformation, enduring as long as heaven and earth?\n\n**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **sage’s embryo** matures in ten months, and the infant manifests. Those who study the **Dao** are like a person building a house: first, one must lay the foundation solidly before it can bear weight. Awaiting the birth of **heaven and earth’s single yang**, one takes the month from the year, the day from the month, the **shí-chén** from the day, and the **kè** from the **shí-chén**. When ten months complete the embryo’s circle, the work is fulfilled, and **virtue/power** is attained—just as the common folk, after a thousand days, finally separate from their mother’s milk, gaining autonomy. When **yin** and **yang** meet, the self’s body arises from their union—not sought externally. *\"Coming, clouds fill the thousand mountains; departing, the moon spans the ten thousand waters.\"*\n\nThose who study the **Dao** possess their own **sage father** and **sage mother**, their own **self-born father and mother**. I awaken to seven parts, the teacher refines three parts; I awaken to three parts, the teacher refines seven parts—totaling ten parts. One must awaken and perceive themselves to enter the **Dao**. According to one’s capacity, one accommodates others and bears fruit; the **wooden method** lies entirely in **cultivating the soil**.\n\nI see the world’s people, ever turning in confusion, failing to comprehend the sages’ classics. Once the human body is lost, they face countless kalpas to regain it. Is this not painful?\n\nThe **sea of suffering** is boundless—turning back is the path to liberation. It is not my intention now to speak bitterly in vain; I fear only that you may waste precious time. Instead, take it upon yourself to instantly awaken, transcend the mundane, and attain sainthood.\n\n**Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** said: *\"When a nation is wealthy and its people at peace, it seeks war; only after war does it see true tranquility.\"* A wealthy nation brings peace to its people; peaceful people enrich their nation. So too, when a person’s **Primordial Spirit**, **Primordial Darkness**, and **Primordial Essence** return to their proper abodes—the **spirit** to the **spirit chamber**, the **essence** to the **essence palace**, and the **Qi** to its **root**—if these three can return to their origins, then the nation is wealthy and its people at peace.\n\nFurther, if one penetrates this profound principle, it becomes the **Three Families Meeting** to form the **embryo of the sage**’s union. When two things meet, their **emotions** and **nature** merge. The **Tiger** and **Dragon** coil together at the center—this is the **soil**. **Wù** is **yang soil**, capable of generating the myriad things; **Jǐ** is **yin soil**, capable of nourishing the myriad things. Thus, the myriad things are born and grow—humanity is likewise.»",

Thus, **Lì-fire** is red from beginning to end, but excessive redness turns black.\n\nWhat reliance can one place in this within humanity?",

said:\nThe ancient sages transmitted the Great Elixir’s gold,\nYet withheld the fire’s timing—\nNot to reveal Heaven’s secrets.\n\nNow I reveal its hidden intent,\nThis passage as its seal.\n\nFire’s efficacy lies only in this:\nDispersed, it becomes *qi*;\nConcentrated, it becomes fire;\nTransformed, it becomes water;\nAltered, it becomes gold.\n\nCondense this *qi*—\nTrue essence unscattered—\nAnd the fire’s timing lies within!\n\nThus it is said:\nFire has its timing, yet needs no hour—\nA whisper of mechanism I alone know.\nWhen the *qi* first returns at the new moon’s start,\nAdjusting advance and retreat—\nLet no delay linger.\n\nSomeone asks: How gather the herbs?\nHow refine the fire’s alchemy?\nI reply:\nHerbs bear the Mysterious Opening’s life,\nFire ignites the Yang Furnace’s glow.\nAdjusting advance and retreat—\nAll depends on me.\nWhen the *qi* first returns, the Transformation’s pivot is set.\n\n**Sixth Section:** Master Yangzi said:\nThe Divine Furnace, the Elixir Cavern,\nThe Jade Chamber, the Golden Room—\nThese are but names for the alchemical vessel.\n\nThe Yellow Court, the Yellow Dao,\nThe Yellow Chamber, the Yellow Matron,\nThe Wu-Ji Bright Hall—\nThese are but names for the Central Palace.\n\nTrue Yang is *Qian*—Heaven, Father, Husband.\nThe Yang Soul is the Azure Dragon,\nThe Lord of Wood, the Mercury of the Male.\nYang within Yin, the Sulfur within the Mercury,\nThe Cinnabar Father’s essence, the Wooden Fluid—\nThese are but names for the Infant Brother.\n\nTrue Yin is *Kun*—Earth, Mother, Wife.\nThe Yin Spirit is the White Tiger,\nThe Female Lead, the Silver within the Lead.\nYin within Yang, the Mother’s Blood, the Golden Essence—\nThese are but names for the Astonished Maiden.\n\nThough names abound, their principle is one.\n\nLead, neither too distant nor too near,\nMust meet the Yang Mercury’s aid.\nWhen it encounters True Earth, it becomes\nThe Great Elixir’s gold.\n\nMaster Ziyang said:\nFirst, take *Qian* and *Kun* as the vessel,\nThen drive the Black Hare’s elixir to boil.\nOnce the Two Creatures return to the Yellow Dao,\nHow could the Soul Elixir fail to manifest?\nThis is but one path of the Dao.\n\nThe common man scatters one into myriad,\nYet the sage gathers myriad into one—\nThus it is said: *My Dao is one, through which all is threaded.*\n\nDescend to the One—\nAnd the One gives birth to water,\nMy body’s North Dipper.\n\nThe Dipper arises from the One,\nThe One is the root of life—\nMy inherent nature,\nThe meaning of the Three-One Command.\n\nThe world’s utmost precision\nThus becomes spirit.\nSpirit reaches its peak—\nYet spirit’s virtue never leaves the One.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*He who does not depart from precision is called the Spiritual Man.*\n\nThe One is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nWith root, life emerges;\nWith life, flourishing follows.\nIf the root is not deepened,\nThe stem not secured—\nHow then grasp *Hugging the One*?\n\nFrom rising to repose, I think of the One.\nIn eating and drinking, I think of the One.\nNever let the thought cease—\nFor the Great Mysterious One is the Northern Heaven’s *Qi*,\nThe *Qi* of the *Kan* Palace’s Rectification,\nThe Dao’s origin.\n\nThe One—\nThe Original One, the Great One,\nThe Mysterious One, the Founding One—\nThis *Qi* governs Heaven and Earth’s essence,\nCrowns the primacy of Yin and Yang,\nIs the root of the Two Luminaries,\nThe ancestor of all things.\n\nIt accumulates the chaos of Yin and Yang,\nIts *qi* and essence turning from the *Kan* Palace to the *Dui* direction,\nCalled the Yang within Yin.\n\nWithout Yang in water,\nHow could it bear all things?\n\nThe True Seeker—\nIf he knows this Mysterious Heaven’s *Qi*\nAnd begins his work from here,\nSwiftly he will verify truth and attain the Way.\n\nNow let us examine the North Dipper’s seven stars:\nStars are born from the Sun.\nThe Dipper arises from *Kan*,\nInheriting the Sun’s essence.\n\nThe Sun’s essence, born from the One,\n*Kan* as a hexagram—\nThe Sun and Moon dwell within it!\n\nThough *Li* is the Sun,\nAnd *Kan* the Moon,\nThis is their division:\n*Li* contains five numbers,\n*Kan* contains five numbers—\nTogether, *Kan* and *Li* make ten.\n\nHeaven One, Earth Six,\nAnd *Kan* holds them both—\nThus it encompasses the Sun and Moon’s functions.\n\nMen say the Dipper is northern,\nBut no—it is born from *Kan*,\nThus called the North Dipper.\nIt moves through the center,\nThus called the Central Dipper.\n\nThe song says:\n*The Nine Elements reside in *Kan* at the Pole’s center,\nAll luminaries guard and transform.\nThe True Person freely returns to the Dipper’s handle,\nIts shadow follows the Moon’s monthly course.*\n\n*Kan* is truly the root of life,\n*Li* the void of nature.\n\nAs the *Taishang* says in the *True Scriptures of the South and North Dippers*,\nIt first speaks of the North, then the South.\n\nNorth is Heaven One,\nSouth is Earth Two.\n*Kan* is the Mysterious,\n*Li* is the Vermilion.\nVermilion is fire,\nMysterious is water—\nWater births fire,\nPrecision births *qi*.\nTo speak of the North without the South is impossible.\nNorth and South unite,\n*Kan* and *Li* intertwine—\nPreserve the essence to enter spirit,\nThe marvel of their mutual use.\n\nWithout spirit and essence,\nHow could this be life’s command?\n\nLife’s command within life—\nBefore parents conceived the embryo,\nThere was no root of life.\n\nLife’s command within life—\nLife lies in the Mysterious Origin,\nThe Mysterious Origin being the Dao’s *qi*.\n\nWithin the Mysterious, there is Mysterious—\nThis is my life.\nWithin life, there is life—\nThis is my form.\n\nWhen essence, *qi*, and spirit are whole,\nThe body does not

the *zi* position—\nThe Primordial Marshal of the Northern Dipper resides there!\n\nKnowing this Primordial Spirit,\nCultivating its refinement and nourishment,\nWhen form and spirit merge in unity,\nThe true essence manifests externally,\nAnd the Mysterious Function is fulfilled.'*\n\nThe song declares:\n*\"Without stars, none bow to Heaven’s Enclosure—\nOnly the true mechanism lies in the dim and distant.\"*\n\nThus, the *Chénjī* (Polaris) is the *heart of Heaven*,\nWith rectitude as its square—\nFacing the peak of *Kūnlún*,\nLocated in the *Purple Palace* of the Northern Pole, *Zhàngdōng*.\n\nAt the center of Heaven,\nWithin the Four Auxiliaries,\nBeneath the *Huágài* (Celestial Canopy),\nIt is the *heart of Heaven*.\n\nStill and unchanging—\nIt is the Master of the Primordial *Qi*,\nThe pivot and axis of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe song declares:\n*\"The true Yang encloses the *qi* in ceaseless motion,\nAscending and descending through the Three Palaces in secret,\nLife and death do not concern the floating world’s affairs—\nTogether they lead the Five Elders to the Golden Platform.\"*\n\nThe Five Elders are the spirits of the Five *Zàng* (Viscera),\nEach man has them naturally—\nThe twelve nodes, the thirty-six minute bones,\nEach pore aligned, each pulse connected,\nEach node linked.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches its peak,\nThen *golden sinews and jade bones*,\nThe hundred limbs uncorrupted,\nThe pure *qi* ascends to become Heaven—\nPure yet purer, spirit yet more spirit,\nYang yet more Yang.\n\nMan receives the Primordial *Qi* of Heaven and is born,\nFrom the Three Pure Ones dividing their Three *Qi* into the Three Primordials—\nThe Upper *Dān Tiān* (Elixir Field) *Ní Wán Fǔ* (Mud Pellet Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Jade Purity* Green *Qi*;\nThe Middle *Dān Tiān* *Jiàng Gōng Fǔ* (Vermilion Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Upper Purity* White *Qi*;\nThe Lower *Dān Tiān* *Jiāo Huì Fǔ* (Convergence Palace),\nAscending to correspond with the *Supreme Purity* Yellow *Qi*.\n\nThis is what was spoken of earlier—\n*\"Preserving essence to enter the spirit.\"*\n\nThe *Supreme Purity* true soil,\nNot the thick, heavy, and turbid earth of the world—\nThe transforming origin of all things.\n\nHeaven unifies the Three Palaces as one,\nEnduring through ten thousand ages without flaw.\nThe Three Palaces ascend and descend,\nAscending and descending without end—\nThis is what is meant!\n\nTo know one’s own Three Pure Ones—\nWhy seek above?\nTo know one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*—\nWhy search externally?\n\nThe *Supreme Sage* says:\n*\"Essence is my spirit,\n*Qi* is my Dao.\nPreserve essence and nurture *qi*,\nGuard and uphold firm rectitude.\n\nWhen Yin and Yang unite,\nThe true form is established—\nAnd the transformation generates the Boy Child.\nTest the breath at the nostrils—\nIt does not reach the ears.\nSpeak with the mouth—\nIt does not shake the lungs.\nThen the elixir vein forms itself.\"*\n\n*Qi* transforms into essence,\nEssence transforms into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into the Boy Child of the Heart.\n\nWithin my body reside the thirty-six thousand spirits,\nEver attending at my side.\n\nIf this is maintained over time,\nThen one’s own Three Pure Ones, one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*, will appear!\n\nGreat are the mysteries of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars!\nThe Seven Stars’ true names and forms—\nThey are the Seven *Qi* of the Primordial Beginning,\nAlso the true *Qi* of the seven orifices within the human body.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Dipper Stars traverse the twelve *Zhī* (Earthly Branches) above,\nThe *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* (Child-Midday-Male Ox-Western Maid) palaces—\nWithin them lies the path to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred!\n\nThus, the fourth star *Wén Qū* (Literature Weaver),\nIs the gate of Yin-Yang convergence—\nThe *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* positions where man is born.\nThe *ào-mǎo* (Male Ox-Western Maid) convergence occurs here,\nAnd moreover, within Yin there is Yang,\nWithin Yang there is Yin—\nThis is called the *Two-Eight* Gate.\n\nThe *Dān* (Alchemy) Classics say:\n*\"The Dragon moves through the sixteen gates,\nThe Tiger hides in the nine and three doors—\nWithin the Heavenly Pass,\nIts path is the Mysterious Extremity.\"*\n\nMan can understand the mutual use of Yin and Yang,\nThe interplay of *Wū-Tù* (Heavenly Hare),\nThus the Dao’s *Qi* increases,\nAnd the elixir spirit is accomplished.\n\nThe *Huáng Tíng* (Yellow Court) Classics say:\n*\"Within the Three Passes, essence, *Qi*, and spirit reside,\nWithin the Nine Profound, profound yet more profound.\nThe mouth is the Heavenly Pass—spirit’s mechanism,\nThe hands are the Human Pass—holding the flourishing and decline,\nThe feet are the Earthly Pass—life’s threshold.\nAnd within the Dipper, the Three Passes are possessed—\nThe Heavenly Pass is at *wǔ*,\nThe Human Pass is at *ào-mǎo*,\nThe Earthly Pass is at *zi-wǔ*.\nThe Yin-Yang boundary positions,\nThe *ào-mǎo* doors where sun and moon enter and exit.\"*\n\nReflect now!\nThe Mysterious is the origin of all things,\nIts principle inherent.\n\nThe hidden Mysterious of things,\nNot as hidden as the Mysterious within the human body—\nThe Mysterious within the human body,\nIs the Heavenly Mechanism,\nThe Mysterious Function.\n\nThus the *Yīn Fú* (Dark Seal) Classics say:\n*\"The sacred function is born from it,\nThe spirit and light emerge from it!\"*\n\nIt is known:\nThe Mysterious is the origin of *Qi*,\nThe true of the Dao,\nHeaven’s hue,\nThe marvel of the Law,\nThe

thousand,\nBalancing all beings, kin, and grudges,\nOnly then does one fulfill the true wish of the Immortals.\"*\n\nIndeed, the completion of the Golden Elixir\nIs Heaven’s reward for the greatly virtuous.\nIf one does not cultivate hidden virtue\nBut merely seeks to steal the Great Dao,\nThen Heaven will not aid them.\nEven if they begin the practice,\nDemons will soon arise to obstruct,\nOr for years they toil in vain,\nOnly to blame the Dao or the Master,\nAnd thus bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nBut if there are those who truly seek the Dao,\nEver mindful, compassionate, and aiding beings,\nRescuing the poor, relieving suffering,\nCherishing life, saving all sentient beings,\nEncouraging loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness,\nAnd performing all manner of hidden virtues—\nSuch as truly sparing life,\nOr practicing skillful means to abstain from killing—\nThen the Immortals will recommend them,\nThe Celestial Sovereign will bestow blessings.\nThey will swiftly
