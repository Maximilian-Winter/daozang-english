  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*\nAuthor unknown, originating in the late Northern and Southern Dynasties. Originally in seven scrolls, now extant in five scrolls and five sections.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons***\n**Section: The True Elixir, Mysterious Radiance, Lofty Numinosity**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord expounded the *Preface to the Mysterious Radiance of the True Elixir from the Great Wisdom Texts of the Supreme Clarity for Dispelling Demons*. The Golden Portal Emperor, who had attended the discourse, later reported it to the Azure Lad, saying: “This is what is spoken of in the *Supreme Clarity Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*. It can expel evil and cure illness, drive away spirits and remove harm, disperse the demonic *qi* of the Six Heavens, and subdue the incursions of the myriad specters. To recite this chapter is to wield the divine tiger’s branches and stems, employing the true *qi* in secret practice.”\n\nThose of the highest rank may transmit it to Daoist adepts whose predestined true names were established before their studies. If, before their training, they were assailed by demonic hordes, or if, while dwelling in their chambers, they were afflicted by ghostly maladies—should they recite it by day in their rooms and [meditate upon it] by night in their hearts, then the hundred evils will retreat afar, and their spirits will open and their minds become luminous.\n\nThe Azure Lad received the teachings with reverence and recorded them in the *Divine Talismans*.\n\nThe elixirs of the Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and Great Ultimate are sufficient to repel the hundred ghosts—how much more so when one ingests their substances?\n\nThe immortals of the Nine Palaces have never beheld the chapters of this scripture, nor have the perfected of the Great Ultimate transmitted the great scripture of wisdom.\n\nThis scripture is bestowed upon disciples who comprehend emptiness; it is not conferred upon those whose true names remain upon the earth. Only when one has attained the Dao and ascended to the Great Ultimate may it be transmitted to those worthy of receiving it.\n\nWhat the Most High has now expounded is but a single word among ten thousand from the *Scripture of Wisdom*—though one’s true name may exist upon the earth, if one has not yet departed to study the Dao, there is no karmic affinity to hear it in full. Thus, this scripture cannot be fully revealed.\n\nTo hear its opening title is to know the name of its elixir—it is the Jade Scripture of Supreme Clarity for those with true destiny.\n\nThe Azure Lad received the teachings with reverence and later transmitted them to Master Red Pine.\n\nBefore Master Red Pine attained the Dao, he fell gravely ill in the Golden Flower Mountains, suffering for sixteen years. Though he meditated upon the true and preserved his essence, his afflictions did not abate. During this time, he calmed his heart and sought the Dao, refining his spirit and guarding stillness. He did not grieve over his suffering nor regard life and death as matters of concern.\n\nFor the numinous ghosts of the Six Heavens disrupt the true with illness, or celestial beings may instruct demons to induce sickness—all to test the resolve of the heart, to observe whether one treads the path of water and fire with rectitude or deviation. Such is the trial of illness.\n\nMaster Red Pine, while fasting and convalescing, recited the *Scripture of Wisdom* and intoned the *Dispelling Demons* section three thousand times. Thereupon, his ailments were entirely cured, his mind opened, and his spirit became luminous—surpassing even his state before illness.\n\nIllness serves four purposes: first, to test the sincerity of the heart; second, to purge the impurities of the lower corpse; third, to eliminate unrighteousness; and fourth, to refine worldly defilements.\n\nIf one steadfastly aligns the heart, strengthens resolve, seeks the Dao, and guards the spirit, yearning for the mysterious teachings, then illness may dissipate in an instant. But if one is deluded by sickness and allows the heart to waver, if one’s devotion is unsteady and the will wanders, if one’s sincerity is half-hearted, then illness may persist until dawn.\n\nLater, Master Red Pine attained the Dao in the Great Mount Huo, ascended to the Golden Portal, and received the scriptures as the Perfected of the Great Void—his true name having long been recorded in Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Scripture of Wisdom* is also called the *Great Simplicity Cavern Scripture* or the *Transmission of Pristine Wisdom*. It comprises seven scrolls, stored within the Jade Clarity’s portal, in the chambers of the Lofty Void Sovereign’s cinnabar abode.\n\nThree thousand jade maidens of pristine numinosity are ever in attendance upon these seven scrolls, whence it is also titled the *Great Simplicity Cavern Scripture*.\n\nThe wise recognize the August Emperor of the Sun’s zenith; the enlightened regard the urgency of ceaseless generation. The character for “wisdom” (*hui*) contains two “life” (*sheng*) radicals side by side, both riding upon the sign of “urgency.”\n\nThose with cultivated intent follow the words of the *Scripture of Wisdom*; those without it heed the dual teachings of the Most High Dao Lord.\n\nOne must recite them in sequence to completion, totaling three thousand repetitions. If the count is incomplete and one pauses, one must begin anew from the first repetition.\n\nDuring prolonged fasting in a purified chamber, after reciting with focused mind, one must sever all external distractions. One must not pause midway, for to do so invites tribulation upon the body. The jade lads will report to the Three Offices, and the matter will be memorialized to the Golden Portal—this must not be taken lightly.\n\nThose who study the Dao must recite it to completion, for it dispels evil, illuminates the spirit, opens the mind, scatters ignorance, eliminates specters, harmonizes *qi*, and infuses the body with true essence.\n\nFirst, fast for fifty days, then begin recitation. Cup the hands in reverence, utter the words clearly, neither hastily nor carelessly.\n\nAfter mastering it, one will grasp its wonders, and numinous beings may descend to impart understanding. One who comprehends its purport may also soar through the Great Void—such is the Perfected of the Great Void. Ten thousand recitations are most excellent. On the day the practice is complete, the cloud chariot will arrive.\n\nThis Dao surpasses the thirty-nine sections of the *Cavern Scriptures*, yet what is received is but a ten-thousandth part of the *Scripture of Wisdom*—how much more vast is the profound garden of its seven scrolls!\n\nHowever, the statutes and methods of the Four Poles may not be transmitted to perfected ones who have not yet ascended to heaven from the earthly realm.\n\nOn days of fasting and purification, it is best to recite this scroll in full. Yet the impoverished in spirit cannot achieve this. If one merely peruses the divine texts in the mundane world or listens to their recitation, it does not count toward the required number of focused recitations during fasting.\n\nOne should first briefly study the rules and procedures, become familiar with the guidelines, and only then fast and recite. Three thousand repetitions constitute one completion; two sets of three thousand, one attainment; three sets of three thousand, one entry; and four sets of three thousand, one luminosity.\n\nThe *Red Writ of Yu Yi* constitutes the Four Luminosities, dispersed as the *Responsive Scenery*. One must not glance at it briefly beforehand, then recite it once familiar—lest carelessness lead to oversight. This is the great taboo of the Eastern Statutes of the Azure Lad, causing one’s eyes to lose their steadfast radiance. Beware!\n\nOne should fix one’s gaze steadily upon the characters, reciting them slowly in a soft voice. If interrupted or misread, return and reread thirty characters from the stopping point. Purify yourself, burn incense, rinse your mouth, and face east at dawn to begin—just as when composing the *Yellow Writ of Lin*, known as the *Supreme Dao of Gentle Dawn*.\n\nDuring recitation, observe the three intervals of eating and rest: at chen, wu, and you hours. From nightfall until dawn, the cycle is complete. If, upon finishing one completion, one does not immediately fast and recite again, the timing may be adjusted at will, without mutual constraint. Should one wish to read further after one completion, one must fast anew as at the beginning.\n\nWithin the Terrace of Writing, the inscription on the *Utterly Remote Western Mountain* and the *Northern Absolute Stone* reads: *\"Inducement and assembly, ever joyous, refined and augmented discourse—this is the essence of the Dao, the luminous and expansive wisdom that comes with gentle and enlightened recitation.\"*\n\nThe meaning of this text is largely to encourage diligent study and recitation. The *Supreme Clarity Great Wisdom Writ*, the *True Elixir for Dispelling Demons*, the *Mysterious and Lofty Numinous Registers*, and the *Preface of the Highest Scriptures* received by the Supreme Dao Lord—these enable one to soar upon the wheel of the Great Void and sever the qi of the Six Heavens.\n\nThis scripture comprises seven scrolls, treasured and concealed by the Supreme Dao Lord. The Azure Lad has now excerpted and compiled one ten-thousandth of the *Dispelling Demons* chapters, interspersing them among the divine talismans.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao bestowed upon the Supreme Great Dao Lord the *Divine Tiger Grand Talisman*, the *Golden Tiger True Talisman*, and the *Writ of Pristine Wisdom*, commanding Lord Wang to transmit them to the *Knowers of the True*. He further instructed the Azure Lad to transmit them to the *Achievers of the True*. The *Knowers of the True* are those who attain truth through wisdom; the *Achievers of the True* are those who obtain truth through diligent seeking.\n\nThis text is to be transmitted solely by these two lords to those whose names are inscribed in the *Jade Writ of the Mysterious*. Other perfected ones must not rashly transmit it. Thus, the Supreme Lord instructed the Golden Gate Emperor of Later Saints, who entrusted it to the Two Lords of the Highest Minister and Highest Chancellor. Within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted thrice, first by sworn covenant. Once the covenant is complete, the transmission proceeds. Those who view it without covenant shall, for seven generations, be examined by the Three Yin Water Officials.\n\nThe Three Yin are the Three Officials of the Five Emperors, who govern the life and death of sinners. The First, the Left Official, judges the sins of the living. The Second, the Right Official, judges the sins of the dead. The Third, the Female Official, judges the sins of women. Additionally, the Left Water Official governs those who recklessly speak of heaven and earth, divulge celestial patterns, defame the Two Images, or offend the Three Luminaries. The Right Fire Official governs those who commit great treason, kill living beings, harm their masters or lords, or plot against their parents—crimes as vast as mountains.\n\nThe Five Palaces lie beneath Mount Tai, in the northern void of the cavern-heaven of Mount Tai. This small heaven spans four thousand li in circumference, entirely occupied by the Three Officials. Within the Mysterious are the Three Great Voids: the Jade Clarity Great Void, the Supreme Clarity Great Void, and the Supreme Ultimate Great Void. Within the Mysterious are the Three Voids; the Cavern is likewise so.\n\nThe Great Void lies beneath Mount Tai and above the Cavern-Heaven. The Cavern-Heaven lies beneath the Great Void and above the palaces of the perfected ones. The Nine Palaces of the Great Clarity also contain the Three Great Emptinesses. The Great Emptiness lies beneath the Supreme Ultimate Cavern-Heaven, within the void of the Five Peaks.\n\nThe Supreme Lord expounded on wisdom:\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao stood to the left of the Supreme Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord was at leisure in the Chamber of Harmonious Dawn within the Numinous Observatory, his seat arrayed with the Ninefold Purple Radiance of the Mysterious. To his right stood six great lion-like beasts. Then the True Person Jian Sheng and the Jade Clarity Divine Woman Fang Su, bearing the incense and blossoms of the Flying Qi of Vermilion Mound and holding the profound and subtle hidden chapters, took their places. The Supreme Dao Lord rinsed his mouth with azure water, exhaled crimson qi, calmed his heart, stilled his body, and concentrated his spirit upon the Mysterious. Girded with the Divine Tiger on his left and the Golden True Talisman on his right, he intoned the *Supreme Writ of Wisdom*, the *Supreme Chapters for Dispelling Demons with Numinous Elixirs*, the *Eight Mysteries*, the *Nine Perfected*, the *Seven Gates*, and the *Three Candles*.\n\nHe spoke of emptiness and nothingness, of the profound and recondite, of the thousand truths halting the wheel and the ten thousand spirits coming to rest. The numinous sounds soared upward, the will inscribed boundless fortune. Exquisite tones played in harmony, resonating like gold and jade. Above, they illuminated the hidden and obscure; below, they illumined the latent and concealed. The Mysterious Model flowed in elegance; the divine gaze was swift and keen. The Dao’s convergence knew no bounds; the rare melody awakened the profound. The whirlwind’s qi extended into the void; dust and ruins accumulated in the realm. Thus, the Mysterious Pearl possessed a radiance of longing, and the clear mirror stirred the records of tranquility.\n\nThe Great Dao was distant and complete; flying light shone afar. Each step stirred the numinous stream, startling the waves into pristine flight. Sinking into the Ninefold Darkness, one could scarcely hope to loosen one’s fetters. Transformations arose without expectation; abiding left no trace. Changes soared in the yang; rare was the dwelling in virtue’s radiance. The Twin Gates of Serenity and Joy led back to the awakening of principle’s subtleties. The Great Image of Uncarved Simplicity steadied the multitude; the vast river was set in motion. The Mysterious and the Cavern interpenetrated; principle’s subtlety connected the minute. One roamed and played with the divine blade, floating upon the vast expanse. Stirring the hundred yang, lightning was born; drumming the thousand yin, might was unleashed. The Six Heavens lost their qi; the Nine Demons were shattered and destroyed.\n\nGrasping the sun and vast rosy clouds, ten thousand mists entered the breast. In stillness, one harmonized with heaven and earth; in motion, one matched the radiance of the Seven Luminaries. In repose, one was secure though not secure; in peril, one was safe though not safe. One’s illumination pierced the waves and mist, binding the true and releasing the perching. At the Harmonious Dawn, the Two Absolutes intermingled; with a glance, the ten thousand darknesses opened of themselves. Thus, one’s feet trod the Seven Degrees, one’s hands held the Heavenly Mechanism. One’s crown covered the Mysterious Luminaries, uniting and returning the Two Modes. Rivers and mountains collapsed and burst; the Four Qi flowed and shifted. A hundred million hard and bright stones swiftly crumbled; the ears were suddenly opened. The numinous measure encompassed the falling, and the One Mysterious returned. Only those whose spirits were whole and whose emptiness was employed, whose wondrous melody soared in the Mysterious, could stir the Great Void without turning, give birth to the host of winds from the latent and keen, raise the Eight Luminaries to ascend, and lift the flying reins to the Clear Governance. They rode the carefree phoenix chariot to gaze from on high, released the cloud carriage to roam freely, rejoiced in the Nine Distances to cross the vast, soared upon the Purple Heaven to halt the Vermilion Radiance, delighted in the Seven Sources to circulate qi, crowned the Azure Ford to pour into the Crimson Well. The whirlwind, mist, waves, and lightning arose with the wondrous body; the void was stilled, the divine was revered, and the numinous ladder was eternally severed.\n\nThe Vermilion Radiance now blazed forth, branching into the Mysterious River. Folding their wings to observe transformation, they soared toward the Empty Net. Myriad distinctions merged in reflection, the flying wheels ascending to Jade Align. Phoenixes trilled, dragons leapt, tigers roared, and phoenixes sang. Ten thousand echoes scattered like jade, a throng of gems burst into blossom. The jade grove stirred with wind, the crimson trees surged with flowers.\n\nThereupon they harmonized ten thousand tones, sending a thousand melodies aloft in flight. The numinous pattern unfurled, the cloud-neighbors revealed their forms. Vast transformation flowed at dawn, wondrous arts emerged at dusk. Loosening their sashes to roam in spirit, embracing their knees in pure serenity, they observed transformation without adornment, leveled the Mysterious without embellishment. Upright and open, they let the empty current flow; pure and flourishing, they entrusted themselves to radiant convergence. The Seven Luminaries shone eternally, neither forsaking nor prizing. Carefree and cold, they wandered the numinous; without singularity or counterpart, they revered the divine branches, singing as they walked in hidden grace.\n\nThey seized the heavens to prepare the liver, lions guarded the diaphragm. Scorching fire shielded the soul, bronze heads aligned the spirits. Long fangs and pricked ears leapt in reverse; the Lightning Father roused qi with doubled soles. Baring teeth and drawing in feet, the Thunder Duke clashed and pressed. Six eyes surveyed the camp, five tigers roared in unison. They bit blades to pursue evil, fierce beasts drove out filth. Rushing qi and thunder essence preserved life from falling.\n\nYet these numinous birds first arose from human movement. The Dao likewise aids life: ascending peaks to congeal spirit, shaking and parting the towering, they dispelled the Nine Calamities. Without thought, without emotion, they harmonized the Eight Images. Vessels of the Mysterious, qi light, they gazed sevenfold through the layered heavens, trailing fragrant blossoms and crimson splendor. Not-smoke blazed with numinosity; the potter’s wheel aligned with the True. They scattered simplicity, rinsed names, rinsed and savored the numinous brush. Spirit and qi leveled and cleared, they entrusted themselves to the waves of the Two Heavens. Lofty fragrance perfumed the dark; jade maidens held incense, purple consorts bore jars. They poured into the Celestial Pool, scattered flowers in the Jade Court. They issued summons to armored riders, marshaled the Heavenly Hosts. Poisonous dragons spewed yin, divine tigers deployed troops. Externally, they coiled with Mysterious qi; internally, they prepared the Seven Cities. Before the Dao descended to unite, they relied on might to give birth. The True achieved equal virtue; primordial qi merged with the Mysterious.\n\nThus the Jade Clarity Celestial Perfected, their hearts without empty shores, dwelled high in the Absolute Dark, embracing cinnabar in the cloud ravine. Extending to the adepts of the Supreme Dao, they contained brilliance and shone naturally. Reaching the adepts of supreme virtue, they savored solitude in the hidden and scattered. The Mysterious did not await the True; the signpost did not initiate radiance. They soared with the Great Dao by the banks of the Zhuang River, rising in emptiness to respond to the moment. Subtle and constant, their melody flew on distant strings, sound not awaiting plucking. The Nine Harmonies’ Mysterious resonance, the empty same in ultimate repose—thus they could sever their hearts beyond heaven, wondrously unite in a single vision.\n\nFrom this point onward, all were the dragon-luminaries of the Four Marshes, emitting essence as hidden immortals. They roamed in dreams through Jade Clarity, entrusted their forms to the Supreme Leisure. Waves reflected as they ascended the void; hands pushed aside the Eight Thousand. Bodies shook the Purple Whip; scarlet caps crowned lotuses. They blazed through the Seven Valleys, flew fragrance to rinse the mist. Essence pierced the Great Void; virtue and merit reached the Nine Heavens. They wore the sun and moon, dwelled serenely in the vast expanse. Flying wheels turned to the Northern Mound; loosened sashes wandered the Flower Garden. The Queen Mother of the West commanded the reins; they rode as companions to Turtle Mountain. Fourfold, they spread great grace; wondrously, they chanted the Supreme Mystery. The Six Yin’s beauty galloped forth to fulfill past affinities. Those whose virtue had not yet attained the distant, whose hearts had not awakened to the True, were all bestowed with jade fangs and lush blossoms, the Seven Yangs’ solar infants, the Nine Forest’s liquid, the Eight Jade’s essence, the Four Pistils’ purple nectar, the Five Pearls’ crimson bloom, the Three Flowers’ flying steel, the Twin Pearls’ lunar radiance. Orchid wine and golden grain, sweet dew in jade vases, azure silk and tender gauze, drifting mushrooms and flowing numinosity, divine channels and cinnabar dispersal, Mysterious boughs entwined, jade roots knotted at dawn. The Western August One’s plain abundance—with these they could soar through the Vermilion Empyrean, fly through the void of Jade Clarity. Inhaling to absorb them, they reached the True Numinous; rinsing to transform them, they entered the Purple Court. They could also take the Eastern Culmen’s Weaving Maiden’s water, the Western Limit’s Long Dusk and Yuqian, the Southern Exhaustion’s root of solar light, or the Northern Depths’ Palace of Grand Yin’s night.\n\nThereupon, in the vermilion summer, yang congealed; the radiant whirlwind soared afar. The Great Void plucked essence; the Two Images circled in light. The Eight Paths harmonized; riding the solemn, they conveyed fragrance. Transformation governed the Nine Absolutes; virtue flowed through the Jade Emperor. The three gates of the profound opened; the four divine portals spread wide. Auspicious clouds constructed the heavens; the Six Perfections brought felicity. Numinous winds scattered demons; the Dharma drum summoned troops. They roamed the shores to bathe in the azure waves, washing the soul and transforming the spirit, all gathering in the Dao site. Plucking the pure, grasping the panpipes, they harmonized qi to preserve longevity. Ingesting the blossoms’ essence, they aided external harmony. Below, they drew from the Mysterious current; above, they pushed open the empty same.\n\nI, unlearned and young, once played at the Dao’s lineage. Formerly, through virtue’s elevation, I was made an Immortal Sovereign. Flying and falling, I shed the world, soaring above the empty same. Scaled, I swam the dark ford; shaking, I stirred the celestial river. Morning and evening, amidst the host of immortals, I attended to life and death below. Suddenly, I heard of the Supreme Dao above Jade Clarity, the Mysterious Shore of the Utmost True. My aspiration yearned and my head lifted; I sat waiting for dawn. What fault was mine alone to indulge in this petty feast? How could I long be stained by the world’s dust, forever to be the Supreme August One’s delight?\n\nThereupon, I set aside the immortal’s scriptures, removed the crown of former ages. Though my body still wandered the flourishing groves, my heart dwelled beyond images. Vaguely, I sought lofty eminence, the jade pipes’ rare sound. Then I bid farewell to glory, scattered blossoms, shook my staff to ascend the lofty peaks. Chewing the qi-less, I drew in the Two Luminaries. Raising my wings, I journeyed like the wild swan, exhausting spirit to probe the towering. Silent and empty within, I gathered qi and tilted the tripod. In solitude, I guarded the Mysterious; through spring’s end, I sealed stillness. My insipid body self-lost, the corpse unbound and unkempt. Releasing form to preserve emptiness, I held nothing, grasped nothing.\n\nThen I opened the cavern gate in the Sparse Grove, sought the numinous traces in the Cinnabar Cavern. I dispatched the Nine Heavens’ vermilion casket, gazed toward the Jade Tablets of Supreme Clarity. The Mysterious Writ was engraved on jade tablets; the crimson name was first inscribed on the empty watchtower. I roamed the Five Peaks; ten thousand crags I visited in full. A hundred valleys, a thousand peaks—none I did not tread in sequence. Once I glimpsed the Jade Steps in the Purple Clarity’s clouds; twice I beheld the divine script in the brocade-clouded satchel. Four times I encountered the Three Primes in the Mysterious Terrace; six times I visited the Five Elders in the Numinous Chamber. Nine times I was carried by the Great Emperor; seven times I rode alongside the Highest in the same chariot. Then the heavenly gates spread wide, plainly penetrating the dark and bright. Extending the wheels, turning the carriage, I attended the high court’s grand assembly. Feathered capes and brocade robes, flowing bells and singing flutes, dragon crowns and phoenix skirts followed the clouds in carefree wandering. Dark and boundless, they equaled the morning; heart vast, body distant. Then I realized my past: healing the limping dragon’s hoard. Now I rise like the phoenix’s whirlwind—at this moment, truly self-sufficient and self-amused, I feast forever in the Purple Palace.\n\nTo fathom the profound and measure the ultimate is especially difficult when facing the void—only then does one realize that the wondrous numinous observation of the Dao holds a thousandfold path. When the feet are whole and sound, and the mysterious heart stands firm as a wall, one then knows the fortune of seeking the steadfastness of the heart and the wholeness of the feet. Thus, many follow its lineage, but few reach its extremity.\n\nYet with an unyielding heart, one ascends to the jade purity of the True One’s resonance; with an unobstructed journey, one seeks the firmness of ultimate life. Only then may one attain jade radiance to equal illumination and ultimately receive the extended countenance of the Thearch. To wander aimlessly is to hope for nothing after ten thousand attempts; to focus single-mindedly is to have hope fulfilled ten thousandfold.\n\nThose who cling to external passions and seek refuge in mere existence, upon hearing the Dao, crawl forward on their knees—yet when the Dao remains silent, all vanish. Facing the mountains, their legs grow numb with cold; crossing the rivers, their blood surges in waves. Their five limbs assail one another over unfallen valleys, their whole body trembles on the brink of life and death. Such efforts merely exhaust their allotted years in toil, serving as mere adornments to fame and reputation. All this arises from a scattered, unfocused heart and a drifting, unstable nature. Day by day, their distractions grow, yet they remain unaware, corrupting rectitude and losing resolve, wandering lost in the forest of the Dao’s dream—how could they be worthy of the supreme Way?\n\nNow I shall reveal to you the transcendent arts of the numinous truth, the methods of celestial immortality, the grand esoteric essentials, and the *Scripture of Eternal Preservation in the Upper Realm*. If you wish to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, journey north to the Jade Thearch, spur the dragon to ride the light, and dwell in the palaces of the Upper Clarity; if you wish to hurl the jade wheels, turn the five celestial bodies, merge with the sun to radiate brilliance, and enter the moon to pierce its clarity—you must obtain the *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* and wear the divine *Golden Tiger Talisman*.\n\nWith the *Crimson Text of Yu Yi*, you may summon the sun to rise together; with the *Yellow Chapters of Jie Lin*, you may dwell with the moon. The *Cavernous True Scripture* allows you to roam with the five celestial bodies; the *Great Cavern True Scripture* scatters enmity across seven generations. Its thirty-nine chapters enable seven generations of ancestors to ascend as immortals. The *Eight Ways of the Yellow Elder* and the *Nine Numinous Writs*—the *Purple Text of the Ascending Numinous Writ* refines and restrains the hun and po; the *Golden Watchtower* records the annals. The *Treasure Registers of the Five Elders*, the *Hundred Mushrooms of the Jade Court*, the *Essence Medicines of the Upper Clarity*, and the *Excerpts from the Jade Clarity Scripture of Wisdom*—these declare:\n\nSix pure blossoms flourish, the eight-cornered radiance of the mysterious light; the seeds of wind and cloud, the jade threshold of the Thearch’s terrace; golden petals of the *jia* blossom, the vast yellow trees of heaven; the jade buds of Changcheng, the fire-jade of Mount Ye; the singing of the phoenix grove in Lu, the jade wine of the Western Jasper; the purple honey of the Central Hua, the green mounds of the Northern Ling; the golden marrow of the Crimson Ford, the moon’s essence and sun’s longevity; the *lang* seeds of the Vermilion River, the patterned gourds of Penglai; the seven stems of Zhuo Water, the lightning willows of collapsing peaks; plucking the green onions of the Northern Xuan Guo, sipping the crimson honey of cloud and water; the bones of the Night Ox, the yellow lacquer of the divine *wu*; the *ling* melons of Kongtong, one fruit every four kalpas; the gall of the *lin* in the Dark City, the midnight sun of Flame Mountain; gathering the cinnabar mulberries of Fusang above, harvesting the standing algae of the Long Abyss below; harmonizing the flying jade of the nine transformations above, swallowing the rosy treasures of the Azure Mystery below; the Great Void’s linked rings, the embrace of the Plain Girl; the purple *qiu* lads, the nine-colored phoenix brains; the hidden mushrooms of the Great Ultimate, the crimson trees of the sun’s path; the rainbow plums of the Supreme, the great herbs of the Celestial Han; the giant pearls of the Southern Palace, the *fu* elders of the Western Land; the three-beamed dragon flowers, sought by the numinous consorts—those who consume these will age only after heaven itself.\n\nThis is what the Jade Clarity consumes, what the Supreme treasures—enabling one to ascend and soar through the luminous clouds, divide the morning into myriad paths, guard and stabilize the imperial essence, and infuse the nine brains with morning light.\n\nYet this Way is vast and supremely subtle, its numinous radiance distant—it is not something those who consume blood and flesh may fully comprehend. Merely hearing its mysterious tones scatters the turbid; listening to its wind and qi dispels the impure. Above, it can float beyond the grand primordial; below, it can dispel demons and cure illnesses. Without a resonant root of virtue, who could merge with its numinous ease?\n\nThus, the highest method dispels demons by ordering qi through the myriad connections; the names of the supreme true medicines nurture the spirit and expel evil. Truly, these words are trustworthy.\n\nNext are the *Mysterious Mushrooms of the Upper Clarity* and the *Nine Seasons of the Supreme*. There are the *Eight Radiant Great Harmonies*, the *Mottled Dragon’s Black Embryo*, the *Patterned Tiger’s White Foam* from the Western Mound; the *Seven Dark Flying Nodes*, the *Nine-Aperture Jade Pearls*; the *Cloud Nectar* and *Jasper Wine*, the *Lang Yu* of the *Xuan Garden*; the *White Glue of Mount Zhong*, the *Golden Bloom of Green Spread*; the *Stone Brains of Langfeng*, the *Coral of the Black River*; the *White Phoenix of Mount Meng*, the *Jade Veins of the Numinous Mound*; the *Golden Blood of the Azure Luan*, the *Vermilion Leaves of Dongying*; the *Nine-Node Intertwined*, the *Purple Hemp of the Great Tenuity*; the *Jade Fruits of Qionghua*, the *Whale Pearls of Flowing Abyss*; the *Crimson Walls of the Red River*—drawing from the *Great Ultimate’s Well* at the center, plucking the *Crimson Veins of Wen Zhu*; the *Divine Peaches of the Cloud Court*, the *Flat Sparrows of Kun Garden*; the *Sun Grass of Night Essence*, the *Green Reed of Azure Ford*; the *Fragrant Altars of the True Palace*, the *Three Canopies of the Dark Capital*—wearing the light of the *Jade Lads* on the left, drawing the qi of the *Jade Maidens* on the right; summoning the *Divine Origin* above, drinking the *Mysterious Ripple* below; grasping the *Jade Essence of the Orchid Garden* above, plucking the *Purple [Herb]* of the Round Mound below; the *Spiritual Clams of White Water*, the *Red Scallions of the Eight Heavens*—one fruit every ten thousand years, nine ranks of flowing light. Those who consume these will depart after heaven itself.\n\nThis is what the Heavenly Thearch consumes, what the Supreme treasures—unheard of in the Great Ultimate, unattainable by the middle immortals. Reciting its chapters grants eternal life in the extraordinary currents; chanting its names can cure illnesses and sever demons. For the *Scriptures of Wisdom* dispel demons, their excerpts distilled from wondrous images; the *Numinous Mushrooms* and *Supreme Medicines*, the *Pure Songs of the True Thearch*, are but rough stimulants within the gaze of the Dao.\n\nWearing talismans and bearing the true, reciting the *Nine Simplicities*—this may suffice to fathom the natures of the myriad demons. Embracing the origin and receiving qi, studying the *Jade Mystery* at dawn—one must guard it beyond ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe four *hun* and nine *po* thus fulfill their functions within the body—using them brings joy beyond measure.\n\nNext are the grades of the Great Ultimate, the four true constant treasures: the *Nine Stones Refined in Smoke*, the *Elixir Liquid and Jade Nourishment*; the *Flowing Pearls of Xunshou*, the *Jasper Essence of Linhua*; the *Golden Liquid of the Cinnabar Furnace*, the *Purple Flowers and Rainbow Blossoms*; the *Nine Transformations of the Great Clarity*, the *Nectar of the Five Clouds*; the *Mysterious Frost and Descending Snow*, the *Leaping Three Yellows*; the *White Incense of Dongying*, the *Green Coins of Canglang*; the *Surplus Grain of High Mounds*, the *Flying Fields of Accumulated Stones*; the *Returning Elixir of the Great Void*, the *Mysterious Firmness of Taiqin*; the *Flowing Herbs of Eternal Light*, the *Flying Thousands of Cloud Lads*—these too enable one to ascend lightly and soar into the ethereal darkness.\n\nThese are the substances consumed by the Heavenly Transcendents, the studies pursued by the soaring spirits—beyond the ken of wandering scholars or mountain recluses. One must further master the *Nine Transformations and Ten Changes*, the *Eight Hidden Earth Arts*, only then can one roam boundlessly through the Mysterious Void, stride backward along the Celestial River’s banks, ride clouds and mount dragons, soaring without limit.\n\nNext are the *Thirty-Six Mushrooms*, the *Flying Furnace’s Refined Smoke*, the *Yang Water and Moon Essence*, the *Five Stones’ Richness*—which replenish the five viscera, refine the countenance, and transform the body. There are also the *Radiant Petals and Cloud Fragments*, the *Golden Powder and Jade Tenderness*, which can prolong life and extend years, granting longevity up to ten thousand years.\n\nFurther still are the *Mysterious Water and Cloud Essence Elixir*, the *Five Yellows’ Profound Spirit*, the *Thousand-Stone Jade Draft*, the *Multicolored Reds and Greens*, the *White Chariot’s Flying Nodes*, the *Flowing Steed’s Purple Wood Essence*—a single dose instantly extends one’s lifespan by a thousand epochs. Daily consumption steadily lengthens life, years advancing with the medicine, destiny shifting with the elixir. These are indeed inexhaustible numinous substances, wondrous formulas of deathlessness.\n\nTo extend life by a thousand epochs, it is said, requires but a single *daogui* of the medicine. Before refining the lower elixirs, one must first prepare *Pine Resin and Shade Fat*, *Mountain Ginger and Hidden Spirit*, *Sweetflag and Asparagus*, *Giant Sesame and Yellow Essence*, *Chrysanthemum and Wolfberry*, *Cliff Honey and Poria*, *Peach Bark and Alisma*, *Weirui and Coptis*, *Cimicifuga and Rehmannia*, *Red Plates and Vermilion Blossoms*, *Cloud-Soaring Water Cassia*, and the essences of countless other substances. Though these are myriad in kind, only a fraction is mentioned here. Consuming them yields modest benefits, not eternal extension—at best, seven hundred years; at least, three or four hundred. Yet without discerning the path to enduring enjoyment, one cannot ascend to the Azure Heavens. They may restore radiance to the body, return the complexion to youthful whiteness, command a thousand spirits, and attain the rank of Earth Transcendent—traversing the Five Peaks, wandering renowned mountains—thus avoiding the certainty of death.\n\nYet one should gradually seek higher medicines to renew oneself, for such advancement is but a step on the ladder. Why cling to the old and refuse change, binding oneself to temporal limits? These arts demand gentleness, warmth, benevolence, and wholehearted sincerity—purifying the body, harmonizing the five viscera, calming the form, visualizing the spirit, preserving the hundred spirits, guarding the hun and refining the po, dispelling filth and cleansing impurities. The mind roams the *Double Mystery*, free from the desires of fleeting splendor; embracing unity, one wanders alone, unburdened by the dust of the world. Pungent spices and five acrid flavors must not pass the lips; rich, bloody flavors must not enter the intestines. Dwelling in mountain solitude, one must not pursue worldly affairs—only then can one above delve into the profound and preserve the true, summon spirits and invoke numinous talismans, and below consume the *Eight Stones* and practice *liquid and saliva* absorption.\n\nAs for the *Yin Elixir’s Internal Chamber Arts*, the benefits of the *Yellow Way and Red Qi’s* union, the essentials of *Seven-Nine Refining Essence and Exhalation*, the methods of the *Six-One Returning Elixir’s* yin-yang fusion—though these may confer the name of immortality, the *Upper Clarity* does not equate them with virtue. Though they achieve transformation, the *Supreme* does not hold them in esteem. These are the *Impure Transcendents and Tainted Perfected*—they cannot pass through the Jade Portal.\n\nMoreover, treading treacherous ice is perilous, often leading to ruin. Even those who survive remain but *Foul and Disorderly Earth Transcendents*. To aspire to lofty models is not worth attachment; to fixate on the near is to fall short of *guiding and absorbing qi*, the arts of *embryonic breathing and mind-sealing visualization*, the *Mysterious Spirit’s Central Scroll*, the *Golden Casket’s Hidden Principles*, the *Yellow Court’s Inner and Outer Scriptures*, and the *Great Clarity’s Guarding Records*. Such methods, numbering in the thousands, have all circulated among the common folk and are known to the masses. Since the middle ages, from the time of the Yellow Emperor onward, those who have ascended and transcended through these arts are as numerous as mountains—impossible to count.\n\nSuch dedication of the heart, such steadfastness in preserving essence, such firmness in upholding conduct, such resolve in purpose—possessing these four virtues, I shall help you shatter demons and ascend as a transcendent. Yet for those of unstable nature who practice these arts, even after years or decades, they may gain no benefit. Why? Some fail to grasp the principles of *guiding and absorbing breath*; others are misled by external distractions, succeeding only to fail. Some briefly gain benefits but cease at the onset of illness; others receive teachings from masters but cannot discern them. Some lack single-minded focus, their spirits scattered; others accumulate sins and offenses, violating heavenly taboos. Some arbitrarily alter scriptural formulas, adding or omitting at will. Such cases are common—these are frivolous, arrogant, and filthy individuals, given to empty words, beyond instruction.\n\nThus, the Great Dao does not spread throughout the world, and true transcendents rarely wander the earth—this is the deep fault of humanity, not the burden of our fellowship. The key lies in simplicity, free from scheming, inwardly observing the *Eight Paths*, counting the spirits and beckoning the hun, neither careless nor overprotective, reducing the *Nine Hun* to ashes, embracing unity and roaming the dark, the five viscera never straying, the *liquid and qi* mysteriously congealing. Facing death without fear, encountering the strange without faltering, releasing the celestial form into the empty vastness, gathering the spirit and harmonizing it to guard essence.\n\nThen, from what does the great trial arise? From where do illusions emerge? No metal or stone can compare to its great substance; no eight streams can rival its profound stillness. Such clarity of talent is truly heaven-born—yet it may also be swiftly attained through learning, or even achieved without seeking.\n\nStrictly speaking, transcendence cannot be forcibly sought, nor can the true be schemed for. Without the *Mysterious Registers*, one cannot hear the *Sutras of Wisdom*; without the *Jade Scriptures*, one will never see the *Divine Golden Tiger Chapters*; without ardent longing for flying transcendence, one cannot know the *Great Ultimate and Upper Clarity*.\n\nIn summary: destiny, will, essence, diligence, practicing hidden virtue, rescuing from disaster, aiding the poor and distressed, establishing benevolent deeds. Uniting these, one faces all things with a compassionate heart, never directing malice toward any living being. This is the gateway to the Dao’s essentials, the secluded chamber of attaining the Way.\n\nWith diligent recitation and contemplation of the numinous above, should you wish to convey words difficult to penetrate, at times the heart opens to comprehend the lineage, the spirit brightens and the true arrives—myriad ghosts flee in terror, grave illnesses heal without treatment, malevolent curses scatter and hide, and ailments recover instantly. This truly relies on the Divine Tiger’s might over the Six Heavens, and also on the wisdom that governs the medicine dispelling demons.\n\nA hundred fetters dissolve, the heart shines and the spirit thrives; the Six Harmonies endure in peace, the Seven Essences grow radiant. All nets of entanglement loosen and disperse, neither existing nor ceasing to exist. Great is the Supreme Perfected! Supreme is the primordial achievement of the Most High. When recitation reaches this point, bow to the four directions, greatly honoring our divine scripture, the *Yellow Dao Great Chapter of the Supreme Perfected*.\n\nShould one cease recitation before completing three thousand repetitions, one must then perform purification rites and recite another three thousand times, not counting the previous repetitions toward the total.\n\nHere ends the first scroll of *The Supreme Perfected of the Cavernous Realms Expounds the True Scripture of Wisdom Dispelling Demons*.\n\n#1 *\"Long Purification in the Proper Chamber\"* (Dunhuang manuscript reads *\"Long Purification in Mountain Forests and Tomb Chambers\"*).\n\n*The Supreme Perfected of the Cavernous Realms Expounds the True Scripture of Wisdom Dispelling Demons, Scroll Two: Entering Samādhi*\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of the Divine Tiger of the Eight Arts of the Most High’s Wisdom Dispelling Demons*—those who attain it enter samādhi and live without death across all lives. Compiled into a chapter by the Azure Lad of the Upper Rank.\n\nShould one of steadfast resolve and karmic destiny encounter this text, all who receive it must first perform purification rites, present golden dragons and jade fish, and swear solemn oaths. These are the names of the ten thousand spirits and hosts of the world, the hidden taboos of a thousand demons and ten thousand specters. Thus compiled into this writ, the Lord of the Great One ever guards it with ghostly soldiers—take care not to transmit it lightly.\n\nThe Lord of the Great Dao then plucked the *Cloud Zither of the Radiant Dragon*, its celestial tones soaring in a thousand flights, myriad echoes intertwining and surging. Resplendent harmonies billowed forth, purple mists swirling in shade, while the Eight Mystic Winds arose. Thereupon the Jade Phoenix stretched its neck, the Golden Simurgh composed its qi, dragons intoned over sapphire waves, and tigers leapt upon the divine continent. Nine whistles harmonized in chorus, the Mystic Chord resonating through the void. Subdued beasts rolled up their sleeves, fierce steeds bared their throats, mountains reared across forests, and swords were clenched to seize the perverse. A tumult of voices arose, a hundred wolves and monstrous apes clamored.\n\nThen he commanded the handmaidens of the Jade Clarity Upper Palace—An Faying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, and Cun Yunmen—to join in singing the *Divine Poetry of Expelling Spirits* and the *Melody of Dispersing Numinous Beings*. Its verses proclaimed:\n\nFloating, floating, the reins of the Great Rosy Clouds,\nEightfold ascent to the Cloud Encampment.\nThe divine lineage orders the numinous heart,\nDragon brushes adorn the Jade Capital.\nGolden gates entwine in lush abundance,\nNine chambers gleam with purple jade.\nA lofty chariot crosses the Northern Origin,\nRustling into the Unborn.\nThe Vermilion Tiger guides the

the reins to open the Primal Homeland,\nThe River Spirits have already taken the lead.\nYin clouds gird the night’s sun,\nThe candle-moon suddenly meets at first exchange.\nBinding the luminous, the unborn spirit,\nLeading together to return to the void.\nTen thousand sources pour into the Northern Valley,\nRiding the void back to the streaming stars.\nExtinguishing light to pluck the floating wanderer,\nPeaks soar like waves in the sky.\nEntwined in the abode of joyous music,\nSubtle wonders emerge toward the empty.\nThe carefree dwelling in the cinnabar and mysterious origin,\nThe Great Void’s Dao flows red and unimpeded.\nDark and bright wield the numinous tally,\nHow could hidden reckoning stray or be lost?\nThe Fallen Mystery reveals the host’s assembly,\nBirth’s beginning seems a long dream.\nVirtue conceals its traces within the subtle,\nUtter stillness unknowingly becomes.\nThe divine essence moves the Great Simplicity,\nMist and reflection dwell where they will.\nMystic echoes resound beyond the bold,\nHow could the hidden boughs give rise to doubt?\nHarmonizing with the morning drum’s long fan,\nRadiant rosy clouds arise here.\nCutting off the abyss’s dark and boundless flow,\nSoaring wings reach the Sixfold Terrace.\nThe Divine King enters the Jade Void,\nUtter nonbeing invades the vermilion troops.\nThe Nine Netherworlds meet in distant obscurity,\nThe wondrous assembly is already at peace.\nThe Dao’s treasury, the Golden Ultimate’s chapter,\nStrummed and tuned to blazing glory.\nA thousand dragons spew green waters,\nThe Nine Rivers pour out in exhaustion.\nVast mists seize the remote abode,\nNuminous waves fill the Fourfold Canopy’s court.\nHeads aligned, gazing toward the towering palace,\nNo reckoning of form or name.\nLeading and drawing in the Primal Harmony,\nFlourishing and freely grasping the Mystic Principle.\nContaining essence, blazing in the cloud chambers,\nRustling and assisting the pure, fading records.\nThe numinous Dao hastens to the Orchid Gate,\nThe Mysterious Mysterious at once arrays itself.\nTen thousand peaks are but a marvelous sight,\nAbove the clouds dwell the Jade Children.\nThrough kalpas, harmonizing with jade splendor,\nNo awareness yet begins.\nThe source spirits equal the Cavern’s transformation,\nSinking and submitting, forgetting the signs of samādhi.\nThe River Lord binds the Upper Observatory,\nThe Radiant Pearl adorns the Jasper Court.\nPrinciple has no duality beyond the void,\nHow could congealing clarity ever wane or wax?\nThe Great Yang exchanges with the Heavy Yin,\nTurning and sweeping, abiding in the fallen dark.\nTogether entrusted beyond the Six Perceptions,\nThe numinous chant unites in a single voice.\nThe turning jade pivots the Han’s Dao,\nBrilliant and resplendent, stirring the flowery jasper.\nTen thousand spirits mount vermilion steeds,\nA thousand demons have no leisure to arise.\nSpecters vanish in the Palaces of Water and Fire,\nThe true body treasures the Great Perfection.\n\nThe Four Lifespans of the Northern Alas,\nOrdering the divine, steadying the reins.\nSummoning the Earth Deities,\nThe earth spirits conceal their qi.\nMountains and peaks hide the clouds,\nThe Nine Sources are cut off and extinguished.\nPushing and examining the thousand spirits,\nSeizing captives with thunderous might.\nThe Northern Emperor opens the Dao,\nThe Four Illuminations attend the chariot.\nCrushing and shattering the ten thousand perverse,\nCarving and severing Mount Feng.\nNine ghosts share a single head,\nA thousand demons

together at the Gate of Human Life?\nThe Divine Tiger unleashes its might,\nBeheading monstrous apes and decapitating owls.\nThe wondrous Dao of the Great Nonbeing,\nThe utmost numinous selects and approves.\nYou who now receive this,\nForever wear it upon your person.\nTen thousand trials will not contest you,\nA thousand specters will not approach.\nThe Jade Splendor arrives at the chamber,\nHeavenly Perfected wander and circle.\nRecite and illumine the numinous tones,\nAscend to pay homage to the Three Origins.\n\nWhen the song concluded, the Lord of the Great Dao then commanded Yu Lixuan, the Jade Lad of the Left Mystery, to take up the Purple-Gold Feathered Staff and summon the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity condensed his refined qi, wielding the True Staff in the void. Whistling and commanding the ten thousand spirits, he marshaled the authority of the Primal Origin. Holding the Golden Truth, he gazed serenely upon the Great Origin. Suddenly hearing the command, he swiftly set forth, mounting his feathered chariot. The Vermilion Sovereign opened the Dao, and the armored Heavenly Soldiers were arrayed. Ten thousand tigers drove out the perverse, golden dragons led the troops. The Jade Staff cast its light, flying blossoms entered the dark. Turbid currents transformed the ranks, advancing to activate the Solar Essence. Striking the azure drum’s surging waves, sounding the jasper bell’s resounding peals. Thereupon the Mystic Chord harmonized, the grand music halted behind. Nine phoenixes stretched their necks and sang, a hundred dragons held the nectar in their jaws and joined in chorus. Golden essences leapt in melody, eight simurghs soared and danced. Purple banners rose into the sky, brocade pennants wound through the fields. Green canopies arrayed in shade, the winding morning suddenly arose. Flowing bells tossed and turned, their moonlit echoes penetrating. Jasper branches displayed the true, lingering amidst the Five Symbols. Fragrant blossoms scattered mist, petals of the Three Luminaries. Light rosy clouds received the radiance, thin mists girded the light. The reins rang upon the Seven Paths, the Eight Chariots floated in the void. Nine thousand empty carriages, guarded by poisonous dragons. Racing clouds hastened to the mysterious, gathering qi and seizing the wind. The heavens brightened, bursting forth, the Eight Lights hazy and indistinct. The Perfected Woman rode on the right, the Numinous Lad was commanded on the left. In an instant, a thousand myriads arrived at the Upper Palace. Halting the chariot at the Jade Clarity, transcending the Emperor’s ramparts, pacing the Purple Gates, bowing to await announcement.\n\nAfter a long while, the Supreme Great Dao Lord then commanded the Four Ministers of the Dawn Attendant to slowly lead forward, ascending the portal of the Elixir Pearl and entering the inner chamber of the Sevenfold Radiance. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity addressed him by name, saying: \"Your humble servant has now arrived. I beg to hear the Great Mandate.\"\n\nThe Supreme Great Dao Lord replied: \"Li Shanyuan’s virtue aligns with the Seven Sages, and he shall be lord of the Golden Watchtower. Soon he will pay homage to the Ten Heavens, governing the destinies of the multitudes. He shall determine the Middle Prime within the Mystery’s mechanism, regulate yin and yang to harmonize their heads, elevate the perfected and promote the worthy, seal the rivers and summon the seas, decide life and death, grasp the might of heaven, decapitate the Six Heavens, and oversee the punishments of the Three Bureaus. He shall bind the Northern Emperor, and you, Eminent Lord, shall attend his chariot. His Dao is lofty and eminent, his virtue vast and far-reaching. His charge is weighty, and his authority commensurate. I have already instructed him in wisdom, and further recorded for him the *Scripture of Vanquishing Demons*. Wisdom can drive away spirits, and vanquishing demons can extinguish evil. Moreover, I bestow upon him the True Talisman of the Divine Tiger, that he may wield its might to decapitate the Six Heavens. I chant for him the *Lofty Chapter of Commanding Spirits*, to aid him in dispersing filth and banishing calamity.\n\nFurthermore, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity treasures the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger, by which the spirits of heaven and earth are controlled. With a single rebuke, he may shatter and slay a thousand essences; wearing it, he may cause ten thousand ghosts to vanish. All demons that rashly invade shall perish, and every malevolent spirit that gazes upon it shall be struck blind. Should we not together confer this upon Shanyuan, to fulfill his charge?\"\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bowed his head in assent, then untied his cloud-scribed satchel and opened the jade casket. Sevenfold radiance illuminated the plain silk, streaming sunlight revealed the truth, and ninefold brilliance paused in splendor as flying incense intertwined.\n\nBefore the talisman was bestowed, he commanded the attendants of the Grand Tenuity—Ji Linhua, Yan Caiyun, Zhu Tiaoyan, and Han Fangyao—to join in singing the *Poem of the Golden Perfected* and the *Melody of Pacing the Void*. Their verses ran:\n\nThe Supreme Darkness severs the Four Mysteries,\nThe cavern’s scene entrusts divine communion.\nJade terraces spread crimson auroras,\nGreen mists hold golden ramparts.\nAbove, they ladle from the Cloud-Pearl Ridge,\nGazing upward toward the Peak of No Blade.\nThe numinous mirror gleams with purple coils,\nMisty foam radiates into the empty sky.\nMysterious transformations entwine the dark jade,\nLifting the rhythm, they lead the purple youths.\nThe round path has no stagnant veils,\nBrocatelle mists layer upon layer.\nSouthward, they push open the vermilion mound’s gates,\nWestward, they cross the jagged window’s gap.\nTheir forms dance upon ten thousand ripples,\nTheir spirits tread the ten directions.\nThe dark returns to the still axle,\nThe upper resonance rides the celestial dragon.\nMysteriously, they dispel the flying-scene chariot,\nBrandishing bells, they roam the Seven Paths.\nLight and clear, they cross the cloud-dust ford,\nIn an instant, they arrive at the Jade Prefecture.\nOn the left, they grasp the Jade Radiance’s consort,\nOn the right, they command the Golden Perfected’s husband.\nAbove, they join the soaring-aurora worthies,\nBelow, they aid the numinous and wondrous multitudes.\nThey wind through the vast Cold Palace’s halls,\nParting brocade, they enter the divine mounds.\nPhoenix-brain solidifies kalpas,\nFlower-nectar reverses blossoms’ decay.\nThe Supreme feasts in longevity’s harvest,\nDecreeing destinies for the myriad branches’ steps.\nThe Three Awakenings uphold the dark reckoning,\nUnfettered joy gleams in the ivory turn.\nThe whirlwind’s brilliance halts the jade’s splendor,\nHow the purple cassia sways!\nThe forest’s fruit rings through the nine auroras,\nJade staves march toward the Grand Tenuity.\nThe yellow writ restrains the blade of virtue—\nHow rare the radiance of the perfected!\nDiscarding the plain, they enter the formless,\nA hundred images begin to vanish together.\nThe yang’s cinnabar qi’s tip bursts forth,\nResplendent, the crimson clouds take flight.\nIn accord with the Jade Radiance’s stillness,\nDazzling, they hang in the Upper Clarity’s precincts.\nSpirits and numina respond to the dark reckoning,\nFollowing resonance, they summon the world’s omens.\nVast ford’s waves surge in profusion,\nJoining scenes, they mingle with the countenance’s descendants.\nMajestic, the Golden Watchtower’s scion,\nDesolate, he enters the cloud’s verge.\nLooking up and down, the myriad changes shift—\nHe will comply, in harmony with the essence’s pact.\nThe dark perches on the Stillness Terrace,\nClearly chanting wisdom and intelligence.\nVanquishing demons extinguishes ten thousand blades,\nBrandishing verse to expel filth.\nThe Golden Tiger bears heaven’s might,\nSubduing spirits to conceal their qi.\nSweeping away a thousand myriad acres of demons,\nFor ten thousand leagues, no evil speck remains.\n\nThereupon, the great spirits severed blood, the hundred essences lost their sight. The Golden Tiger bared its fangs, spitting might and releasing poison. It seized ghosts without pause, slicing open bellies and severing heads. The Six Heavens bowed together, spirits and numina instantly cowered. Birds and beasts hid their cries, forests and grasses prostrated themselves.\n\nThe Supreme Prime’s marvels were extraordinary, the numinous script luminous and lush. Wearing it and advancing, one may pay court to the Jade Emperor, offering rites in the jeweled chamber where the host of perfected gather.\n\nShould the Divine Tiger’s script be leaked, calamity shall reach the nine clans. Should the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger be divulged, misfortune shall extend to the seven ancestral forebears. Shanyuan, guard it well—you are the flower of the Dao and virtue.\n\nWhen the song concluded, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bestowed upon Lord Li the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger. They swore oaths, expressed gratitude, and each departed.\n\nLord Li, having received the two talismans and heard the Supreme’s discourses on the *Scripture of Wisdom* and the *Scripture of Vanquishing Demons*, then instructed the Azure Lad of the Upper Prime to compile them with the Four Assistants of the Upper Minister into a single text, to be employed regularly and transmitted to those destined to become perfected in the next seven hundred years, permitting three transmissions.\n\nThese verses’ subtle and wondrous sounds mostly comprise the hidden names of heaven, earth, the myriad essences, and the host of spirits, as well as the secret appellations of a thousand demons, poisonous beings, and malevolent spirits. The Supreme chants their names to manifest their transformations, to narrate their affairs, and to seal their talismans.\n\nThe divine radiance surveys the eight vistas, the numinous cavern’s marvels are wondrously arrayed. The secret talismans of might and the demon-vanquishing charms—this Divine Tiger leads their ranks, the Golden Tiger follows in order. Wisdom flourishes within the text, and vanquishing demons is set forth between its lines.\n\nShould one feel fear or dread in the night, merely reciting these two poems will cause a thousand essences to scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand people. When mountains and rivers hear this chant, their spirits shall all wield whips, turning toward the sound to bow in reverence.\n\nHow much more so when wearing the divine gold to illumine the Six Heavens—how could they not gather and submit? If a scholar of the Dao’s resolve travels the Five Peaks, desiring to ascend as an immortal and soar beyond, without the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger bearing the taboo names of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity and the Lord of the Great Unity, his name shall not be recorded in the immortal’s register.\n\nWearing this talisman and reciting the demon-vanquishing scripture, a thousand essences shall scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand people. When mountains and rivers hear this chant, their great spirits shall all wield whips, turning toward the sound to bow in reverence.\n\nIf one wears the taboo names of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity and the characters of the Lord of the Great Unity, one must first present offerings of faith and sincerity to receive the oral instructions from a master. One must not traverse defiled or impure places—this is the secret and wondrous art of the hidden techniques of the Eight Earths. Take great care not to lightly disclose this; transmitting it to the unworthy shall bring calamity for a hundred generations. If the time is not ripe to receive this, fearing its revelation, seal it away in a renowned mountain.\n\n*The Wondrous True Scripture of the Supreme Dao on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons, Scroll Two* ends here.\n\n*The Wondrous True Scripture of the Supreme Dao on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons, Scroll Three*\n\n**Chapter on Guarding the One**\n\nThe Supreme Dao addressed the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal, saying: All mortals of courage and might who follow the precepts and regulations, restrain their minds and bodies, accumulate merit and virtue, and eternally become great sages must do so by guarding the One.\n\nThe One is formless yet capable of response; when response reaches its limit, form arises. Effects follow causes, and the One alternates between existence and non-existence. It is boundless and infinite, without labor or loss, without decrease or increase, without fault or burden, without death or birth. The birthless is eternally born, and the eternally born is deathless. The birth of the deathless gives rise to all things, and all things receive life from this deathless source. The deathless can generate life, creating countless beings. Those who guard it attain wisdom; those who abandon it fall into folly. Folly leads to death, while wisdom preserves life.\n\nLife is precious and desired by all, for all delight in life and detest death. Yet those who seek life fail to live, and those who fear death hasten their demise. Failing to grasp the Dao of life and death, they stray from their aspirations. To not stray from one’s aspirations depends entirely on wisdom. Wisdom first arises from knowing the One. The One generates qi, and qi begets mutual generation. One must neither forget nor neglect it, nor obstruct or suppress it. To suppress qi in pursuit of life severs the generative qi, and severance leads to death, from which there is no return to life. Enduring eternal suffering, the wise awaken to this truth. To awaken late is to be without knowledge. Lack of knowledge plunges one into ignorance, and the ignorant are difficult to transform. Though transformed, they remain unaware; though aware, they do not diligently practice; though diligent, they cannot persist; though persistent, they cannot refine their practice; though refined, they leak and dissipate—this is called lack of resolve. Lack of resolve leads to delusion, and delusion, if uncorrected, is not wisdom. Wisdom is to turn from delusion and enter the Dao, to abandon the perverse and return to the upright.\n\nGuard the generative qi, for qi begets mutual generation. The generative qi transforms and unites, dividing into three: the first is the Primordial Origin, the second is the Originating Cavern, and the third is the Mysterious Void. The lower is the Mysterious Qi, which governs the Void, curing illness and dispelling calamities—one may ride the Void. The middle is the Original Qi, which governs the Cavern, prolonging life and preventing death—one may remove obstacles. The upper is the Primordial Qi, which governs the Origin, ensuring unce\n\nAfterward, inscribe upon gold plates nine inches in length, four inches in breadth, and three *fen* in thickness, and use them to seal the malevolent spirits of mountains and rivers, thereby commanding the true essences of the Five Peaks.\n\nFollowing the ingestion and wearing of the talismans, meditate earnestly upon the Three Ones. Between the eyebrows, one *cun* inward lies the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward, the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward, the Upper Cinnabar Field, also called the Mud-Pill Palace, one *cun* square, where purple *qi* surges to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, nine *cun* in circumference, illuminating ninety thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms—now vast, now minute—swift as a flash, the body forgotten, all held in the mind’s intent.\n\nThe Upper Prime Child resides beneath the canopy of the Mud-Pill Palace, named *Xuan Ning Tian*, styled *San Yuan Xian*, also called *Bo Wu Shang* and *Bo Shi Hua*, and holds the title Lord Emperor of the Mud-Pill Heaven. To his right is the Imperial Minister, named *Zhao Le Jing*, styled *Zhong Xuan*, also called *Qi Fei* and *Chang Fu*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants.\n\nThe heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field, called the Crimson Palace, one *cun* square, where vermilion mist ascends to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, seven *cun* in diameter, illuminating seventy thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms into the Middle Prime Perfected, named *Shen Yun Zhu*, styled *Zi Nan Dan*, also called *Sheng Bo* and *Shi Yun Ju*, and holds the title Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace. To his right is the Assisting Sovereign Minister, named *Zhong Guang Jian*, styled *Si Hua Ling*, also called *You Che Bo* and *Chong Shi Hua*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants, seated facing each other.\n\nThree *cun* below the navel lies the Gate of Destiny, the Cinnabar Field Palace, one *cun* square, where white *qi* surges to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, five *cun* in circumference, illuminating fifty thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms into the Lower Prime Infant, named *Shi Ming Jing*, styled *Yuan Yang Chang*, also called *Ying’er Tai* and *Bo Shi Yuan*, and holds the title Primordial King of the Yellow Court. To his right is the Guardian Stabilizing Minister, named *Gui Shang Ming*, styled *Gu Xia Xuan*, also called *Feng Shen Bo* and *Cheng Guang Sheng*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants, seated facing each other.\n\nBy meditating upon the Three Ones over time, they will manifest. Their manifestation brings divine penetration and the attainment of wisdom. Those who cultivate wisdom yet fail to refine their focus, or whose unity remains unperfected and unmanifest, whose spirits remain unintegrated, will still encounter misfortune. Though matters may be unclear, even if one has grasped the method, life is not yet secure. Those who, knowing themselves, scorn others—what others can achieve, fools dismiss as trivial, paying no heed. With intent unheld, understanding eludes them. Though comprehension may not be essential, it is still employed. Employing it with harmonious light, the foolish find it difficult, the wise find it easy. To abandon it entirely is not the Way, nor is clinging to it. Failing to align with the world, one cannot bring aid—this is not wisdom.\n\nAll arts and skills, games and entertainments, male and female spirits, beauty and ugliness, diverse methods, deeds of body, speech, and mind, sounds and sights, touch and obstruction, movement and stillness, concealment and revelation, transformation and illusion, floating and sinking, existence and nonexistence, authority and substance, orthodoxy and heterodoxy, strength and weakness, ominous words—all actions under heaven—if even one remains unmastered, this is not wisdom.\n\nThose who cultivate wisdom must embrace the One and never depart from it. To depart from the One is to lose wisdom, for all is the work of the Three Pengs. The Upper Peng enslaves the hun and po, and greed and lust bring aging. The Middle Peng enslaves the spirit of consciousness, and anger and resentment bring illness. The Lower Peng enslaves essence and will, and ignorance brings death. Death returns one to the ranks of ghosts, called corpses. The suffering of corpse-ghosts is the work of the Three Pengs, hence their name. Fierce and unruly, they are difficult to subdue. Failing to subdue them, the body’s spirits grow vexed, harmed and broken, sinking into the wind-blades of darkness, enduring torment and agony, a sorrowful eternal night, endless as the kalpas of dust—how can one not fear this?\n\nThe wise first govern the Three Ghosts: restrain greed and lust, avoid entanglement in disputes, suppress anger and resentment, and prevent lawsuits and strife. When strife ceases, disputes end, and punishment does not reach death. Death arises from stagnation, and stagnation from ignorance. Disputes and strife provoke extreme exertion, heedless of retreat, leading to death and calamity. The suffering of calamity is cruel and bitter—regret comes too late.\n\nThus, in cultivation, one must first embrace the One. Embracing the One and preserving the spirit, all affairs flow without stagnation. Acting without acting, daily diminishing to perfect virtue—though greed and lust may briefly arise, one can repent and change. Though anger and resentment may occasionally flare, one can suppress and transform them, ultimately avoiding stagnation. To avoid stagnation is to escape death and attain longevity.\n\nYet fleeting greed and lust are easy to cling to but hard to dispel. Greed for pines may be easy, but lust and anger are far more difficult. All sentient beings wish to prevail. When others impose upon me, the mind cannot bear it. Unable to bear it, one retaliates, and disputes arise. Once arisen, they are hard to halt, leading to death and ruin.\n\nSwear devotion to the Dao, guard the One and never depart. It is easier to refrain from offending others than to prevent others from offending oneself. If offended, do not retaliate; let go of vengeance. If vengeance must be taken, do so with the Dao, offering further enlightenment, dissolving enmity, and entering together into truth. Without harboring resentment, forever united in the source—those who deviate from this path are not wise.\n\nThe wise lead by example, as the Most High knows all below. The refined words form teachings, and the teachings are chanted in seven stanzas, as follows:\n\n1. To know the One yet not guard it, or guard it without firmness, or hold it without constancy—this is not wisdom.\n2. To know the Three yet not govern them, or govern them without strictness, or maintain strictness without permanence—this is not wisdom.\n3. To know peril yet not avoid it, or avoid it without secrecy, or maintain secrecy without constancy—this is not wisdom.\n4. To know words yet not cherish them, or cherish them without encouragement, or encourage without fruition—this is not wisdom.\n5. To know the world can be governed yet not stabilize it, or stabilize it without flourishing—this is not wisdom.\n6. To know the Dao can be practiced yet not clarify it, or clarify it without grandeur—this is not wisdom.\n\n7. To know the absence of knowing yet not refine it, or refine it without precision, or maintain precision without scrutiny—this is not wisdom.\n\nThese seven awakenings are chanted in seven stanzas, forming natural scripture. From the Most High of old to my own self today, and for those who will ascend in the future, all recite this text to dispel demonic trials, extinguish all heretical doubts, remove confusion and banish delusion, return from the peripheral to the fundamental. When the fundamental is firmly established, the peripheral is jointly cultivated. With each diligent effort and each breath, merit and transgression shift. In the cycle of going and returning, encounter and response arise instantly. As soon as there is resonance, there is movement; through movement, the dull and benighted are enlightened. The benighted attain clarity, and clarity returns to true awakening. Awakening perceives all as nothingness, and within nothingness lies the wondrous. The wondrous qi transforms and refines the false into the real. The real arises from the five virtues, and the virtues converge in the six penetrations. The penetrations are sustained by the seven awakenings, and the awakenings are chanted in response to resonance. The resonance manifests as a name, and the name is called \"response.\" Following causes, one enters effects, with verification and evidence, without deviation or error.\n\nWithin the seven and five lies the six, and the six undergo transformations to achieve completion. Even resonance awaits verification; movement is made manifest. Traces arise from my resonance, and I possess the name of resonance. Though names differ, their essence is the same. Verification and manifestation create distinction, distinguishing stillness from movement. The far shore is initially divided: one divides into two, two generates three, and three completes the six. The six forms thirty-six traces, and the thirty-six traces converge in one mind. The source of the mind is fundamentally one, yet its streams are boundless. The great divisions number six, governing emergence and submergence. Practicing this ascends beyond the Three Realms; neglecting it descends into the Nine Dark Abysses. Wisdom and practice of the six enable transcendence beyond the Three Realms and deliverance from the suffering of the Nine Abysses—hence the name \"Six Perfections.\" The thirty-six heavens of the six sixes all cultivate the Six Perfections:\n\n1. **Diligence**: Practicing goodness without slackening.\n2. **Faith**: Devoted to the Dao without forgetfulness.\n3. **Yielding**: Guarding the One with softness.\n4. **Perseverance**: Maintaining the beginning without failure.\n5. **Admonition**: Halting evil without resistance, preserving both self and others.\n6. **Renunciation**: Abandoning wine and lust, harmonizing light to commune with spirits, blending with the world to plant the Dao, free from confusion and stagnation—this is wisdom.\n\nThis wisdom is ever clear and luminous. Even when offering libations, one remains undimmed, neither benighted nor stagnant, communing with spirits and aiding the multitude. It binds to the Dao and cultivates humanity, present yet not disordered—hence the name \"renunciation.\" Renunciation lies in non-stagnation; stagnation lies in violating precepts. Violating precepts leads to confusion—this is not wisdom.\n\nFor those who study and practice, preserving the spirit and revering virtue, though not yet free from dependence, they cultivate frugality to demonstrate integrity. They honor daily diminution, manifest integrity to the spirit, offer sustenance to the worthy and virtuous, express utmost sincerity, and adhere to the laws and regulations—without excess.\n\nWine is the essence of grains and water, capable of circulating qi and fluids. Moderation in it connects with the numinous and benefits nature; indulgence in it disrupts the spirit and harms life. Surrendering to intoxication leads to oblivion—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe source is naturally one; the mysterious two forms images. The two qi flow and moisten, harmonizing into three threes. The three ones circulate universally, and the sages share the same year. Overflowing virtue fills all, and the two halves generate life. The two halves become one, and each one is boundless. Abandoning virtue for lust, neglecting the cultivation of humanity, indulging desires and following passions—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe flow of wisdom knows the sun’s decline and the moon’s waning. The august spirits revere it, prioritizing the generation of life. From self-cultivation to benefiting others, transmission and transformation never cease. Take care not to deviate from this.\n\nWhen the two qi lose harmony, either yin congeals with yin or yang entangles with yang. Men may gather excessively with women, or women may cluster around men. Noble and base intermingle, Daoists and laypeople jostle in confusion. Jealousy, resentment, and anger arise, leading to isolation and exaltation. This severs lineage and extinguishes descendants, causing downfall into barrenness. The hope of return remains distant, and regret comes too late.\n\nSome men indulge in beautiful women, and women cling to handsome men. Their unions are not with wives or concubines, nor with husbands or betrothed. Licentiousness disrupts propriety, and life and death deviate from the real. Failing to awaken and reform—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom is clear and luminous, neither deviant nor disordered. Thus, one ascends to the Three Clarities, the Purple Pole of the Jade Capital. The source of the ultimate Dao is reached through purity.\n\nAll beings containing qi are without ability or desire. Desires vary in depth, and matters differ in weight. Light transgressions involve contact; if unchecked, they become grave.\n\nIf one does not offend others, yet others offend, one must endure. Enduring with resentment and words unrelieved—this is not wisdom.\n\nWhen superiors and inferiors, inner and outer circles, transgress against one another, respond with a kind countenance and joyful demeanor. Use analogies and explanations, weeping and sorrow, scolding and threats—employ every expedient to halt the offense. Consider the provisional and the real, now guiding, now restraining. Avoid provoking anger, lest minor matters escalate. If the offense persists, it is due to deep karmic evil, unknown even to the sages. Compassionately refrain from blame, silently ashamed of being unable to stop it.\n\nTake care not to speak recklessly and expose the spirit. Wisdom may find itself powerless—this is such a case. Yet do not excessively shame or resent, abandoning the other without further regard. Nor should one fail to guard against failure, allowing others to act unchecked without compassionate aid—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom guards stillness and preserves the spirit, forgetting form and stabilizing qi. Qi flows without contention, and contention can be halted. Forgetting form while preserving the spirit allows admonitions to be heeded. But if one forgets the spirit while preserving form, seeking personal gain at others’ expense, others will not trust or follow. Instead, resentment grows, and calamity arises later—this is not wisdom.\n\nFor all undertakings, the beginning lies in the Dao. All other matters are coarse and peripheral. The peripheral may be abandoned, but the wondrous beginning must not be forsaken. Forsaking the wondrous to pursue the coarse—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom arises in the mind, moves the mouth, and stirs the body. Practicing the Dao is the beginning; a good beginning ensures a good end. The end does not deviate from the beginning. Refining the mind daily, good conduct advances, and merit and virtue are ever renewed. Those unable to do so—this is not wisdom.\n\nIn establishing body and mind, align the mouth with thoughts of the Dao. Embrace the One to unify the myriad, practice weakness and honor softness. The rivers and seas contain much, thus they are lords of streams. Those who endure humiliation receive filth and become masters. Unable to bear hardship, discern right from wrong, or endure affliction—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe wise discern no duality of destruction; self and other are one, right and wrong need not be debated, and if debated, one does not cling obstinately. Suffering and joy require no distinction, and if distinguished, no need to expound. In doing good, one does not boast; when slandered, one does not defend. Those whose minds differ from this are not wise.\n\nAll life receives life, and the living are most precious. To honor the Dao and revere the scriptures, to esteem the master—these form the Three Treasures, treasures of true and priceless worth. The Three must not be partial; partiality leads to stagnation, while completeness brings perfect harmony. Harmony enables salvation of the many, and the salvation of the many arises from the Three Honored Ones. The honored body becomes one, and the one responds to the three with resonance—now hidden, now manifest, now silent, now speaking, now interacting, now discoursing.\n\nThe Dao-Treasure is formless, hidden as the root of transformation. The scriptures bear written words, manifest as the beginning of teaching. The master has form and speech, whose comings and goings constitute the Dharma. Speech and silence follow the moment, but enduring presence is supreme.\n\nThe most essential teaching delivers countless beings. Reverently believe in the Three Treasures, cherish them steadfastly without forgetfulness. Through fasting and ritual, summon the spirits; uphold precepts and practice the Dao. Be cautious and unblemished, whole and unbroken. If broken or blemished, repent past transgressions and cultivate the future. Those who do not repeat their faults will surely attain deliverance. Those who do not believe, do not uphold, do not reform, do not repent—cannot attain deliverance and are not wise.\n\nUpon hearing the Great Dao, vow to practice diligently without cease, doing good without rest, diminishing the self to aid others. Those with literary or martial talent share their understanding with others. Those with courage and strength offer their labor to others. Those with power, rank, or wealth bestow honor and bounty upon others. Those lacking these three offer the goodness of their hearts to others—rejoicing when they see others’ good deeds and assisting them, grieving when they see others shun their duties and aiding them in sorrow. Though no immediate benefit may come to them, over time, resonance will arise. When others receive the blessings of praise and support, they themselves gain the reward of a joyful heart. This reward is like almsgiving, ever increasing without depletion. Thus, naturally, one acquires talent, strength, power, and rank.\n\nThose who lack these four offerings are not wise. The wise practice these four as the foundation of the Six Perfections. To study emptiness yet not be empty is the ultimate attainment of the sage. The ultimate is not empty emptiness; not empty, not empty—emptiness is utterly void. There is no \"having,\" yet \"having\" does not persist. There is no \"non-having,\" yet \"non-having\" is not absolute. \"Non-having\" transcends refinement and coarseness; \"having\" entails good and evil. Good and evil arise from \"having\" and \"non-having,\" which in turn give rise to one another. Refinement and coarseness take shape in contrast, yet one cannot fathom their ultimate nature—this is not wisdom.\n\nLucid and pure, radiant yet not dazzling, active when needed, withdrawn when appropriate—ordinary minds cannot fathom this. Rectify the mind and govern the body, restrain the mouth and guard stillness. The three karmas do not transgress; the Dao is fulfilled and the spirit complete. Floating and sinking at will, soaring with the six penetrations—this is called the Brahmanic practice, loftier than the mundane, ascending from earth to heaven. The Six Perfections crown the Brahmanic practice; the Seven Awakenings ascend to the Great Web. Neither lesser sages nor middling perfected ones can approach this, nor can the next rank of immortals and worthies attain it.\n\nAs for those of petty wisdom and great delusion, petty kindness and great confusion—clinging to non-being while grasping at being, harming one another—when the demonic comes to test them, they neither cross over nor awaken, thus falling into retrogression. This is not wisdom.\n\nThe wise and worthy advance with diligence, their merit and virtue surpassing all. They too may ascend to union, and in union, demons vanish. One must be resolute and courageous, attaining realization in a future life before the present one. O disciples, heed this!\n\nThe Golden Portal Emperor bows his head and reverently practices.\n\n*Thus concludes the third scroll of* The Supreme Cavern-Real One’s Scripture on Wisdom Dispelling Demons.\n\n*The Supreme Cavern-Real One’s Scripture on Wisdom Dispelling Demons, Scroll Four: \"Attaining Sagehood\"*\n\nThe Most High addressed the Azure Lad:\n\n\"The host of sages accumulate merit, and through karmic conditions attain fruition. When fruition reaches its apex and realization is complete, their wondrous forms transcend all comparison. Having delivered the thirty-six heavens, they thus possess the thirty-six marks. Having perfected the eighty-one grades, they thus possess the eighty-one excellences. Great perceptions all behold their full manifestation, while lesser perceptions receive partial responses—each appearing in greater or lesser measure, with the lesser concealing the greater. The common folk cannot perceive this.\n\nThus, the true bodies of the host of sages are without fixed form, yet their essential nature is constant, neither increasing nor diminishing. Few know this, and so it is uniquely prized. Yet for those who set their minds on learning, though their penetrating insight may not yet be complete, what they do perceive reveals wonders according to their understanding. Those who recognize the eyes and brows behold their eyes and brows as extraordinary; those who discern the nose and mouth perceive their nose and mouth as surpassing all. Thus, for each of the thirty-six marks, perception follows the clarity of one’s knowledge. When clarity reaches its apex and knowledge becomes all-encompassing, full illumination is attained.\n\nAll beings that contain qi share this principle, differing only in degree—some in abundance beyond measure, others in the barest minimum, even to the point of one. Yet even one remains unattainable, for this shared path is distant. Only through cultivation and refinement can one proceed. Refining the many returns them to the few; yet before the few are reduced to one, there remain thirty-six stages, each corresponding to a heaven. Each stage possesses a great distinction, and when these distinctions are unified, they reach the apex of the heavens. The apex of the thirty-six heavens converges in a single source.\n\nThus, the methods of convergence vary, each establishing its own teachings and techniques. The paths of the Dharma diverge, sometimes aligning, sometimes differing. The root of these differences lies in goodness. From one root, a single branch responds, forming the thirty-six. The three qi and three realms are all contained within. Form extends beyond, and beyond form, words are forgotten. Those who attain this in the thirty-six heavens—each of the thirty-six heavens possesses one—gain the most surpassing marks, which the Most High fully embodies.\n\nThe celestial beings of the heavens, the perfected, the immortals, the sages, and the divine—each possesses these marks in greater or lesser measure. Among worldly people, from emperors and kings to dukes and nobles, down to the common folk, each also possesses them in varying degrees. Some enjoy wealth and nobility yet die young; others live in poverty and lowliness yet attain long life. Some lack homes and dwellings yet have masters and lords; others possess palaces and mansions yet lack resources. Some amass treasures yet do not adorn themselves with robes and crowns; others indulge in fine food and adornment yet do not build houses. Some dwell beneath trees or in thatched huts yet gain fame and renown; others reside in splendid halls and fragrant gardens yet spread their fragrance far and wide. Some live in jade towers yet lack the Dao; others dwell in stone huts yet possess virtue. The threads of these variations are countless, their outcomes manifold.\n\nThe superior may engage in inferior affairs, while the inferior may pursue superior endeavors. Karmic conditions differ, and cultivation takes many forms. One must not disparage others, for disparagement harms perception. When the spirit of perception is fully awakened, it resides in the five virtues. When the five virtues are complete, all traces may be forgotten. Forgetting the traces, the traces remain—naturally manifesting the marks of excellence. When the thirty-six are fully possessed, one gains nobility, wealth, talent, and wisdom, along with majesty, radiance, and brilliance that surpass all others. Palaces and cities, jeweled canopies and bed curtains, fragrant flowers and music, attendants and guards, civil and martial aides, banners and drums—all resound in grandeur. Wind and clouds harmonize, movement and stillness align. The blazing light of the sun and moon, robes and crowns of myriad hues, a hundred harmonious flavors—body and speech abound in abundance. Whether needed or not, all is at ease and free. The supreme perfected and the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One, through accumulating learning and practicing goodness, ultimately attain this. Those who have not yet attained this remain bound to the turning wheel of birth and death, where suffering and joy, existence and non-existence alternate. If perception cannot penetrate this, stagnation leads to disorder, and disorder leads to falling into evil, with no return in sight. Only by turning toward goodness can one find the way back.\n\nNow, let those who study examine themselves closely: what do they possess, and what do they lack? Seek what is lacking, and do not cling to what is already possessed. Those who can provide for others will naturally attain what they lack. For those who have wealth but lack talent and understanding, it is fitting to practice generosity without stinginess, valuing the Dao over material goods. Their talent and understanding will then renew daily. For those who have dwellings but lack peace and well-being, it is fitting to welcome the worthy and the sagely, offering their homes to true immortals, without regret or attachment. Sorrows and troubles will then naturally dissolve. For those who have clothing and food but lack long life, it is fitting to reduce bodily comforts and share with enlightened teachers, seeking rare methods and practicing wondrous arts without slackening. They will surely secure extended life. For those who possess talent and wisdom but lack shelter and provisions, it is fitting to cultivate inner vision and secretly transform future lives, guiding all beings without claiming merit. Humility and concealment, without doubt in the heart, will draw the protection of divine spirits and the reverence of humans and ghosts. They will naturally gain vast dwellings, heavenly palaces, and blessed halls, with extraordinary clothing and food, and attendants adorned in splendor.\n\nMatters such as these can be extended to all things, each manifesting in its own way, and need not be exhaustively recorded. The enlightened grasp this: abandoning the existent to seek the non-existent, one need not necessarily attain the non-existent. Attaining the non-existent lies in non-stagnation, and non-stagnation lies in non-attachment. To give when sought is to be without fixation—this is non-stagnation, not abandonment. Though one may not seek, if attachment to possession causes distress, discarding it for others is called abandonment, not non-stagnation. To abandon this for that is to stagnate in the non-existence of this—this is not the Dao. To give when sought, though I do not cling, may bring calamity to the recipient—this is coarse non-stagnation, also not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao does not stagnate in subtlety. Subtlety lies in illumination. My abandonment causes no loss, while the recipient gains benefit—this is the Dao, the way of the wise. In giving, there are many ways—what is fitting and what is not. To give fittingly is wisdom; to give unfittingly is folly. Folly lies in giving that contradicts wisdom.\n\nWhen others come seeking from me, I weigh the truth or falsity of their request. If false, they test me; if true, they rely on me. Those who rely may be good or evil; those who test may be coarse or refined. Coarse tests are to be shattered and destroyed; refined tests are to be declined with courtesy. To decline with courtesy is the way of the sagely teacher.\n\nWhen good spirits test me with affairs, if I lack wondrous virtue, if my virtue is not yet complete, they come to test me now. With keen perception and clear intent, I already know and understand, free from confusion. Thus, I decline with this—this is wisdom.\"\n\nTo shatter them is to confront the Five Demons and Three Poisons, who test through transformations. When my arts remain obscure and my power untrusted, I govern them—punishing, reproving, and subduing—until they submit. To vanquish demonic adversaries is wisdom.\n\nThose who falter in testing, seized by terror, hesitation, or confusion, fail to transcend—such are not the wise. Those unwise may fall into demonic factions, yet if they awaken to the snares of the perverse and extricate themselves, returning from deviation to rectitude, steadfast in resolve without retreat—neither rejoicing in praise nor grieving at slander—dissolving ills with method, dispelling them with principle, and setting aside censure and acclaim without concern, they cultivate the true Dao, their virtue unflagging. When slander naturally subsides, this is wisdom.\n\nWhen others assail with offense, do not reckon or retaliate. Speak rightly when words are fitting; otherwise, remain silent. Inwardly discern the spirit’s path, silently relinquishing the impulse to strike back. When assaults cease of themselves, harbor no thought of requital—such a mind, free of vengeance, sees virtue daily ascend.\n\nThough evil men despise them, they cannot inflict harm; instead, the harm rebounds upon themselves. One pities their folly, lamenting that their malice finds no outlet. Such a heart is wisdom.\n\nAll violent men—rebellious and lawless—may interrogate the Dao, mock virtue, revile heaven and earth, defame parents, slander masters and lords, envy kin and friends, or slander the good. Yet to endure, suffer wrong without anger, persist in explanation without contention, and hold the Dao steadfast in the heart—this is wisdom.\n\nTo rage in self-justification, redress wrongs at others’ expense, seek fame through death, or indulge wrath without regard for life, dying unrepentant or deepening karmic entanglements—this is not wisdom.\n\nAgainst all evil men, fierce birds, venomous beasts, stinging insects, and poisonous creatures, one must guard. Without skill in defense, or with shallow arts that fail to repel, if past enmity runs deep while present merit is slight, retribution will surely come. Yet when it arrives, do not abandon the Dao. Know it as the fruition of past sins, and bear no resentment. Today’s suffering is the reckoning of old debts. Dissolve the causes and conditions without malice, even when violence is inflicted.\n\nAt first, their intent—light or grave—remains unclear. Employ methods: persuasion, incantations, vows, and varied explanations, striving to prevent mutual harm. Even if forced to wield blades or threats to drive them away, never kill or harm, lest enmity deepen. When all arts fail to repel, accept partial ruin to settle past debts, without harboring thoughts of retaliation. Preserve the Dao, seeking future liberation—this is wisdom.\n\nThose sharp yet impoverished, dull yet prosperous, kind yet short-lived, deceitful yet long-lived, innocent yet afflicted, guilty yet at ease—all receive precise karmic retribution, without the slightest deviation. The perceptive understand; the benighted doubt. Doubt cannot be dispelled, nor can understanding be sought—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe wise harbor no doubt; the doubtless possess insight. They discern the thirty-six heavens and earths, master the thirty-six sublime practices, and intone the thirty-six true tones—thus, all demons vanish.\n\nThe Three Corpses are most malevolent, known as the Three Poisons, which harm human life. They must be swiftly eradicated. By guarding the One with single-minded devotion, the Three Corpses self-destruct.\n\nThe One has no form, no desire, no action. Hard to attain, easy to lose—loss stems from dim perception, inability to advance in clarity, and the heart’s entanglement in craving. Thus, decline and aging arise. Joy and anger invite illness; delusion, if uncorrected, brings death. Anger and aging are prolonged by the Three Corpses.\n\nTo heal, preserve, and protect, first guard the One. Without the One, nothing succeeds; without the One, nothing is achieved. Guard the One in tranquility, the mind serene and seeking, curbing desire and restraining power. Turn from delusion to truth, vast and desireless, uniting with the One—this is the highest of the high, achieved through lifelong accumulation.\n\nThose of middling rank and above, though their goodness is not yet perfected, ascend gradually. They must attend to the Three Origins, discerning the spirit and qi, their forms, names, and movements—presence and absence, governing the Three Palaces. Thus, the Three Corpses fall away. The Three Origins are wondrous, yet not instantly mastered. Cultivate goodness diligently, perfect the Five Virtues, accumulate myriad merits daily. Then, a thousand demons dare not assail. With the Corpses’ poisons gone, darkness refines into light. Wisdom and spiritual penetration arise, bestowing immortality.\n\nThe sacred and true immortals reap the fruits of their causes, ascending the mysterious and transforming the world, following the cycles of departure and return. They measure others by measuring themselves, observing body and all things—all bearing verification. Examine closely: correct errors, uphold what is right. Through fasting, stillness, contemplation, ingesting herbs and talismans, reciting petitions and vows, doubt yields to certainty. Free from greed and desire, they neither decline nor age. The aged revert to youth, body and spirit radiant. Free from joy and anger, they know no illness or misfortune. Misfortune is overcome, illness cured, qi strong and flourishing. Free from delusion and envy, they neither die nor perish. Though seeming to perish, they do not. With right vision and no deviation, they commune with others and unite with the Dao. The One merges with the One—thus are they called sacred and true immortals.\n\nIf desires cannot be diminished, decline cannot be averted, anger cannot be dispelled, illness cannot be cured, folly cannot be transformed, or death cannot be escaped—mere claims of Dao cultivation are false and vain. Such vain pretenders ultimately fall into demonic factions, causing worldly illusions to arise: false names, pretenses of being the Most High or sacred immortals, feigned divine transformations to delude all. Without true learning, who can rectify this?\n\nTo transform the perverse and preserve the true, guard the One and illuminate the Three. Practice the Five and perfect the Six—those of the Six Penetrations harbor no falsity. In movement and stillness, all is real. Though employing expedient transformations, they ultimately rely on the true Dao.\n\nThe work of the true Dao knows no sorrow or illness, no death—only eternal life. Teaching tirelessly, they master ancient and modern texts at a glance, discerning truth from falsehood, weighing subtleties, exposing flaws and errors, clarifying ambiguities. Their explanations are settled and lucid, resolving doubts. Applying scriptures yields solemn verification. Their speech is flawless, their writings unburdened. Their pure discourse moves heaven; their compositions outshine the sun. Pen in hand, they compose chapters, extolling the profound. Whether scriptures, commentaries, precepts, or disciplines—whether admonitions, odes, contracts, memorials, petitions, or decrees—whether chapters, petitions, confessions, or vows—whether formulas, talismans, records, or registers—whether few or many, elaborate or simple, plain or ornate, refined or unadorned, shallow or deep—they adapt teachings to circumstances. Their conduct varies, their appearances differ, their concealments and revelations diverge.\n\nSome first diverge then later converge, some initially align then later part; departing from evil and uniting with goodness—goodness is the foundation of the Dao. When utterances are set into writing, there are separations and exchanges, excesses and advantages, each fitting its truth with aptness.\n\nThose of single penetration cannot refine a hundred characters; those of double penetration leave a thousand words unaltered; those of triple penetration find ten thousand characters not obscure; those of quadruple penetration see a hundred thousand as unchanging; those of quintuple penetration regard a million as unbound; those of sextuple penetration mark a thousand million without blemish. Beyond these, responses to change are inexhaustible.\n\nWithout these six kinds of people, one cannot engage in composition. Only they may compile and transmit, emulating the ancients. All must be verified by citation, following the counsels of former sages. Take care not to rely on one’s own breast and speak from mere opinion. Though one may speak from the heart, if the heart has not attained thorough penetration, it does not enter the true Dharma. All such are called heterodox writings, which soon perish of themselves and do not long circulate. Only those six kinds of people ensure endless dissemination, whether hidden or revealed, never to be extinguished.\n\nLater learners, diligently study this principle. If you have not yet equaled the six, do not force yourself to write. In vain you will labor heart and mind, mocked by men and spirits, offending the numinous powers. Then you will suffer severe torment, the wind-knife’s agonizing pain enduring for kalpas without relief.\n\nDo not pursue empty fame or lightly compose in reckless abandon. Reckless composition brings misfortune—clearly recognize this and be cautious.\n\nAll acts, whether beneficial or not, whether advantageous or not—acting or non-acting, acting yet not for oneself, oneself acting yet not for oneself, oneself acting for things, acting for the sake of things, acting yet not acting, non-acting yet acting, acting as non-acting—\n\nFor those who act as non-acting, resentment and slander do not arise. If they arise, they do not harm oneself. The other brings calamity upon themselves; calamity befalls them. Pity them, grieve for them, think of them and aid them. Do not indulge, yet do not restrain; do not restrain, yet do not indulge. Rescue them with every means. If means cannot save them, if salvation is beyond their capacity—this remains perpetually fortunate, while they sink into misfortune. Their misfortune is not yours; your fortune is not sought, yet comes of itself. Self-arriving is not misfortune—it is natural good fortune. Those who do not know this good fortune are not wise.\n\nIf others are angry with me and I am angry in return, even if I do not retaliate, yet fail to guard against it, I sit by while their transgression deepens, bringing grave disaster upon myself. Grave disaster follows unnoticed; blindly trusting in one’s own conduct, calamity spreads unpredictably. Unable to avoid it—this is not wisdom.\n\nOne who can teach others must first be capable oneself. Teaching others brings benefit; benefiting oneself and others, do not benefit where there is no benefit. Benefit without benefit is called harm; harming the false benefits the true.\n\nThe true person teaches others without selfishly keeping goodness for oneself. One’s own goodness is the goodness of others; the goodness of oneself and others is the same. Refining goodness leads to truth; accomplishing the true Dao, slander and humiliation do not come. If they come, they cause no harm. There is no doubt in judgment—doubt is not wisdom.\n\nWhen slanderous rumors spread, do not retaliate or overturn. Explain with skillful means, pleasing without anger. Both parties rejoice, doubts and reproaches disperse like clouds. Following one’s nature and insisting on being right, disregarding others’ concerns—though one may meet the mark, one cannot embrace the vast. Partial beauty bears injury—this is not wisdom.\n\nThose without wisdom are daily tested by demons, with no way to obtain the thirty-six divine mushrooms, no means to bear the thirty-six marks of fruition, unable to manifest the eighty-one excellences. They cannot dissolve the multitude of demons; their spiritual power remains incomplete. They must not presumptuously ascend the Dao altar. Ascending the Dao dissolves demons—first, wisdom must be established.\n\nThe Azure Youth bows his head, receives, and pledges to practice.\n\n*Wondrous True Supreme Speaks the Scripture on Wisdom Dissolving Demons, Scroll Four concludes*\n\n*Wondrous True Supreme Speaks the Scripture on Wisdom Dissolving Demons, Scroll Five*\n*Chapter on Transformations*\n\nThe Supreme addressed the Lord of the Golden Portal: \"Of the countless multitudes, every feeling elicits a response. Evil is originally present, existing yet not at its extreme. Though there may be slight goodness, it is not wondrous goodness. Thinking of evil, evil responds—originally present, they incline toward one another.\n\nGoodness is originally absent, non-existent yet not yet arisen. Abandoning that coarse evil, one thinks of this wondrous goodness. Wondrous goodness responds to goodness—originally absent, now arising.\n\nOriginal absence is the Dao; the Dao responds only to goodness. Goodness has great and small, yet none is evil. Original presence is the mundane; the mundane responds only to evil. Evil has great and small, yet none is good.\n\nThus, for those who do evil, though the Dao seeks to save them, the deeply deluded do not turn back. Not turning back, they fall into evil—beyond what wisdom can do. For those who do good, though the mundane may attack them, the steadfast and upright do not waver. Not wavering, they accomplish goodness—this is what wisdom can cultivate and establish.\n\nCultivation and establishment begin with the One. The One generates yin and yang. Supreme harmony spreads qi, containing essence and nurturing spirit. Spirit and qi are most wondrous, without beginning or end, without bounds or shores, without top or bottom, without center or interval, without place yet not nothing.\n\nWhere there is place, all exists, yet existence cannot know it. Those who know possess wisdom—the people of the Supreme.\n\nThe people of the Supreme embody this wondrous wisdom, clearly guarding the One. Their application does not overflow. Profound and still, they are the ancestral host; their traces respond according to their portion. Depending on what is received, there are greater and lesser wisdoms.\n\nWhy is this so? Wisdom is an external name; wondrous qi is the inner reality. Reality does not depart from the nameless; names are provisional combinations. Gathering the branches to return to the root, drawing the false back to the true—the true within has no false; responses without may depart, then return again.\n\nNames have egress and ingress. Inwardly, they are the heart-spirit; outwardly, they are conduct and deeds. Deeds have regulations and laws, scriptural teachings and written words. Following and disseminating them, applying them with reliance on a teacher—beginning and end without deficiency—this is called merit and virtue.\n\nMerit and virtue are accomplished through the five spirits: the liver’s hun-soul, the lungs’ po-soul, the spleen’s intent, the kidneys’ essence, and the heart’s spirit. These mutually require one another, clearly understanding without opposition. Harmonizing and aligning in sequence, the Three Ones remain.\n\nRetaining the One unifies the five; the six penetrations reside in the body. Body and spirit are both one, entering the gate of non-duality. The heart is the master of conduct; conduct returns to the heart-spirit. Spirit and penetration are non-dual, embracing the One without departure.\"\n\nThe One pervades the cavernous void; in the void’s expanse, there is no limit. Nothing is not contained; nothing is not possessed. Within, it is truly nameless; without, it is called wisdom.\n\nWisdom marks the source and gathers the currents. The wise know the return; the enlightened are without delusion. Without delusion, one enters samādhi. Response and resonance leave nothing unanswered; the slightest good is surely aided, merit is surely assisted, virtue is surely flourishing, cause is surely followed by effect. This effect enters samādhi, transforming and adapting as is fitting.\n\nTo know samādhi yet not abide in it, to comprehend the Dharma yet not cultivate it—cultivating without verification, exhausting effort without attainment—mere words without substance: this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom establishes virtue and merit, follows methods and applies techniques, is meticulous and precise, preserves the Dao and relies on the scriptures, seeks verification from a teacher. Though long without sign, one redoubles devotion, practices without ceasing, and naturally achieves success.\n\nThough methods and arts are many, the essential lies in but a little: first, preserve the Dao and guard the One. The One Dao, the One heart—let the heart hold no dual thought. Present conduct is without flaw. Ingesting talismans, reciting incantations, counting breaths, pacing steps—what is cultivated with single-mindedness will surely be verified.\n\nYet verification does not endure, for precision is lacking. Refine it further, refine it again—within it lies certainty. The decisive certainty is as follows; guard it closely and do not recklessly disclose it.\n\nThe wise superior adept practices these Three Guards, dispelling demonic adversaries, vanquishing ghostly thieves, subduing evil persons, warding off baleful qi, dispelling sorrow and curing illness, protecting against warfare. Water and fire cannot encroach; myriad calamities cannot assail. One roams beyond the Three Realms, feasts in the palace of the Queen Mother, meets in succession the sovereigns of Great Peace, and has one’s name entered in the register of the Seed People. Ascending as an immortal, one attains the highest rank of the imperial hierarchy, forever uniting with the Dao, transformations without end—such is the wondrous efficacy of wisdom, the essential secret of all sages.\n\nThe Golden Portal’s Holy Emperor bows his head and reverently practices.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of Supreme Purity on Wisdom’s Dispelling of Demons.",

      "translated_text": "**The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*\nAuthor unknown, originating in the late Northern and Southern Dynasties. Originally in seven scrolls, now extant in five scrolls and five sections.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, First Section.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One of *The Wondrous Cavern Supreme: The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons***\n**Section: The True Elixir, Mysterious Radiance, Lofty Numinosity**\n\nAt that time, the Most High Dao Lord expounded the *Preface to the Mysterious Radiance of the True Elixir from the Great Wisdom Texts of the Supreme Clarity for Dispelling Demons*. The Golden Portal Emperor, who had attended the discourse, later reported it to the Azure Lad, saying: “This is what is spoken of in the *Supreme Clarity Scripture on Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*. It can expel evil and cure illness, drive away spirits and remove harm, disperse the demonic *qi* of the Six Heavens, and subdue the incursions of the myriad specters. To recite this chapter is to wield the divine tiger’s branches and stems, employing the true *qi* in secret practice.”\n\nThose of the highest rank may transmit it to Daoist adepts whose predestined true names were established before their studies. If, before their training, they were assailed by demonic hordes, or if, while dwelling in their chambers, they were afflicted by ghostly maladies—should they recite it by day in their rooms and [meditate upon it] by night in their hearts, then the hundred evils will retreat afar, and their spirits will open and their minds become luminous.\n\nThe Azure Lad received the teachings with reverence and recorded them in the *Divine Talismans*.\n\nThe elixirs of the Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and Great Ultimate are sufficient to repel the hundred ghosts—how much more so when one ingests their substances?\n\nThe immortals of the Nine Palaces have never beheld the chapters of this scripture, nor have the perfected of the Great Ultimate transmitted the great scripture of wisdom.\n\nThis scripture is bestowed upon disciples who comprehend emptiness; it is not conferred upon those whose true names remain upon the earth. Only when one has attained the Dao and ascended to the Great Ultimate may it be transmitted to those worthy of receiving it.\n\nWhat the Most High has now expounded is but a single word among ten thousand from the *Scripture of Wisdom*—though one’s true name may exist upon the earth, if one has not yet departed to study the Dao, there is no karmic affinity to hear it in full. Thus, this scripture cannot be fully revealed.\n\nTo hear its opening title is to know the name of its elixir—it is the Jade Scripture of Supreme Clarity for those with true destiny.\n\nThe Azure Lad received the teachings with reverence and later transmitted them to Master Red Pine.\n\nBefore Master Red Pine attained the Dao, he fell gravely ill in the Golden Flower Mountains, suffering for sixteen years. Though he meditated upon the true and preserved his essence, his afflictions did not abate. During this time, he calmed his heart and sought the Dao, refining his spirit and guarding stillness. He did not grieve over his suffering nor regard life and death as matters of concern.\n\nFor the numinous ghosts of the Six Heavens disrupt the true with illness, or celestial beings may instruct demons to induce sickness—all to test the resolve of the heart, to observe whether one treads the path of water and fire with rectitude or deviation. Such is the trial of illness.\n\nMaster Red Pine, while fasting and convalescing, recited the *Scripture of Wisdom* and intoned the *Dispelling Demons* section three thousand times. Thereupon, his ailments were entirely cured, his mind opened, and his spirit became luminous—surpassing even his state before illness.\n\nIllness serves four purposes: first, to test the sincerity of the heart; second, to purge the impurities of the lower corpse; third, to eliminate unrighteousness; and fourth, to refine worldly defilements.\n\nIf one steadfastly aligns the heart, strengthens resolve, seeks the Dao, and guards the spirit, yearning for the mysterious teachings, then illness may dissipate in an instant. But if one is deluded by sickness and allows the heart to waver, if one’s devotion is unsteady and the will wanders, if one’s sincerity is half-hearted, then illness may persist until dawn.\n\nLater, Master Red Pine attained the Dao in the Great Mount Huo, ascended to the Golden Portal, and received the scriptures as the Perfected of the Great Void—his true name having long been recorded in Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Scripture of Wisdom* is also called the *Great Simplicity Cavern Scripture* or the *Transmission of Pristine Wisdom*. It comprises seven scrolls, stored within the Jade Clarity’s portal, in the chambers of the Lofty Void Sovereign’s cinnabar abode.\n\nThree thousand jade maidens of pristine numinosity are ever in attendance upon these seven scrolls, whence it is also titled the *Great Simplicity Cavern Scripture*.\n\nThe wise recognize the August Emperor of the Sun’s zenith; the enlightened regard the urgency of ceaseless generation. The character for “wisdom” (*hui*) contains two “life” (*sheng*) radicals side by side, both riding upon the sign of “urgency.”\n\nThose with cultivated intent follow the words of the *Scripture of Wisdom*; those without it heed the dual teachings of the Most High Dao Lord.\n\nOne must recite them in sequence to completion, totaling three thousand repetitions. If the count is incomplete and one pauses, one must begin anew from the first repetition.\n\nDuring prolonged fasting in a purified chamber, after reciting with focused mind, one must sever all external distractions. One must not pause midway, for to do so invites tribulation upon the body. The jade lads will report to the Three Offices, and the matter will be memorialized to the Golden Portal—this must not be taken lightly.\n\nThose who study the Dao must recite it to completion, for it dispels evil, illuminates the spirit, opens the mind, scatters ignorance, eliminates specters, harmonizes *qi*, and infuses the body with true essence.\n\nFirst, fast for fifty days, then begin recitation. Cup the hands in reverence, utter the words clearly, neither hastily nor carelessly.\n\nAfter mastering it, one will grasp its wonders, and numinous beings may descend to impart understanding. One who comprehends its purport may also soar through the Great Void—such is the Perfected of the Great Void. Ten thousand recitations are most excellent. On the day the practice is complete, the cloud chariot will arrive.\n\nThis Dao surpasses the thirty-nine sections of the *Cavern Scriptures*, yet what is received is but a ten-thousandth part of the *Scripture of Wisdom*—how much more vast is the profound garden of its seven scrolls!\n\nHowever, the statutes and methods of the Four Poles may not be transmitted to perfected ones who have not yet ascended to heaven from the earthly realm.\n\nOn days of fasting and purification, it is best to recite this scroll in full. Yet the impoverished in spirit cannot achieve this. If one merely peruses the divine texts in the mundane world or listens to their recitation, it does not count toward the required number of focused recitations during fasting.\n\nOne should first briefly study the rules and procedures, become familiar with the guidelines, and only then fast and recite. Three thousand repetitions constitute one completion; two sets of three thousand, one attainment; three sets of three thousand, one entry; and four sets of three thousand, one luminosity.",

      "translated_text": "The *Red Writ of Yu Yi* constitutes the Four Luminosities, dispersed as the *Responsive Scenery*. One must not glance at it briefly beforehand, then recite it once familiar—lest carelessness lead to oversight. This is the great taboo of the Eastern Statutes of the Azure Lad, causing one’s eyes to lose their steadfast radiance. Beware!\n\nOne should fix one’s gaze steadily upon the characters, reciting them slowly in a soft voice. If interrupted or misread, return and reread thirty characters from the stopping point. Purify yourself, burn incense, rinse your mouth, and face east at dawn to begin—just as when composing the *Yellow Writ of Lin*, known as the *Supreme Dao of Gentle Dawn*.\n\nDuring recitation, observe the three intervals of eating and rest: at chen, wu, and you hours. From nightfall until dawn, the cycle is complete. If, upon finishing one completion, one does not immediately fast and recite again, the timing may be adjusted at will, without mutual constraint. Should one wish to read further after one completion, one must fast anew as at the beginning.\n\nWithin the Terrace of Writing, the inscription on the *Utterly Remote Western Mountain* and the *Northern Absolute Stone* reads: *\"Inducement and assembly, ever joyous, refined and augmented discourse—this is the essence of the Dao, the luminous and expansive wisdom that comes with gentle and enlightened recitation.\"*\n\nThe meaning of this text is largely to encourage diligent study and recitation. The *Supreme Clarity Great Wisdom Writ*, the *True Elixir for Dispelling Demons*, the *Mysterious and Lofty Numinous Registers*, and the *Preface of the Highest Scriptures* received by the Supreme Dao Lord—these enable one to soar upon the wheel of the Great Void and sever the qi of the Six Heavens.\n\nThis scripture comprises seven scrolls, treasured and concealed by the Supreme Dao Lord. The Azure Lad has now excerpted and compiled one ten-thousandth of the *Dispelling Demons* chapters, interspersing them among the divine talismans.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao bestowed upon the Supreme Great Dao Lord the *Divine Tiger Grand Talisman*, the *Golden Tiger True Talisman*, and the *Writ of Pristine Wisdom*, commanding Lord Wang to transmit them to the *Knowers of the True*. He further instructed the Azure Lad to transmit them to the *Achievers of the True*. The *Knowers of the True* are those who attain truth through wisdom; the *Achievers of the True* are those who obtain truth through diligent seeking.\n\nThis text is to be transmitted solely by these two lords to those whose names are inscribed in the *Jade Writ of the Mysterious*. Other perfected ones must not rashly transmit it. Thus, the Supreme Lord instructed the Golden Gate Emperor of Later Saints, who entrusted it to the Two Lords of the Highest Minister and Highest Chancellor. Within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted thrice, first by sworn covenant. Once the covenant is complete, the transmission proceeds. Those who view it without covenant shall, for seven generations, be examined by the Three Yin Water Officials.\n\nThe Three Yin are the Three Officials of the Five Emperors, who govern the life and death of sinners. The First, the Left Official, judges the sins of the living. The Second, the Right Official, judges the sins of the dead. The Third, the Female Official, judges the sins of women. Additionally, the Left Water Official governs those who recklessly speak of heaven and earth, divulge celestial patterns, defame the Two Images, or offend the Three Luminaries. The Right Fire Official governs those who commit great treason, kill living beings, harm their masters or lords, or plot against their parents—crimes as vast as mountains.\n\nThe Five Palaces lie beneath Mount Tai, in the northern void of the cavern-heaven of Mount Tai. This small heaven spans four thousand li in circumference, entirely occupied by the Three Officials. Within the Mysterious are the Three Great Voids: the Jade Clarity Great Void, the Supreme Clarity Great Void, and the Supreme Ultimate Great Void. Within the Mysterious are the Three Voids; the Cavern is likewise so.\n\nThe Great Void lies beneath Mount Tai and above the Cavern-Heaven. The Cavern-Heaven lies beneath the Great Void and above the palaces of the perfected ones. The Nine Palaces of the Great Clarity also contain the Three Great Emptinesses. The Great Emptiness lies beneath the Supreme Ultimate Cavern-Heaven, within the void of the Five Peaks.\n\nThe Supreme Lord expounded on wisdom:\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao stood to the left of the Supreme Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord was at leisure in the Chamber of Harmonious Dawn within the Numinous Observatory, his seat arrayed with the Ninefold Purple Radiance of the Mysterious. To his right stood six great lion-like beasts. Then the True Person Jian Sheng and the Jade Clarity Divine Woman Fang Su, bearing the incense and blossoms of the Flying Qi of Vermilion Mound and holding the profound and subtle hidden chapters, took their places. The Supreme Dao Lord rinsed his mouth with azure water, exhaled crimson qi, calmed his heart, stilled his body, and concentrated his spirit upon the Mysterious. Girded with the Divine Tiger on his left and the Golden True Talisman on his right, he intoned the *Supreme Writ of Wisdom*, the *Supreme Chapters for Dispelling Demons with Numinous Elixirs*, the *Eight Mysteries*, the *Nine Perfected*, the *Seven Gates*, and the *Three Candles*.\n\nHe spoke of emptiness and nothingness, of the profound and recondite, of the thousand truths halting the wheel and the ten thousand spirits coming to rest. The numinous sounds soared upward, the will inscribed boundless fortune. Exquisite tones played in harmony, resonating like gold and jade. Above, they illuminated the hidden and obscure; below, they illumined the latent and concealed. The Mysterious Model flowed in elegance; the divine gaze was swift and keen. The Dao’s convergence knew no bounds; the rare melody awakened the profound. The whirlwind’s qi extended into the void; dust and ruins accumulated in the realm. Thus, the Mysterious Pearl possessed a radiance of longing, and the clear mirror stirred the records of tranquility.\n\nThe Great Dao was distant and complete; flying light shone afar. Each step stirred the numinous stream, startling the waves into pristine flight. Sinking into the Ninefold Darkness, one could scarcely hope to loosen one’s fetters. Transformations arose without expectation; abiding left no trace. Changes soared in the yang; rare was the dwelling in virtue’s radiance. The Twin Gates of Serenity and Joy led back to the awakening of principle’s subtleties. The Great Image of Uncarved Simplicity steadied the multitude; the vast river was set in motion. The Mysterious and the Cavern interpenetrated; principle’s subtlety connected the minute. One roamed and played with the divine blade, floating upon the vast expanse. Stirring the hundred yang, lightning was born; drumming the thousand yin, might was unleashed. The Six Heavens lost their qi; the Nine Demons were shattered and destroyed.\n\nGrasping the sun and vast rosy clouds, ten thousand mists entered the breast. In stillness, one harmonized with heaven and earth; in motion, one matched the radiance of the Seven Luminaries. In repose, one was secure though not secure; in peril, one was safe though not safe. One’s illumination pierced the waves and mist, binding the true and releasing the perching. At the Harmonious Dawn, the Two Absolutes intermingled; with a glance, the ten thousand darknesses opened of themselves. Thus, one’s feet trod the Seven Degrees, one’s hands held the Heavenly Mechanism. One’s crown covered the Mysterious Luminaries, uniting and returning the Two Modes. Rivers and mountains collapsed and burst; the Four Qi flowed and shifted. A hundred million hard and bright stones swiftly crumbled; the ears were suddenly opened. The numinous measure encompassed the falling, and the One Mysterious returned. Only those whose spirits were whole and whose emptiness was employed, whose wondrous melody soared in the Mysterious, could stir the Great Void without turning, give birth to the host of winds from the latent and keen, raise the Eight Luminaries to ascend, and lift the flying reins to the Clear Governance. They rode the carefree phoenix chariot to gaze from on high, released the cloud carriage to roam freely, rejoiced in the Nine Distances to cross the vast, soared upon the Purple Heaven to halt the Vermilion Radiance, delighted in the Seven Sources to circulate qi, crowned the Azure Ford to pour into the Crimson Well. The whirlwind, mist, waves, and lightning arose with the wondrous body; the void was stilled, the divine was revered, and the numinous ladder was eternally severed.",

      "translated_text": "The Vermilion Radiance now blazed forth, branching into the Mysterious River. Folding their wings to observe transformation, they soared toward the Empty Net. Myriad distinctions merged in reflection, the flying wheels ascending to Jade Align. Phoenixes trilled, dragons leapt, tigers roared, and phoenixes sang. Ten thousand echoes scattered like jade, a throng of gems burst into blossom. The jade grove stirred with wind, the crimson trees surged with flowers.\n\nThereupon they harmonized ten thousand tones, sending a thousand melodies aloft in flight. The numinous pattern unfurled, the cloud-neighbors revealed their forms. Vast transformation flowed at dawn, wondrous arts emerged at dusk. Loosening their sashes to roam in spirit, embracing their knees in pure serenity, they observed transformation without adornment, leveled the Mysterious without embellishment. Upright and open, they let the empty current flow; pure and flourishing, they entrusted themselves to radiant convergence. The Seven Luminaries shone eternally, neither forsaking nor prizing. Carefree and cold, they wandered the numinous; without singularity or counterpart, they revered the divine branches, singing as they walked in hidden grace.\n\nThey seized the heavens to prepare the liver, lions guarded the diaphragm. Scorching fire shielded the soul, bronze heads aligned the spirits. Long fangs and pricked ears leapt in reverse; the Lightning Father roused qi with doubled soles. Baring teeth and drawing in feet, the Thunder Duke clashed and pressed. Six eyes surveyed the camp, five tigers roared in unison. They bit blades to pursue evil, fierce beasts drove out filth. Rushing qi and thunder essence preserved life from falling.\n\nYet these numinous birds first arose from human movement. The Dao likewise aids life: ascending peaks to congeal spirit, shaking and parting the towering, they dispelled the Nine Calamities. Without thought, without emotion, they harmonized the Eight Images. Vessels of the Mysterious, qi light, they gazed sevenfold through the layered heavens, trailing fragrant blossoms and crimson splendor. Not-smoke blazed with numinosity; the potter’s wheel aligned with the True. They scattered simplicity, rinsed names, rinsed and savored the numinous brush. Spirit and qi leveled and cleared, they entrusted themselves to the waves of the Two Heavens. Lofty fragrance perfumed the dark; jade maidens held incense, purple consorts bore jars. They poured into the Celestial Pool, scattered flowers in the Jade Court. They issued summons to armored riders, marshaled the Heavenly Hosts. Poisonous dragons spewed yin, divine tigers deployed troops. Externally, they coiled with Mysterious qi; internally, they prepared the Seven Cities. Before the Dao descended to unite, they relied on might to give birth. The True achieved equal virtue; primordial qi merged with the Mysterious.\n\nThus the Jade Clarity Celestial Perfected, their hearts without empty shores, dwelled high in the Absolute Dark, embracing cinnabar in the cloud ravine. Extending to the adepts of the Supreme Dao, they contained brilliance and shone naturally. Reaching the adepts of supreme virtue, they savored solitude in the hidden and scattered. The Mysterious did not await the True; the signpost did not initiate radiance. They soared with the Great Dao by the banks of the Zhuang River, rising in emptiness to respond to the moment. Subtle and constant, their melody flew on distant strings, sound not awaiting plucking. The Nine Harmonies’ Mysterious resonance, the empty same in ultimate repose—thus they could sever their hearts beyond heaven, wondrously unite in a single vision.\n\nFrom this point onward, all were the dragon-luminaries of the Four Marshes, emitting essence as hidden immortals. They roamed in dreams through Jade Clarity, entrusted their forms to the Supreme Leisure. Waves reflected as they ascended the void; hands pushed aside the Eight Thousand. Bodies shook the Purple Whip; scarlet caps crowned lotuses. They blazed through the Seven Valleys, flew fragrance to rinse the mist. Essence pierced the Great Void; virtue and merit reached the Nine Heavens. They wore the sun and moon, dwelled serenely in the vast expanse. Flying wheels turned to the Northern Mound; loosened sashes wandered the Flower Garden. The Queen Mother of the West commanded the reins; they rode as companions to Turtle Mountain. Fourfold, they spread great grace; wondrously, they chanted the Supreme Mystery. The Six Yin’s beauty galloped forth to fulfill past affinities. Those whose virtue had not yet attained the distant, whose hearts had not awakened to the True, were all bestowed with jade fangs and lush blossoms, the Seven Yangs’ solar infants, the Nine Forest’s liquid, the Eight Jade’s essence, the Four Pistils’ purple nectar, the Five Pearls’ crimson bloom, the Three Flowers’ flying steel, the Twin Pearls’ lunar radiance. Orchid wine and golden grain, sweet dew in jade vases, azure silk and tender gauze, drifting mushrooms and flowing numinosity, divine channels and cinnabar dispersal, Mysterious boughs entwined, jade roots knotted at dawn. The Western August One’s plain abundance—with these they could soar through the Vermilion Empyrean, fly through the void of Jade Clarity. Inhaling to absorb them, they reached the True Numinous; rinsing to transform them, they entered the Purple Court. They could also take the Eastern Culmen’s Weaving Maiden’s water, the Western Limit’s Long Dusk and Yuqian, the Southern Exhaustion’s root of solar light, or the Northern Depths’ Palace of Grand Yin’s night.\n\nThereupon, in the vermilion summer, yang congealed; the radiant whirlwind soared afar. The Great Void plucked essence; the Two Images circled in light. The Eight Paths harmonized; riding the solemn, they conveyed fragrance. Transformation governed the Nine Absolutes; virtue flowed through the Jade Emperor. The three gates of the profound opened; the four divine portals spread wide. Auspicious clouds constructed the heavens; the Six Perfections brought felicity. Numinous winds scattered demons; the Dharma drum summoned troops. They roamed the shores to bathe in the azure waves, washing the soul and transforming the spirit, all gathering in the Dao site. Plucking the pure, grasping the panpipes, they harmonized qi to preserve longevity. Ingesting the blossoms’ essence, they aided external harmony. Below, they drew from the Mysterious current; above, they pushed open the empty same.\n\nI, unlearned and young, once played at the Dao’s lineage. Formerly, through virtue’s elevation, I was made an Immortal Sovereign. Flying and falling, I shed the world, soaring above the empty same. Scaled, I swam the dark ford; shaking, I stirred the celestial river. Morning and evening, amidst the host of immortals, I attended to life and death below. Suddenly, I heard of the Supreme Dao above Jade Clarity, the Mysterious Shore of the Utmost True. My aspiration yearned and my head lifted; I sat waiting for dawn. What fault was mine alone to indulge in this petty feast? How could I long be stained by the world’s dust, forever to be the Supreme August One’s delight?\n\nThereupon, I set aside the immortal’s scriptures, removed the crown of former ages. Though my body still wandered the flourishing groves, my heart dwelled beyond images. Vaguely, I sought lofty eminence, the jade pipes’ rare sound. Then I bid farewell to glory, scattered blossoms, shook my staff to ascend the lofty peaks. Chewing the qi-less, I drew in the Two Luminaries. Raising my wings, I journeyed like the wild swan, exhausting spirit to probe the towering. Silent and empty within, I gathered qi and tilted the tripod. In solitude, I guarded the Mysterious; through spring’s end, I sealed stillness. My insipid body self-lost, the corpse unbound and unkempt. Releasing form to preserve emptiness, I held nothing, grasped nothing.\n\nThen I opened the cavern gate in the Sparse Grove, sought the numinous traces in the Cinnabar Cavern. I dispatched the Nine Heavens’ vermilion casket, gazed toward the Jade Tablets of Supreme Clarity. The Mysterious Writ was engraved on jade tablets; the crimson name was first inscribed on the empty watchtower. I roamed the Five Peaks; ten thousand crags I visited in full. A hundred valleys, a thousand peaks—none I did not tread in sequence. Once I glimpsed the Jade Steps in the Purple Clarity’s clouds; twice I beheld the divine script in the brocade-clouded satchel. Four times I encountered the Three Primes in the Mysterious Terrace; six times I visited the Five Elders in the Numinous Chamber. Nine times I was carried by the Great Emperor; seven times I rode alongside the Highest in the same chariot. Then the heavenly gates spread wide, plainly penetrating the dark and bright. Extending the wheels, turning the carriage, I attended the high court’s grand assembly. Feathered capes and brocade robes, flowing bells and singing flutes, dragon crowns and phoenix skirts followed the clouds in carefree wandering. Dark and boundless, they equaled the morning; heart vast, body distant. Then I realized my past: healing the limping dragon’s hoard. Now I rise like the phoenix’s whirlwind—at this moment, truly self-sufficient and self-amused, I feast forever in the Purple Palace.",

They rode the carefree phoenix chariot to gaze from on high, released the cloud carriage to roam freely, rejoiced in the Nine Distances to cross the vast, soared upon the Purple Heaven to halt the Vermilion Radiance, delighted in the Seven Sources to circulate qi, crowned the Azure Ford to pour into the Crimson Well. The whirlwind, mist, waves, and lightning arose with the wondrous body; the void was stilled, the divine was revered, and the numinous ladder was eternally severed.",

      "translated_text": "To fathom the profound and measure the ultimate is especially difficult when facing the void—only then does one realize that the wondrous numinous observation of the Dao holds a thousandfold path. When the feet are whole and sound, and the mysterious heart stands firm as a wall, one then knows the fortune of seeking the steadfastness of the heart and the wholeness of the feet. Thus, many follow its lineage, but few reach its extremity.\n\nYet with an unyielding heart, one ascends to the jade purity of the True One’s resonance; with an unobstructed journey, one seeks the firmness of ultimate life. Only then may one attain jade radiance to equal illumination and ultimately receive the extended countenance of the Thearch. To wander aimlessly is to hope for nothing after ten thousand attempts; to focus single-mindedly is to have hope fulfilled ten thousandfold.\n\nThose who cling to external passions and seek refuge in mere existence, upon hearing the Dao, crawl forward on their knees—yet when the Dao remains silent, all vanish. Facing the mountains, their legs grow numb with cold; crossing the rivers, their blood surges in waves. Their five limbs assail one another over unfallen valleys, their whole body trembles on the brink of life and death. Such efforts merely exhaust their allotted years in toil, serving as mere adornments to fame and reputation. All this arises from a scattered, unfocused heart and a drifting, unstable nature. Day by day, their distractions grow, yet they remain unaware, corrupting rectitude and losing resolve, wandering lost in the forest of the Dao’s dream—how could they be worthy of the supreme Way?\n\nNow I shall reveal to you the transcendent arts of the numinous truth, the methods of celestial immortality, the grand esoteric essentials, and the *Scripture of Eternal Preservation in the Upper Realm*. If you wish to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, journey north to the Jade Thearch, spur the dragon to ride the light, and dwell in the palaces of the Upper Clarity; if you wish to hurl the jade wheels, turn the five celestial bodies, merge with the sun to radiate brilliance, and enter the moon to pierce its clarity—you must obtain the *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* and wear the divine *Golden Tiger Talisman*.\n\nWith the *Crimson Text of Yu Yi*, you may summon the sun to rise together; with the *Yellow Chapters of Jie Lin*, you may dwell with the moon. The *Cavernous True Scripture* allows you to roam with the five celestial bodies; the *Great Cavern True Scripture* scatters enmity across seven generations. Its thirty-nine chapters enable seven generations of ancestors to ascend as immortals. The *Eight Ways of the Yellow Elder* and the *Nine Numinous Writs*—the *Purple Text of the Ascending Numinous Writ* refines and restrains the hun and po; the *Golden Watchtower* records the annals. The *Treasure Registers of the Five Elders*, the *Hundred Mushrooms of the Jade Court*, the *Essence Medicines of the Upper Clarity*, and the *Excerpts from the Jade Clarity Scripture of Wisdom*—these declare:\n\nSix pure blossoms flourish, the eight-cornered radiance of the mysterious light; the seeds of wind and cloud, the jade threshold of the Thearch’s terrace; golden petals of the *jia* blossom, the vast yellow trees of heaven; the jade buds of Changcheng, the fire-jade of Mount Ye; the singing of the phoenix grove in Lu, the jade wine of the Western Jasper; the purple honey of the Central Hua, the green mounds of the Northern Ling; the golden marrow of the Crimson Ford, the moon’s essence and sun’s longevity; the *lang* seeds of the Vermilion River, the patterned gourds of Penglai; the seven stems of Zhuo Water, the lightning willows of collapsing peaks; plucking the green onions of the Northern Xuan Guo, sipping the crimson honey of cloud and water; the bones of the Night Ox, the yellow lacquer of the divine *wu*; the *ling* melons of Kongtong, one fruit every four kalpas; the gall of the *lin* in the Dark City, the midnight sun of Flame Mountain; gathering the cinnabar mulberries of Fusang above, harvesting the standing algae of the Long Abyss below; harmonizing the flying jade of the nine transformations above, swallowing the rosy treasures of the Azure Mystery below; the Great Void’s linked rings, the embrace of the Plain Girl; the purple *qiu* lads, the nine-colored phoenix brains; the hidden mushrooms of the Great Ultimate, the crimson trees of the sun’s path; the rainbow plums of the Supreme, the great herbs of the Celestial Han; the giant pearls of the Southern Palace, the *fu* elders of the Western Land; the three-beamed dragon flowers, sought by the numinous consorts—those who consume these will age only after heaven itself.\n\nThis is what the Jade Clarity consumes, what the Supreme treasures—enabling one to ascend and soar through the luminous clouds, divide the morning into myriad paths, guard and stabilize the imperial essence, and infuse the nine brains with morning light.\n\nYet this Way is vast and supremely subtle, its numinous radiance distant—it is not something those who consume blood and flesh may fully comprehend. Merely hearing its mysterious tones scatters the turbid; listening to its wind and qi dispels the impure. Above, it can float beyond the grand primordial; below, it can dispel demons and cure illnesses. Without a resonant root of virtue, who could merge with its numinous ease?\n\nThus, the highest method dispels demons by ordering qi through the myriad connections; the names of the supreme true medicines nurture the spirit and expel evil. Truly, these words are trustworthy.\n\nNext are the *Mysterious Mushrooms of the Upper Clarity* and the *Nine Seasons of the Supreme*. There are the *Eight Radiant Great Harmonies*, the *Mottled Dragon’s Black Embryo*, the *Patterned Tiger’s White Foam* from the Western Mound; the *Seven Dark Flying Nodes*, the *Nine-Aperture Jade Pearls*; the *Cloud Nectar* and *Jasper Wine*, the *Lang Yu* of the *Xuan Garden*; the *White Glue of Mount Zhong*, the *Golden Bloom of Green Spread*; the *Stone Brains of Langfeng*, the *Coral of the Black River*; the *White Phoenix of Mount Meng*, the *Jade Veins of the Numinous Mound*; the *Golden Blood of the Azure Luan*, the *Vermilion Leaves of Dongying*; the *Nine-Node Intertwined*, the *Purple Hemp of the Great Tenuity*; the *Jade Fruits of Qionghua*, the *Whale Pearls of Flowing Abyss*; the *Crimson Walls of the Red River*—drawing from the *Great Ultimate’s Well* at the center, plucking the *Crimson Veins of Wen Zhu*; the *Divine Peaches of the Cloud Court*, the *Flat Sparrows of Kun Garden*; the *Sun Grass of Night Essence*, the *Green Reed of Azure Ford*; the *Fragrant Altars of the True Palace*, the *Three Canopies of the Dark Capital*—wearing the light of the *Jade Lads* on the left, drawing the qi of the *Jade Maidens* on the right; summoning the *Divine Origin* above, drinking the *Mysterious Ripple* below; grasping the *Jade Essence of the Orchid Garden* above, plucking the *Purple [Herb]* of the Round Mound below; the *Spiritual Clams of White Water*, the *Red Scallions of the Eight Heavens*—one fruit every ten thousand years, nine ranks of flowing light. Those who consume these will depart after heaven itself.\n\nThis is what the Heavenly Thearch consumes, what the Supreme treasures—unheard of in the Great Ultimate, unattainable by the middle immortals. Reciting its chapters grants eternal life in the extraordinary currents; chanting its names can cure illnesses and sever demons. For the *Scriptures of Wisdom* dispel demons, their excerpts distilled from wondrous images; the *Numinous Mushrooms* and *Supreme Medicines*, the *Pure Songs of the True Thearch*, are but rough stimulants within the gaze of the Dao.\n\nWearing talismans and bearing the true, reciting the *Nine Simplicities*—this may suffice to fathom the natures of the myriad demons. Embracing the origin and receiving qi, studying the *Jade Mystery* at dawn—one must guard it beyond ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe four *hun* and nine *po* thus fulfill their functions within the body—using them brings joy beyond measure.\n\nNext are the grades of the Great Ultimate, the four true constant treasures: the *Nine Stones Refined in Smoke*, the *Elixir Liquid and Jade Nourishment*; the *Flowing Pearls of Xunshou*, the *Jasper Essence of Linhua*; the *Golden Liquid of the Cinnabar Furnace*, the *Purple Flowers and Rainbow Blossoms*; the *Nine Transformations of the Great Clarity*, the *Nectar of the Five Clouds*; the *Mysterious Frost and Descending Snow*, the *Leaping Three Yellows*; the *White Incense of Dongying*, the *Green Coins of Canglang*; the *Surplus Grain of High Mounds*, the *Flying Fields of Accumulated Stones*; the *Returning Elixir of the Great Void*, the *Mysterious Firmness of Taiqin*; the *Flowing Herbs of Eternal Light*, the *Flying Thousands of Cloud Lads*—these too enable one to ascend lightly and soar into the ethereal darkness.",

      "translated_text": "These are the substances consumed by the Heavenly Transcendents, the studies pursued by the soaring spirits—beyond the ken of wandering scholars or mountain recluses. One must further master the *Nine Transformations and Ten Changes*, the *Eight Hidden Earth Arts*, only then can one roam boundlessly through the Mysterious Void, stride backward along the Celestial River’s banks, ride clouds and mount dragons, soaring without limit.\n\nNext are the *Thirty-Six Mushrooms*, the *Flying Furnace’s Refined Smoke*, the *Yang Water and Moon Essence*, the *Five Stones’ Richness*—which replenish the five viscera, refine the countenance, and transform the body. There are also the *Radiant Petals and Cloud Fragments*, the *Golden Powder and Jade Tenderness*, which can prolong life and extend years, granting longevity up to ten thousand years.\n\nFurther still are the *Mysterious Water and Cloud Essence Elixir*, the *Five Yellows’ Profound Spirit*, the *Thousand-Stone Jade Draft*, the *Multicolored Reds and Greens*, the *White Chariot’s Flying Nodes*, the *Flowing Steed’s Purple Wood Essence*—a single dose instantly extends one’s lifespan by a thousand epochs. Daily consumption steadily lengthens life, years advancing with the medicine, destiny shifting with the elixir. These are indeed inexhaustible numinous substances, wondrous formulas of deathlessness.\n\nTo extend life by a thousand epochs, it is said, requires but a single *daogui* of the medicine. Before refining the lower elixirs, one must first prepare *Pine Resin and Shade Fat*, *Mountain Ginger and Hidden Spirit*, *Sweetflag and Asparagus*, *Giant Sesame and Yellow Essence*, *Chrysanthemum and Wolfberry*, *Cliff Honey and Poria*, *Peach Bark and Alisma*, *Weirui and Coptis*, *Cimicifuga and Rehmannia*, *Red Plates and Vermilion Blossoms*, *Cloud-Soaring Water Cassia*, and the essences of countless other substances. Though these are myriad in kind, only a fraction is mentioned here. Consuming them yields modest benefits, not eternal extension—at best, seven hundred years; at least, three or four hundred. Yet without discerning the path to enduring enjoyment, one cannot ascend to the Azure Heavens. They may restore radiance to the body, return the complexion to youthful whiteness, command a thousand spirits, and attain the rank of Earth Transcendent—traversing the Five Peaks, wandering renowned mountains—thus avoiding the certainty of death.\n\nYet one should gradually seek higher medicines to renew oneself, for such advancement is but a step on the ladder. Why cling to the old and refuse change, binding oneself to temporal limits? These arts demand gentleness, warmth, benevolence, and wholehearted sincerity—purifying the body, harmonizing the five viscera, calming the form, visualizing the spirit, preserving the hundred spirits, guarding the hun and refining the po, dispelling filth and cleansing impurities. The mind roams the *Double Mystery*, free from the desires of fleeting splendor; embracing unity, one wanders alone, unburdened by the dust of the world. Pungent spices and five acrid flavors must not pass the lips; rich, bloody flavors must not enter the intestines. Dwelling in mountain solitude, one must not pursue worldly affairs—only then can one above delve into the profound and preserve the true, summon spirits and invoke numinous talismans, and below consume the *Eight Stones* and practice *liquid and saliva* absorption.\n\nAs for the *Yin Elixir’s Internal Chamber Arts*, the benefits of the *Yellow Way and Red Qi’s* union, the essentials of *Seven-Nine Refining Essence and Exhalation*, the methods of the *Six-One Returning Elixir’s* yin-yang fusion—though these may confer the name of immortality, the *Upper Clarity* does not equate them with virtue. Though they achieve transformation, the *Supreme* does not hold them in esteem. These are the *Impure Transcendents and Tainted Perfected*—they cannot pass through the Jade Portal.\n\nMoreover, treading treacherous ice is perilous, often leading to ruin. Even those who survive remain but *Foul and Disorderly Earth Transcendents*. To aspire to lofty models is not worth attachment; to fixate on the near is to fall short of *guiding and absorbing qi*, the arts of *embryonic breathing and mind-sealing visualization*, the *Mysterious Spirit’s Central Scroll*, the *Golden Casket’s Hidden Principles*, the *Yellow Court’s Inner and Outer Scriptures*, and the *Great Clarity’s Guarding Records*. Such methods, numbering in the thousands, have all circulated among the common folk and are known to the masses. Since the middle ages, from the time of the Yellow Emperor onward, those who have ascended and transcended through these arts are as numerous as mountains—impossible to count.\n\nSuch dedication of the heart, such steadfastness in preserving essence, such firmness in upholding conduct, such resolve in purpose—possessing these four virtues, I shall help you shatter demons and ascend as a transcendent. Yet for those of unstable nature who practice these arts, even after years or decades, they may gain no benefit. Why? Some fail to grasp the principles of *guiding and absorbing breath*; others are misled by external distractions, succeeding only to fail. Some briefly gain benefits but cease at the onset of illness; others receive teachings from masters but cannot discern them. Some lack single-minded focus, their spirits scattered; others accumulate sins and offenses, violating heavenly taboos. Some arbitrarily alter scriptural formulas, adding or omitting at will. Such cases are common—these are frivolous, arrogant, and filthy individuals, given to empty words, beyond instruction.\n\nThus, the Great Dao does not spread throughout the world, and true transcendents rarely wander the earth—this is the deep fault of humanity, not the burden of our fellowship. The key lies in simplicity, free from scheming, inwardly observing the *Eight Paths*, counting the spirits and beckoning the hun, neither careless nor overprotective, reducing the *Nine Hun* to ashes, embracing unity and roaming the dark, the five viscera never straying, the *liquid and qi* mysteriously congealing. Facing death without fear, encountering the strange without faltering, releasing the celestial form into the empty vastness, gathering the spirit and harmonizing it to guard essence.\n\nThen, from what does the great trial arise? From where do illusions emerge? No metal or stone can compare to its great substance; no eight streams can rival its profound stillness. Such clarity of talent is truly heaven-born—yet it may also be swiftly attained through learning, or even achieved without seeking.\n\nStrictly speaking, transcendence cannot be forcibly sought, nor can the true be schemed for. Without the *Mysterious Registers*, one cannot hear the *Sutras of Wisdom*; without the *Jade Scriptures*, one will never see the *Divine Golden Tiger Chapters*; without ardent longing for flying transcendence, one cannot know the *Great Ultimate and Upper Clarity*.\n\nIn summary: destiny, will, essence, diligence, practicing hidden virtue, rescuing from disaster, aiding the poor and distressed, establishing benevolent deeds. Uniting these, one faces all things with a compassionate heart, never directing malice toward any living being. This is the gateway to the Dao’s essentials, the secluded chamber of attaining the Way.",

      "translated_text": "The *Hidden Writ of the Divine Tiger of the Eight Arts of the Most High’s Wisdom Dispelling Demons*—those who attain it enter samādhi and live without death across all lives. Compiled into a chapter by the Azure Lad of the Upper Rank.\n\nShould one of steadfast resolve and karmic destiny encounter this text, all who receive it must first perform purification rites, present golden dragons and jade fish, and swear solemn oaths. These are the names of the ten thousand spirits and hosts of the world, the hidden taboos of a thousand demons and ten thousand specters. Thus compiled into this writ, the Lord of the Great One ever guards it with ghostly soldiers—take care not to transmit it lightly.\n\nThe Lord of the Great Dao then plucked the *Cloud Zither of the Radiant Dragon*, its celestial tones soaring in a thousand flights, myriad echoes intertwining and surging. Resplendent harmonies billowed forth, purple mists swirling in shade, while the Eight Mystic Winds arose. Thereupon the Jade Phoenix stretched its neck, the Golden Simurgh composed its qi, dragons intoned over sapphire waves, and tigers leapt upon the divine continent. Nine whistles harmonized in chorus, the Mystic Chord resonating through the void. Subdued beasts rolled up their sleeves, fierce steeds bared their throats, mountains reared across forests, and swords were clenched to seize the perverse. A tumult of voices arose, a hundred wolves and monstrous apes clamored.\n\nThen he commanded the handmaidens of the Jade Clarity Upper Palace—An Faying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, and Cun Yunmen—to join in singing the *Divine Poetry of Expelling Spirits* and the *Melody of Dispersing Numinous Beings*. Its verses proclaimed:\n\nFloating, floating, the reins of the Great Rosy Clouds,\nEightfold ascent to the Cloud Encampment.\nThe divine lineage orders the numinous heart,\nDragon brushes adorn the Jade Capital.\nGolden gates entwine in lush abundance,\nNine chambers gleam with purple jade.\nA lofty chariot crosses the Northern Origin,\nRustling into the Unborn.\nThe Vermilion Tiger guides the divine master,\nGreen shafts ascend to the Upper Clarity.\nThe Four Mysteries illumine the morning prohibitions,\nEmbracing blossoms, returning to the Phoenix City.\nThe Seven Perils yet bear the green of Brahman,\nAspiring to mark the Ninefold Origin’s thoroughfare.\nProclaiming the radiance of the Treasured Great Splendor,\nThe whirlwind dances, leaping through the unfolding light.\nOrdering the reins to open the Primal Homeland,\nThe River Spirits have already taken the lead.\nYin clouds gird the night’s sun,\nThe candle-moon suddenly meets at first exchange.\nBinding the luminous, the unborn spirit,\nLeading together to return to the void.\nTen thousand sources pour into the Northern Valley,\nRiding the void back to the streaming stars.\nExtinguishing light to pluck the floating wanderer,\nPeaks soar like waves in the sky.\nEntwined in the abode of joyous music,\nSubtle wonders emerge toward the empty.\nThe carefree dwelling in the cinnabar and mysterious origin,\nThe Great Void’s Dao flows red and unimpeded.\nDark and bright wield the numinous tally,\nHow could hidden reckoning stray or be lost?\nThe Fallen Mystery reveals the host’s assembly,\nBirth’s beginning seems a long dream.\nVirtue conceals its traces within the subtle,\nUtter stillness unknowingly becomes.\nThe divine essence moves the Great Simplicity,\nMist and reflection dwell where they will.\nMystic echoes resound beyond the bold,\nHow could the hidden boughs give rise to doubt?\nHarmonizing with the morning drum’s long fan,\nRadiant rosy clouds arise here.\nCutting off the abyss’s dark and boundless flow,\nSoaring wings reach the Sixfold Terrace.\nThe Divine King enters the Jade Void,\nUtter nonbeing invades the vermilion troops.\nThe Nine Netherworlds meet in distant obscurity,\nThe wondrous assembly is already at peace.\nThe Dao’s treasury, the Golden Ultimate’s chapter,\nStrummed and tuned to blazing glory.\nA thousand dragons spew green waters,\nThe Nine Rivers pour out in exhaustion.\nVast mists seize the remote abode,\nNuminous waves fill the Fourfold Canopy’s court.\nHeads aligned, gazing toward the towering palace,\nNo reckoning of form or name.\nLeading and drawing in the Primal Harmony,\nFlourishing and freely grasping the Mystic Principle.\nContaining essence, blazing in the cloud chambers,\nRustling and assisting the pure, fading records.\nThe numinous Dao hastens to the Orchid Gate,\nThe Mysterious Mysterious at once arrays itself.\nTen thousand peaks are but a marvelous sight,\nAbove the clouds dwell the Jade Children.\nThrough kalpas, harmonizing with jade splendor,\nNo awareness yet begins.\nThe source spirits equal the Cavern’s transformation,\nSinking and submitting, forgetting the signs of samādhi.\nThe River Lord binds the Upper Observatory,\nThe Radiant Pearl adorns the Jasper Court.\nPrinciple has no duality beyond the void,\nHow could congealing clarity ever wane or wax?\nThe Great Yang exchanges with the Heavy Yin,\nTurning and sweeping, abiding in the fallen dark.\nTogether entrusted beyond the Six Perceptions,\nThe numinous chant unites in a single voice.\nThe turning jade pivots the Han’s Dao,\nBrilliant and resplendent, stirring the flowery jasper.\nTen thousand spirits mount vermilion steeds,\nA thousand demons have no leisure to arise.\nSpecters vanish in the Palaces of Water and Fire,\nThe true body treasures the Great Perfection.\n\nThe Four Lifespans of the Northern Alas,\nOrdering the divine, steadying the reins.\nSummoning the Earth Deities,\nThe earth spirits conceal their qi.\nMountains and peaks hide the clouds,\nThe Nine Sources are cut off and extinguished.\nPushing and examining the thousand spirits,\nSeizing captives with thunderous might.\nThe Northern Emperor opens the Dao,\nThe Four Illuminations attend the chariot.\nCrushing and shattering the ten thousand perverse,\nCarving and severing Mount Feng.\nNine ghosts share a single head,\nA thousand demons share a single body.\nThe Five Emperors wield their axes,\nThe Divine Lords exhale mist.\nPurple clarity refines the observance,\nVermilion qi coils in layers.\nSpirits flee to the Night Terrace,\nEssences hide in eternal continuity.\nPoisonous beasts a thousand feet long,\nSlaughtered without kinship.\nWhat petty specters gather in hundreds or thousands,\nExchanging qi, gazing together at the Gate of Human Life?\nThe Divine Tiger unleashes its might,\nBeheading monstrous apes and decapitating owls.\nThe wondrous Dao of the Great Nonbeing,\nThe utmost numinous selects and approves.\nYou who now receive this,\nForever wear it upon your person.\nTen thousand trials will not contest you,\nA thousand specters will not approach.\nThe Jade Splendor arrives at the chamber,\nHeavenly Perfected wander and circle.\nRecite and illumine the numinous tones,\nAscend to pay homage to the Three Origins.\n\nWhen the song concluded, the Lord of the Great Dao then commanded Yu Lixuan, the Jade Lad of the Left Mystery, to take up the Purple-Gold Feathered Staff and summon the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity condensed his refined qi, wielding the True Staff in the void. Whistling and commanding the ten thousand spirits, he marshaled the authority of the Primal Origin. Holding the Golden Truth, he gazed serenely upon the Great Origin. Suddenly hearing the command, he swiftly set forth, mounting his feathered chariot. The Vermilion Sovereign opened the Dao, and the armored Heavenly Soldiers were arrayed. Ten thousand tigers drove out the perverse, golden dragons led the troops. The Jade Staff cast its light, flying blossoms entered the dark. Turbid currents transformed the ranks, advancing to activate the Solar Essence. Striking the azure drum’s surging waves, sounding the jasper bell’s resounding peals. Thereupon the Mystic Chord harmonized, the grand music halted behind. Nine phoenixes stretched their necks and sang, a hundred dragons held the nectar in their jaws and joined in chorus. Golden essences leapt in melody, eight simurghs soared and danced. Purple banners rose into the sky, brocade pennants wound through the fields. Green canopies arrayed in shade, the winding morning suddenly arose. Flowing bells tossed and turned, their moonlit echoes penetrating. Jasper branches displayed the true, lingering amidst the Five Symbols. Fragrant blossoms scattered mist, petals of the Three Luminaries. Light rosy clouds received the radiance, thin mists girded the light. The reins rang upon the Seven Paths, the Eight Chariots floated in the void. Nine thousand empty carriages, guarded by poisonous dragons. Racing clouds hastened to the mysterious, gathering qi and seizing the wind. The heavens brightened, bursting forth, the Eight Lights hazy and indistinct. The Perfected Woman rode on the right, the Numinous Lad was commanded on the left. In an instant, a thousand myriads arrived at the Upper Palace. Halting the chariot at the Jade Clarity, transcending the Emperor’s ramparts, pacing the Purple Gates, bowing to await announcement.",

      "translated_text": "After a long while, the Supreme Great Dao Lord then commanded the Four Ministers of the Dawn Attendant to slowly lead forward, ascending the portal of the Elixir Pearl and entering the inner chamber of the Sevenfold Radiance. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity addressed him by name, saying: \"Your humble servant has now arrived. I beg to hear the Great Mandate.\"\n\nThe Supreme Great Dao Lord replied: \"Li Shanyuan’s virtue aligns with the Seven Sages, and he shall be lord of the Golden Watchtower. Soon he will pay homage to the Ten Heavens, governing the destinies of the multitudes. He shall determine the Middle Prime within the Mystery’s mechanism, regulate yin and yang to harmonize their heads, elevate the perfected and promote the worthy, seal the rivers and summon the seas, decide life and death, grasp the might of heaven, decapitate the Six Heavens, and oversee the punishments of the Three Bureaus. He shall bind the Northern Emperor, and you, Eminent Lord, shall attend his chariot. His Dao is lofty and eminent, his virtue vast and far-reaching. His charge is weighty, and his authority commensurate. I have already instructed him in wisdom, and further recorded for him the *Scripture of Vanquishing Demons*. Wisdom can drive away spirits, and vanquishing demons can extinguish evil. Moreover, I bestow upon him the True Talisman of the Divine Tiger, that he may wield its might to decapitate the Six Heavens. I chant for him the *Lofty Chapter of Commanding Spirits*, to aid him in dispersing filth and banishing calamity.\n\nFurthermore, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity treasures the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger, by which the spirits of heaven and earth are controlled. With a single rebuke, he may shatter and slay a thousand essences; wearing it, he may cause ten thousand ghosts to vanish. All demons that rashly invade shall perish, and every malevolent spirit that gazes upon it shall be struck blind. Should we not together confer this upon Shanyuan, to fulfill his charge?\"\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bowed his head in assent, then untied his cloud-scribed satchel and opened the jade casket. Sevenfold radiance illuminated the plain silk, streaming sunlight revealed the truth, and ninefold brilliance paused in splendor as flying incense intertwined.\n\nBefore the talisman was bestowed, he commanded the attendants of the Grand Tenuity—Ji Linhua, Yan Caiyun, Zhu Tiaoyan, and Han Fangyao—to join in singing the *Poem of the Golden Perfected* and the *Melody of Pacing the Void*. Their verses ran:\n\nThe Supreme Darkness severs the Four Mysteries,\nThe cavern’s scene entrusts divine communion.\nJade terraces spread crimson auroras,\nGreen mists hold golden ramparts.\nAbove, they ladle from the Cloud-Pearl Ridge,\nGazing upward toward the Peak of No Blade.\nThe numinous mirror gleams with purple coils,\nMisty foam radiates into the empty sky.\nMysterious transformations entwine the dark jade,\nLifting the rhythm, they lead the purple youths.\nThe round path has no stagnant veils,\nBrocatelle mists layer upon layer.\nSouthward, they push open the vermilion mound’s gates,\nWestward, they cross the jagged window’s gap.\nTheir forms dance upon ten thousand ripples,\nTheir spirits tread the ten directions.\nThe dark returns to the still axle,\nThe upper resonance rides the celestial dragon.\nMysteriously, they dispel the flying-scene chariot,\nBrandishing bells, they roam the Seven Paths.\nLight and clear, they cross the cloud-dust ford,\nIn an instant, they arrive at the Jade Prefecture.\nOn the left, they grasp the Jade Radiance’s consort,\nOn the right, they command the Golden Perfected’s husband.\nAbove, they join the soaring-aurora worthies,\nBelow, they aid the numinous and wondrous multitudes.\nThey wind through the vast Cold Palace’s halls,\nParting brocade, they enter the divine mounds.\nPhoenix-brain solidifies kalpas,\nFlower-nectar reverses blossoms’ decay.\nThe Supreme feasts in longevity’s harvest,\nDecreeing destinies for the myriad branches’ steps.\nThe Three Awakenings uphold the dark reckoning,\nUnfettered joy gleams in the ivory turn.\nThe whirlwind’s brilliance halts the jade’s splendor,\nHow the purple cassia sways!\nThe forest’s fruit rings through the nine auroras,\nJade staves march toward the Grand Tenuity.\nThe yellow writ restrains the blade of virtue—\nHow rare the radiance of the perfected!\nDiscarding the plain, they enter the formless,\nA hundred images begin to vanish together.\nThe yang’s cinnabar qi’s tip bursts forth,\nResplendent, the crimson clouds take flight.\nIn accord with the Jade Radiance’s stillness,\nDazzling, they hang in the Upper Clarity’s precincts.\nSpirits and numina respond to the dark reckoning,\nFollowing resonance, they summon the world’s omens.\nVast ford’s waves surge in profusion,\nJoining scenes, they mingle with the countenance’s descendants.\nMajestic, the Golden Watchtower’s scion,\nDesolate, he enters the cloud’s verge.\nLooking up and down, the myriad changes shift—\nHe will comply, in harmony with the essence’s pact.\nThe dark perches on the Stillness Terrace,\nClearly chanting wisdom and intelligence.\nVanquishing demons extinguishes ten thousand blades,\nBrandishing verse to expel filth.\nThe Golden Tiger bears heaven’s might,\nSubduing spirits to conceal their qi.\nSweeping away a thousand myriad acres of demons,\nFor ten thousand leagues, no evil speck remains.\n\nThereupon, the great spirits severed blood, the hundred essences lost their sight. The Golden Tiger bared its fangs, spitting might and releasing poison. It seized ghosts without pause, slicing open bellies and severing heads. The Six Heavens bowed together, spirits and numina instantly cowered. Birds and beasts hid their cries, forests and grasses prostrated themselves.\n\nThe Supreme Prime’s marvels were extraordinary, the numinous script luminous and lush. Wearing it and advancing, one may pay court to the Jade Emperor, offering rites in the jeweled chamber where the host of perfected gather.\n\nShould the Divine Tiger’s script be leaked, calamity shall reach the nine clans. Should the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger be divulged, misfortune shall extend to the seven ancestral forebears. Shanyuan, guard it well—you are the flower of the Dao and virtue.\n\nWhen the song concluded, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bestowed upon Lord Li the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger. They swore oaths, expressed gratitude, and each departed.\n\nLord Li, having received the two talismans and heard the Supreme’s discourses on the *Scripture of Wisdom* and the *Scripture of Vanquishing Demons*, then instructed the Azure Lad of the Upper Prime to compile them with the Four Assistants of the Upper Minister into a single text, to be employed regularly and transmitted to those destined to become perfected in the next seven hundred years, permitting three transmissions.\n\nThese verses’ subtle and wondrous sounds mostly comprise the hidden names of heaven, earth, the myriad essences, and the host of spirits, as well as the secret appellations of a thousand demons, poisonous beings, and malevolent spirits. The Supreme chants their names to manifest their transformations, to narrate their affairs, and to seal their talismans.\n\nThe divine radiance surveys the eight vistas, the numinous cavern’s marvels are wondrously arrayed. The secret talismans of might and the demon-vanquishing charms—this Divine Tiger leads their ranks, the Golden Tiger follows in order. Wisdom flourishes within the text, and vanquishing demons is set forth between its lines.\n\nShould one feel fear or dread in the night, merely reciting these two poems will cause a thousand essences to scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand people. When mountains and rivers hear this chant, their spirits shall all wield whips, turning toward the sound to bow in reverence.\n\nHow much more so when wearing the divine gold to illumine the Six Heavens—how could they not gather and submit? If a scholar of the Dao’s resolve travels the Five Peaks, desiring to ascend as an immortal and soar beyond, without the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger bearing the taboo names of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity and the Lord of the Great Unity, his name shall not be recorded in the immortal’s register.\n\nWearing this talisman and reciting the demon-vanquishing scripture, a thousand essences shall scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand people. When mountains and rivers hear this chant, their great spirits shall all wield whips, turning toward the sound to bow in reverence.",

      "translated_text": "If one wears the taboo names of the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity and the characters of the Lord of the Great Unity, one must first present offerings of faith and sincerity to receive the oral instructions from a master. One must not traverse defiled or impure places—this is the secret and wondrous art of the hidden techniques of the Eight Earths. Take great care not to lightly disclose this; transmitting it to the unworthy shall bring calamity for a hundred generations. If the time is not ripe to receive this, fearing its revelation, seal it away in a renowned mountain.\n\n*The Wondrous True Scripture of the Supreme Dao on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons, Scroll Two* ends here.\n\n*The Wondrous True Scripture of the Supreme Dao on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons, Scroll Three*\n\n**Chapter on Guarding the One**\n\nThe Supreme Dao addressed the Lord Emperor of the Golden Portal, saying: All mortals of courage and might who follow the precepts and regulations, restrain their minds and bodies, accumulate merit and virtue, and eternally become great sages must do so by guarding the One.\n\nThe One is formless yet capable of response; when response reaches its limit, form arises. Effects follow causes, and the One alternates between existence and non-existence. It is boundless and infinite, without labor or loss, without decrease or increase, without fault or burden, without death or birth. The birthless is eternally born, and the eternally born is deathless. The birth of the deathless gives rise to all things, and all things receive life from this deathless source. The deathless can generate life, creating countless beings. Those who guard it attain wisdom; those who abandon it fall into folly. Folly leads to death, while wisdom preserves life.\n\nLife is precious and desired by all, for all delight in life and detest death. Yet those who seek life fail to live, and those who fear death hasten their demise. Failing to grasp the Dao of life and death, they stray from their aspirations. To not stray from one’s aspirations depends entirely on wisdom. Wisdom first arises from knowing the One. The One generates qi, and qi begets mutual generation. One must neither forget nor neglect it, nor obstruct or suppress it. To suppress qi in pursuit of life severs the generative qi, and severance leads to death, from which there is no return to life. Enduring eternal suffering, the wise awaken to this truth. To awaken late is to be without knowledge. Lack of knowledge plunges one into ignorance, and the ignorant are difficult to transform. Though transformed, they remain unaware; though aware, they do not diligently practice; though diligent, they cannot persist; though persistent, they cannot refine their practice; though refined, they leak and dissipate—this is called lack of resolve. Lack of resolve leads to delusion, and delusion, if uncorrected, is not wisdom. Wisdom is to turn from delusion and enter the Dao, to abandon the perverse and return to the upright.\n\nGuard the generative qi, for qi begets mutual generation. The generative qi transforms and unites, dividing into three: the first is the Primordial Origin, the second is the Originating Cavern, and the third is the Mysterious Void. The lower is the Mysterious Qi, which governs the Void, curing illness and dispelling calamities—one may ride the Void. The middle is the Original Qi, which governs the Cavern, prolonging life and preventing death—one may remove obstacles. The upper is the Primordial Qi, which governs the Origin, ensuring unce",

Between the eyebrows, one *cun* inward lies the Hall of Light; two *cun* inward, the Cavern Chamber; three *cun* inward, the Upper Cinnabar Field, also called the Mud-Pill Palace, one *cun* square, where purple *qi* surges to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, nine *cun* in circumference, illuminating ninety thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms—now vast, now minute—swift as a flash, the body forgotten, all held in the mind’s intent.\n\nThe Upper Prime Child resides beneath the canopy of the Mud-Pill Palace, named *Xuan Ning Tian*, styled *San Yuan Xian*, also called *Bo Wu Shang* and *Bo Shi Hua*, and holds the title Lord Emperor of the Mud-Pill Heaven. To his right is the Imperial Minister, named *Zhao Le Jing*, styled *Zhong Xuan*, also called *Qi Fei* and *Chang Fu*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants.\n\nThe heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field, called the Crimson Palace, one *cun* square, where vermilion mist ascends to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, seven *cun* in diameter, illuminating seventy thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms into the Middle Prime Perfected, named *Shen Yun Zhu*, styled *Zi Nan Dan*, also called *Sheng Bo* and *Shi Yun Ju*, and holds the title Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace. To his right is the Assisting Sovereign Minister, named *Zhong Guang Jian*, styled *Si Hua Ling*, also called *You Che Bo* and *Chong Shi Hua*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants, seated facing each other.\n\nThree *cun* below the navel lies the Gate of Destiny, the Cinnabar Field Palace, one *cun* square, where white *qi* surges to the heavens. Within it is a solar image, five *cun* in circumference, illuminating fifty thousand *li* beyond. My form transforms into the Lower Prime Infant, named *Shi Ming Jing*, styled *Yuan Yang Chang*, also called *Ying’er Tai* and *Bo Shi Yuan*, and holds the title Primordial King of the Yellow Court. To his right is the Guardian Stabilizing Minister, named *Gui Shang Ming*, styled *Gu Xia Xuan*, also called *Feng Shen Bo* and *Cheng Guang Sheng*. Both appear naked, their forms like infants, seated facing each other.\n\nBy meditating upon the Three Ones over time, they will manifest. Their manifestation brings divine penetration and the attainment of wisdom. Those who cultivate wisdom yet fail to refine their focus, or whose unity remains unperfected and unmanifest, whose spirits remain unintegrated, will still encounter misfortune. Though matters may be unclear, even if one has grasped the method, life is not yet secure. Those who, knowing themselves, scorn others—what others can achieve, fools dismiss as trivial, paying no heed. With intent unheld, understanding eludes them. Though comprehension may not be essential, it is still employed. Employing it with harmonious light, the foolish find it difficult, the wise find it easy. To abandon it entirely is not the Way, nor is clinging to it. Failing to align with the world, one cannot bring aid—this is not wisdom.\n\nAll arts and skills, games and entertainments, male and female spirits, beauty and ugliness, diverse methods, deeds of body, speech, and mind, sounds and sights, touch and obstruction, movement and stillness, concealment and revelation, transformation and illusion, floating and sinking, existence and nonexistence, authority and substance, orthodoxy and heterodoxy, strength and weakness, ominous words—all actions under heaven—if even one remains unmastered, this is not wisdom.\n\nThose who cultivate wisdom must embrace the One and never depart from it. To depart from the One is to lose wisdom, for all is the work of the Three Pengs. The Upper Peng enslaves the hun and po, and greed and lust bring aging. The Middle Peng enslaves the spirit of consciousness, and anger and resentment bring illness. The Lower Peng enslaves essence and will, and ignorance brings death. Death returns one to the ranks of ghosts, called corpses. The suffering of corpse-ghosts is the work of the Three Pengs, hence their name. Fierce and unruly, they are difficult to subdue. Failing to subdue them, the body’s spirits grow vexed, harmed and broken, sinking into the wind-blades of darkness, enduring torment and agony, a sorrowful eternal night, endless as the kalpas of dust—how can one not fear this?\n\nThe wise first govern the Three Ghosts: restrain greed and lust, avoid entanglement in disputes, suppress anger and resentment, and prevent lawsuits and strife. When strife ceases, disputes end, and punishment does not reach death. Death arises from stagnation, and stagnation from ignorance. Disputes and strife provoke extreme exertion, heedless of retreat, leading to death and calamity. The suffering of calamity is cruel and bitter—regret comes too late.\n\nThus, in cultivation, one must first embrace the One. Embracing the One and preserving the spirit, all affairs flow without stagnation. Acting without acting, daily diminishing to perfect virtue—though greed and lust may briefly arise, one can repent and change. Though anger and resentment may occasionally flare, one can suppress and transform them, ultimately avoiding stagnation. To avoid stagnation is to escape death and attain longevity.\n\nYet fleeting greed and lust are easy to cling to but hard to dispel. Greed for pines may be easy, but lust and anger are far more difficult. All sentient beings wish to prevail. When others impose upon me, the mind cannot bear it. Unable to bear it, one retaliates, and disputes arise. Once arisen, they are hard to halt, leading to death and ruin.\n\nSwear devotion to the Dao, guard the One and never depart. It is easier to refrain from offending others than to prevent others from offending oneself. If offended, do not retaliate; let go of vengeance. If vengeance must be taken, do so with the Dao, offering further enlightenment, dissolving enmity, and entering together into truth. Without harboring resentment, forever united in the source—those who deviate from this path are not wise.\n\nThe wise lead by example, as the Most High knows all below. The refined words form teachings, and the teachings are chanted in seven stanzas, as follows:\n\n1. To know the One yet not guard it, or guard it without firmness, or hold it without constancy—this is not wisdom.\n2. To know the Three yet not govern them, or govern them without strictness, or maintain strictness without permanence—this is not wisdom.\n3. To know peril yet not avoid it, or avoid it without secrecy, or maintain secrecy without constancy—this is not wisdom.\n4. To know words yet not cherish them, or cherish them without encouragement, or encourage without fruition—this is not wisdom.\n5. To know the world can be governed yet not stabilize it, or stabilize it without flourishing—this is not wisdom.\n6. To know the Dao can be practiced yet not clarify it, or clarify it without grandeur—this is not wisdom.",

      "translated_text": "7. To know the absence of knowing yet not refine it, or refine it without precision, or maintain precision without scrutiny—this is not wisdom.\n\nThese seven awakenings are chanted in seven stanzas, forming natural scripture. From the Most High of old to my own self today, and for those who will ascend in the future, all recite this text to dispel demonic trials, extinguish all heretical doubts, remove confusion and banish delusion, return from the peripheral to the fundamental. When the fundamental is firmly established, the peripheral is jointly cultivated. With each diligent effort and each breath, merit and transgression shift. In the cycle of going and returning, encounter and response arise instantly. As soon as there is resonance, there is movement; through movement, the dull and benighted are enlightened. The benighted attain clarity, and clarity returns to true awakening. Awakening perceives all as nothingness, and within nothingness lies the wondrous. The wondrous qi transforms and refines the false into the real. The real arises from the five virtues, and the virtues converge in the six penetrations. The penetrations are sustained by the seven awakenings, and the awakenings are chanted in response to resonance. The resonance manifests as a name, and the name is called \"response.\" Following causes, one enters effects, with verification and evidence, without deviation or error.\n\nWithin the seven and five lies the six, and the six undergo transformations to achieve completion. Even resonance awaits verification; movement is made manifest. Traces arise from my resonance, and I possess the name of resonance. Though names differ, their essence is the same. Verification and manifestation create distinction, distinguishing stillness from movement. The far shore is initially divided: one divides into two, two generates three, and three completes the six. The six forms thirty-six traces, and the thirty-six traces converge in one mind. The source of the mind is fundamentally one, yet its streams are boundless. The great divisions number six, governing emergence and submergence. Practicing this ascends beyond the Three Realms; neglecting it descends into the Nine Dark Abysses. Wisdom and practice of the six enable transcendence beyond the Three Realms and deliverance from the suffering of the Nine Abysses—hence the name \"Six Perfections.\" The thirty-six heavens of the six sixes all cultivate the Six Perfections:\n\n1. **Diligence**: Practicing goodness without slackening.\n2. **Faith**: Devoted to the Dao without forgetfulness.\n3. **Yielding**: Guarding the One with softness.\n4. **Perseverance**: Maintaining the beginning without failure.\n5. **Admonition**: Halting evil without resistance, preserving both self and others.\n6. **Renunciation**: Abandoning wine and lust, harmonizing light to commune with spirits, blending with the world to plant the Dao, free from confusion and stagnation—this is wisdom.\n\nThis wisdom is ever clear and luminous. Even when offering libations, one remains undimmed, neither benighted nor stagnant, communing with spirits and aiding the multitude. It binds to the Dao and cultivates humanity, present yet not disordered—hence the name \"renunciation.\" Renunciation lies in non-stagnation; stagnation lies in violating precepts. Violating precepts leads to confusion—this is not wisdom.\n\nFor those who study and practice, preserving the spirit and revering virtue, though not yet free from dependence, they cultivate frugality to demonstrate integrity. They honor daily diminution, manifest integrity to the spirit, offer sustenance to the worthy and virtuous, express utmost sincerity, and adhere to the laws and regulations—without excess.\n\nWine is the essence of grains and water, capable of circulating qi and fluids. Moderation in it connects with the numinous and benefits nature; indulgence in it disrupts the spirit and harms life. Surrendering to intoxication leads to oblivion—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe source is naturally one; the mysterious two forms images. The two qi flow and moisten, harmonizing into three threes. The three ones circulate universally, and the sages share the same year. Overflowing virtue fills all, and the two halves generate life. The two halves become one, and each one is boundless. Abandoning virtue for lust, neglecting the cultivation of humanity, indulging desires and following passions—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe flow of wisdom knows the sun’s decline and the moon’s waning. The august spirits revere it, prioritizing the generation of life. From self-cultivation to benefiting others, transmission and transformation never cease. Take care not to deviate from this.\n\nWhen the two qi lose harmony, either yin congeals with yin or yang entangles with yang. Men may gather excessively with women, or women may cluster around men. Noble and base intermingle, Daoists and laypeople jostle in confusion. Jealousy, resentment, and anger arise, leading to isolation and exaltation. This severs lineage and extinguishes descendants, causing downfall into barrenness. The hope of return remains distant, and regret comes too late.\n\nSome men indulge in beautiful women, and women cling to handsome men. Their unions are not with wives or concubines, nor with husbands or betrothed. Licentiousness disrupts propriety, and life and death deviate from the real. Failing to awaken and reform—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom is clear and luminous, neither deviant nor disordered. Thus, one ascends to the Three Clarities, the Purple Pole of the Jade Capital. The source of the ultimate Dao is reached through purity.\n\nAll beings containing qi are without ability or desire. Desires vary in depth, and matters differ in weight. Light transgressions involve contact; if unchecked, they become grave.\n\nIf one does not offend others, yet others offend, one must endure. Enduring with resentment and words unrelieved—this is not wisdom.\n\nWhen superiors and inferiors, inner and outer circles, transgress against one another, respond with a kind countenance and joyful demeanor. Use analogies and explanations, weeping and sorrow, scolding and threats—employ every expedient to halt the offense. Consider the provisional and the real, now guiding, now restraining. Avoid provoking anger, lest minor matters escalate. If the offense persists, it is due to deep karmic evil, unknown even to the sages. Compassionately refrain from blame, silently ashamed of being unable to stop it.\n\nTake care not to speak recklessly and expose the spirit. Wisdom may find itself powerless—this is such a case. Yet do not excessively shame or resent, abandoning the other without further regard. Nor should one fail to guard against failure, allowing others to act unchecked without compassionate aid—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom guards stillness and preserves the spirit, forgetting form and stabilizing qi. Qi flows without contention, and contention can be halted. Forgetting form while preserving the spirit allows admonitions to be heeded. But if one forgets the spirit while preserving form, seeking personal gain at others’ expense, others will not trust or follow. Instead, resentment grows, and calamity arises later—this is not wisdom.\n\nFor all undertakings, the beginning lies in the Dao. All other matters are coarse and peripheral. The peripheral may be abandoned, but the wondrous beginning must not be forsaken. Forsaking the wondrous to pursue the coarse—this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom arises in the mind, moves the mouth, and stirs the body. Practicing the Dao is the beginning; a good beginning ensures a good end. The end does not deviate from the beginning. Refining the mind daily, good conduct advances, and merit and virtue are ever renewed. Those unable to do so—this is not wisdom.\n\nIn establishing body and mind, align the mouth with thoughts of the Dao. Embrace the One to unify the myriad, practice weakness and honor softness. The rivers and seas contain much, thus they are lords of streams. Those who endure humiliation receive filth and become masters. Unable to bear hardship, discern right from wrong, or endure affliction—this is not wisdom.",

      "translated_text": "The wise discern no duality of destruction; self and other are one, right and wrong need not be debated, and if debated, one does not cling obstinately. Suffering and joy require no distinction, and if distinguished, no need to expound. In doing good, one does not boast; when slandered, one does not defend. Those whose minds differ from this are not wise.\n\nAll life receives life, and the living are most precious. To honor the Dao and revere the scriptures, to esteem the master—these form the Three Treasures, treasures of true and priceless worth. The Three must not be partial; partiality leads to stagnation, while completeness brings perfect harmony. Harmony enables salvation of the many, and the salvation of the many arises from the Three Honored Ones. The honored body becomes one, and the one responds to the three with resonance—now hidden, now manifest, now silent, now speaking, now interacting, now discoursing.\n\nThe Dao-Treasure is formless, hidden as the root of transformation. The scriptures bear written words, manifest as the beginning of teaching. The master has form and speech, whose comings and goings constitute the Dharma. Speech and silence follow the moment, but enduring presence is supreme.\n\nThe most essential teaching delivers countless beings. Reverently believe in the Three Treasures, cherish them steadfastly without forgetfulness. Through fasting and ritual, summon the spirits; uphold precepts and practice the Dao. Be cautious and unblemished, whole and unbroken. If broken or blemished, repent past transgressions and cultivate the future. Those who do not repeat their faults will surely attain deliverance. Those who do not believe, do not uphold, do not reform, do not repent—cannot attain deliverance and are not wise.\n\nUpon hearing the Great Dao, vow to practice diligently without cease, doing good without rest, diminishing the self to aid others. Those with literary or martial talent share their understanding with others. Those with courage and strength offer their labor to others. Those with power, rank, or wealth bestow honor and bounty upon others. Those lacking these three offer the goodness of their hearts to others—rejoicing when they see others’ good deeds and assisting them, grieving when they see others shun their duties and aiding them in sorrow. Though no immediate benefit may come to them, over time, resonance will arise. When others receive the blessings of praise and support, they themselves gain the reward of a joyful heart. This reward is like almsgiving, ever increasing without depletion. Thus, naturally, one acquires talent, strength, power, and rank.\n\nThose who lack these four offerings are not wise. The wise practice these four as the foundation of the Six Perfections. To study emptiness yet not be empty is the ultimate attainment of the sage. The ultimate is not empty emptiness; not empty, not empty—emptiness is utterly void. There is no \"having,\" yet \"having\" does not persist. There is no \"non-having,\" yet \"non-having\" is not absolute. \"Non-having\" transcends refinement and coarseness; \"having\" entails good and evil. Good and evil arise from \"having\" and \"non-having,\" which in turn give rise to one another. Refinement and coarseness take shape in contrast, yet one cannot fathom their ultimate nature—this is not wisdom.\n\nLucid and pure, radiant yet not dazzling, active when needed, withdrawn when appropriate—ordinary minds cannot fathom this. Rectify the mind and govern the body, restrain the mouth and guard stillness. The three karmas do not transgress; the Dao is fulfilled and the spirit complete. Floating and sinking at will, soaring with the six penetrations—this is called the Brahmanic practice, loftier than the mundane, ascending from earth to heaven. The Six Perfections crown the Brahmanic practice; the Seven Awakenings ascend to the Great Web. Neither lesser sages nor middling perfected ones can approach this, nor can the next rank of immortals and worthies attain it.\n\nAs for those of petty wisdom and great delusion, petty kindness and great confusion—clinging to non-being while grasping at being, harming one another—when the demonic comes to test them, they neither cross over nor awaken, thus falling into retrogression. This is not wisdom.\n\nThe wise and worthy advance with diligence, their merit and virtue surpassing all. They too may ascend to union, and in union, demons vanish. One must be resolute and courageous, attaining realization in a future life before the present one.

      "translated_text": "The Most High addressed the Azure Lad:\n\n\"The host of sages accumulate merit, and through karmic conditions attain fruition. When fruition reaches its apex and realization is complete, their wondrous forms transcend all comparison. Having delivered the thirty-six heavens, they thus possess the thirty-six marks. Having perfected the eighty-one grades, they thus possess the eighty-one excellences. Great perceptions all behold their full manifestation, while lesser perceptions receive partial responses—each appearing in greater or lesser measure, with the lesser concealing the greater. The common folk cannot perceive this.\n\nThus, the true bodies of the host of sages are without fixed form, yet their essential nature is constant, neither increasing nor diminishing. Few know this, and so it is uniquely prized. Yet for those who set their minds on learning, though their penetrating insight may not yet be complete, what they do perceive reveals wonders according to their understanding. Those who recognize the eyes and brows behold their eyes and brows as extraordinary; those who discern the nose and mouth perceive their nose and mouth as surpassing all. Thus, for each of the thirty-six marks, perception follows the clarity of one’s knowledge. When clarity reaches its apex and knowledge becomes all-encompassing, full illumination is attained.\n\nAll beings that contain qi share this principle, differing only in degree—some in abundance beyond measure, others in the barest minimum, even to the point of one. Yet even one remains unattainable, for this shared path is distant. Only through cultivation and refinement can one proceed. Refining the many returns them to the few; yet before the few are reduced to one, there remain thirty-six stages, each corresponding to a heaven. Each stage possesses a great distinction, and when these distinctions are unified, they reach the apex of the heavens. The apex of the thirty-six heavens converges in a single source.\n\nThus, the methods of convergence vary, each establishing its own teachings and techniques. The paths of the Dharma diverge, sometimes aligning, sometimes differing. The root of these differences lies in goodness. From one root, a single branch responds, forming the thirty-six. The three qi and three realms are all contained within. Form extends beyond, and beyond form, words are forgotten. Those who attain this in the thirty-six heavens—each of the thirty-six heavens possesses one—gain the most surpassing marks, which the Most High fully embodies.\n\nThe celestial beings of the heavens, the perfected, the immortals, the sages, and the divine—each possesses these marks in greater or lesser measure. Among worldly people, from emperors and kings to dukes and nobles, down to the common folk, each also possesses them in varying degrees. Some enjoy wealth and nobility yet die young; others live in poverty and lowliness yet attain long life. Some lack homes and dwellings yet have masters and lords; others possess palaces and mansions yet lack resources. Some amass treasures yet do not adorn themselves with robes and crowns; others indulge in fine food and adornment yet do not build houses. Some dwell beneath trees or in thatched huts yet gain fame and renown; others reside in splendid halls and fragrant gardens yet spread their fragrance far and wide. Some live in jade towers yet lack the Dao; others dwell in stone huts yet possess virtue. The threads of these variations are countless, their outcomes manifold.\n\nThe superior may engage in inferior affairs, while the inferior may pursue superior endeavors. Karmic conditions differ, and cultivation takes many forms. One must not disparage others, for disparagement harms perception. When the spirit of perception is fully awakened, it resides in the five virtues. When the five virtues are complete, all traces may be forgotten. Forgetting the traces, the traces remain—naturally manifesting the marks of excellence. When the thirty-six are fully possessed, one gains nobility, wealth, talent, and wisdom, along with majesty, radiance, and brilliance that surpass all others. Palaces and cities, jeweled canopies and bed curtains, fragrant flowers and music, attendants and guards, civil and martial aides, banners and drums—all resound in grandeur. Wind and clouds harmonize, movement and stillness align. The blazing light of the sun and moon, robes and crowns of myriad hues, a hundred harmonious flavors—body and speech abound in abundance. Whether needed or not, all is at ease and free. The supreme perfected and the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One, through accumulating learning and practicing goodness, ultimately attain this. Those who have not yet attained this remain bound to the turning wheel of birth and death, where suffering and joy, existence and non-existence alternate. If perception cannot penetrate this, stagnation leads to disorder, and disorder leads to falling into evil, with no return in sight. Only by turning toward goodness can one find the way back.\n\nNow, let those who study examine themselves closely: what do they possess, and what do they lack? Seek what is lacking, and do not cling to what is already possessed. Those who can provide for others will naturally attain what they lack. For those who have wealth but lack talent and understanding, it is fitting to practice generosity without stinginess, valuing the Dao over material goods. Their talent and understanding will then renew daily. For those who have dwellings but lack peace and well-being, it is fitting to welcome the worthy and the sagely, offering their homes to true immortals, without regret or attachment. Sorrows and troubles will then naturally dissolve. For those who have clothing and food but lack long life, it is fitting to reduce bodily comforts and share with enlightened teachers, seeking rare methods and practicing wondrous arts without slackening. They will surely secure extended life. For those who possess talent and wisdom but lack shelter and provisions, it is fitting to cultivate inner vision and secretly transform future lives, guiding all beings without claiming merit. Humility and concealment, without doubt in the heart, will draw the protection of divine spirits and the reverence of humans and ghosts. They will naturally gain vast dwellings, heavenly palaces, and blessed halls, with extraordinary clothing and food, and attendants adorned in splendor.\n\nMatters such as these can be extended to all things, each manifesting in its own way, and need not be exhaustively recorded. The enlightened grasp this: abandoning the existent to seek the non-existent, one need not necessarily attain the non-existent. Attaining the non-existent lies in non-stagnation, and non-stagnation lies in non-attachment. To give when sought is to be without fixation—this is non-stagnation, not abandonment. Though one may not seek, if attachment to possession causes distress, discarding it for others is called abandonment, not non-stagnation. To abandon this for that is to stagnate in the non-existence of this—this is not the Dao. To give when sought, though I do not cling, may bring calamity to the recipient—this is coarse non-stagnation, also not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao does not stagnate in subtlety. Subtlety lies in illumination. My abandonment causes no loss, while the recipient gains benefit—this is the Dao, the way of the wise. In giving, there are many ways—what is fitting and what is not. To give fittingly is wisdom; to give unfittingly is folly. Folly lies in giving that contradicts wisdom.\n\nWhen others come seeking from me, I weigh the truth or falsity of their request. If false, they test me; if true, they rely on me. Those who rely may be good or evil; those who test may be coarse or refined. Coarse tests are to be shattered and destroyed; refined tests are to be declined with courtesy. To decline with courtesy is the way of the sagely teacher.\n\nWhen good spirits test me with affairs, if I lack wondrous virtue, if my virtue is not yet complete, they come to test me now. With keen perception and clear intent, I already know and understand, free from confusion. Thus, I decline with this—this is wisdom.\"",

      "translated_text": "To shatter them is to confront the Five Demons and Three Poisons, who test through transformations. When my arts remain obscure and my power untrusted, I govern them—punishing, reproving, and subduing—until they submit. To vanquish demonic adversaries is wisdom.\n\nThose who falter in testing, seized by terror, hesitation, or confusion, fail to transcend—such are not the wise. Those unwise may fall into demonic factions, yet if they awaken to the snares of the perverse and extricate themselves, returning from deviation to rectitude, steadfast in resolve without retreat—neither rejoicing in praise nor grieving at slander—dissolving ills with method, dispelling them with principle, and setting aside censure and acclaim without concern, they cultivate the true Dao, their virtue unflagging. When slander naturally subsides, this is wisdom.\n\nWhen others assail with offense, do not reckon or retaliate. Speak rightly when words are fitting; otherwise, remain silent. Inwardly discern the spirit’s path, silently relinquishing the impulse to strike back. When assaults cease of themselves, harbor no thought of requital—such a mind, free of vengeance, sees virtue daily ascend.\n\nThough evil men despise them, they cannot inflict harm; instead, the harm rebounds upon themselves. One pities their folly, lamenting that their malice finds no outlet. Such a heart is wisdom.\n\nAll violent men—rebellious and lawless—may interrogate the Dao, mock virtue, revile heaven and earth, defame parents, slander masters and lords, envy kin and friends, or slander the good. Yet to endure, suffer wrong without anger, persist in explanation without contention, and hold the Dao steadfast in the heart—this is wisdom.\n\nTo rage in self-justification, redress wrongs at others’ expense, seek fame through death, or indulge wrath without regard for life, dying unrepentant or deepening karmic entanglements—this is not wisdom.\n\nAgainst all evil men, fierce birds, venomous beasts, stinging insects, and poisonous creatures, one must guard. Without skill in defense, or with shallow arts that fail to repel, if past enmity runs deep while present merit is slight, retribution will surely come. Yet when it arrives, do not abandon the Dao. Know it as the fruition of past sins, and bear no resentment. Today’s suffering is the reckoning of old debts. Dissolve the causes and conditions without malice, even when violence is inflicted.\n\nAt first, their intent—light or grave—remains unclear. Employ methods: persuasion, incantations, vows, and varied explanations, striving to prevent mutual harm. Even if forced to wield blades or threats to drive them away, never kill or harm, lest enmity deepen. When all arts fail to repel, accept partial ruin to settle past debts, without harboring thoughts of retaliation. Preserve the Dao, seeking future liberation—this is wisdom.\n\nThose sharp yet impoverished, dull yet prosperous, kind yet short-lived, deceitful yet long-lived, innocent yet afflicted, guilty yet at ease—all receive precise karmic retribution, without the slightest deviation. The perceptive understand; the benighted doubt. Doubt cannot be dispelled, nor can understanding be sought—this is not wisdom.\n\nThe wise harbor no doubt; the doubtless possess insight. They discern the thirty-six heavens and earths, master the thirty-six sublime practices, and intone the thirty-six true tones—thus, all demons vanish.\n\nThe Three Corpses are most malevolent, known as the Three Poisons, which harm human life. They must be swiftly eradicated. By guarding the One with single-minded devotion, the Three Corpses self-destruct.\n\nThe One has no form, no desire, no action. Hard to attain, easy to lose—loss stems from dim perception, inability to advance in clarity, and the heart’s entanglement in craving. Thus, decline and aging arise. Joy and anger invite illness; delusion, if uncorrected, brings death. Anger and aging are prolonged by the Three Corpses.\n\nTo heal, preserve, and protect, first guard the One. Without the One, nothing succeeds; without the One, nothing is achieved. Guard the One in tranquility, the mind serene and seeking, curbing desire and restraining power. Turn from delusion to truth, vast and desireless, uniting with the One—this is the highest of the high, achieved through lifelong accumulation.\n\nThose of middling rank and above, though their goodness is not yet perfected, ascend gradually. They must attend to the Three Origins, discerning the spirit and qi, their forms, names, and movements—presence and absence, governing the Three Palaces. Thus, the Three Corpses fall away. The Three Origins are wondrous, yet not instantly mastered. Cultivate goodness diligently, perfect the Five Virtues, accumulate myriad merits daily. Then, a thousand demons dare not assail. With the Corpses’ poisons gone, darkness refines into light. Wisdom and spiritual penetration arise, bestowing immortality.\n\nThe sacred and true immortals reap the fruits of their causes, ascending the mysterious and transforming the world, following the cycles of departure and return. They measure others by measuring themselves, observing body and all things—all bearing verification. Examine closely: correct errors, uphold what is right. Through fasting, stillness, contemplation, ingesting herbs and talismans, reciting petitions and vows, doubt yields to certainty. Free from greed and desire, they neither decline nor age. The aged revert to youth, body and spirit radiant. Free from joy and anger, they know no illness or misfortune. Misfortune is overcome, illness cured, qi strong and flourishing. Free from delusion and envy, they neither die nor perish. Though seeming to perish, they do not. With right vision and no deviation, they commune with others and unite with the Dao. The One merges with the One—thus are they called sacred and true immortals.\n\nIf desires cannot be diminished, decline cannot be averted, anger cannot be dispelled, illness cannot be cured, folly cannot be transformed, or death cannot be escaped—mere claims of Dao cultivation are false and vain. Such vain pretenders ultimately fall into demonic factions, causing worldly illusions to arise: false names, pretenses of being the Most High or sacred immortals, feigned divine transformations to delude all. Without true learning, who can rectify this?\n\nTo transform the perverse and preserve the true, guard the One and illuminate the Three. Practice the Five and perfect the Six—those of the Six Penetrations harbor no falsity. In movement and stillness, all is real. Though employing expedient transformations, they ultimately rely on the true Dao.\n\nThe work of the true Dao knows no sorrow or illness, no death—only eternal life. Teaching tirelessly, they master ancient and modern texts at a glance, discerning truth from falsehood, weighing subtleties, exposing flaws and errors, clarifying ambiguities. Their explanations are settled and lucid, resolving doubts. Applying scriptures yields solemn verification. Their speech is flawless, their writings unburdened. Their pure discourse moves heaven; their compositions outshine the sun. Pen in hand, they compose chapters, extolling the profound. Whether scriptures, commentaries, precepts, or disciplines—whether admonitions, odes, contracts, memorials, petitions, or decrees—whether chapters, petitions, confessions, or vows—whether formulas, talismans, records, or registers—whether few or many, elaborate or simple, plain or ornate, refined or unadorned, shallow or deep—they adapt teachings to circumstances. Their conduct varies, their appearances differ, their concealments and revelations diverge.",

When utterances are set into writing, there are separations and exchanges, excesses and advantages, each fitting its truth with aptness.\n\nThose of single penetration cannot refine a hundred characters; those of double penetration leave a thousand words unaltered; those of triple penetration find ten thousand characters not obscure; those of quadruple penetration see a hundred thousand as unchanging; those of quintuple penetration regard a million as unbound; those of sextuple penetration mark a thousand million without blemish. Beyond these, responses to change are inexhaustible.\n\nWithout these six kinds of people, one cannot engage in composition. Only they may compile and transmit, emulating the ancients. All must be verified by citation, following the counsels of former sages. Take care not to rely on one’s own breast and speak from mere opinion. Though one may speak from the heart, if the heart has not attained thorough penetration, it does not enter the true Dharma. All such are called heterodox writings, which soon perish of themselves and do not long circulate. Only those six kinds of people ensure endless dissemination, whether hidden or revealed, never to be extinguished.\n\nLater learners, diligently study this principle. If you have not yet equaled the six, do not force yourself to write. In vain you will labor heart and mind, mocked by men and spirits, offending the numinous powers. Then you will suffer severe torment, the wind-knife’s agonizing pain enduring for kalpas without relief.\n\nDo not pursue empty fame or lightly compose in reckless abandon. Reckless composition brings misfortune—clearly recognize this and be cautious.\n\nAll acts, whether beneficial or not, whether advantageous or not—acting or non-acting, acting yet not for oneself, oneself acting yet not for oneself, oneself acting for things, acting for the sake of things, acting yet not acting, non-acting yet acting, acting as non-acting—\n\nFor those who act as non-acting, resentment and slander do not arise. If they arise, they do not harm oneself. The other brings calamity upon themselves; calamity befalls them. Pity them, grieve for them, think of them and aid them. Do not indulge, yet do not restrain; do not restrain, yet do not indulge. Rescue them with every means. If means cannot save them, if salvation is beyond their capacity—this remains perpetually fortunate, while they sink into misfortune. Their misfortune is not yours; your fortune is not sought, yet comes of itself. Self-arriving is not misfortune—it is natural good fortune. Those who do not know this good fortune are not wise.\n\nIf others are angry with me and I am angry in return, even if I do not retaliate, yet fail to guard against it, I sit by while their transgression deepens, bringing grave disaster upon myself. Grave disaster follows unnoticed; blindly trusting in one’s own conduct, calamity spreads unpredictably. Unable to avoid it—this is not wisdom.\n\nOne who can teach others must first be capable oneself. Teaching others brings benefit; benefiting oneself and others, do not benefit where there is no benefit. Benefit without benefit is called harm; harming the false benefits the true.\n\nThe true person teaches others without selfishly keeping goodness for oneself. One’s own goodness is the goodness of others; the goodness of oneself and others is the same. Refining goodness leads to truth; accomplishing the true Dao, slander and humiliation do not come. If they come, they cause no harm. There is no doubt in judgment—doubt is not wisdom.\n\nWhen slanderous rumors spread, do not retaliate or overturn. Explain with skillful means, pleasing without anger. Both parties rejoice, doubts and reproaches disperse like clouds. Following one’s nature and insisting on being right, disregarding others’ concerns—though one may meet the mark, one cannot embrace the vast. Partial beauty bears injury—this is not wisdom.\n\nThose without wisdom are daily tested by demons, with no way to obtain the thirty-six divine mushrooms, no means to bear the thirty-six marks of fruition, unable to manifest the eighty-one excellences. They cannot dissolve the multitude of demons; their spiritual power remains incomplete. They must not presumptuously ascend the Dao altar. Ascending the Dao dissolves demons—first, wisdom must be established.\n\nThe Azure Youth bows his head, receives, and pledges to practice.\n\n*Wondrous True Supreme Speaks the Scripture on Wisdom Dissolving Demons, Scroll Four concludes*\n\n*Wondrous True Supreme Speaks the Scripture on Wisdom Dissolving Demons, Scroll Five*\n*Chapter on Transformations*\n\nThe Supreme addressed the Lord of the Golden Portal: \"Of the countless multitudes, every feeling elicits a response. Evil is originally present, existing yet not at its extreme. Though there may be slight goodness, it is not wondrous goodness. Thinking of evil, evil responds—originally present, they incline toward one another.\n\nGoodness is originally absent, non-existent yet not yet arisen. Abandoning that coarse evil, one thinks of this wondrous goodness. Wondrous goodness responds to goodness—originally absent, now arising.\n\nOriginal absence is the Dao; the Dao responds only to goodness. Goodness has great and small, yet none is evil. Original presence is the mundane; the mundane responds only to evil. Evil has great and small, yet none is good.\n\nThus, for those who do evil, though the Dao seeks to save them, the deeply deluded do not turn back. Not turning back, they fall into evil—beyond what wisdom can do. For those who do good, though the mundane may attack them, the steadfast and upright do not waver. Not wavering, they accomplish goodness—this is what wisdom can cultivate and establish.\n\nCultivation and establishment begin with the One. The One generates yin and yang. Supreme harmony spreads qi, containing essence and nurturing spirit. Spirit and qi are most wondrous, without beginning or end, without bounds or shores, without top or bottom, without center or interval, without place yet not nothing.\n\nWhere there is place, all exists, yet existence cannot know it. Those who know possess wisdom—the people of the Supreme.\n\nThe people of the Supreme embody this wondrous wisdom, clearly guarding the One. Their application does not overflow. Profound and still, they are the ancestral host; their traces respond according to their portion. Depending on what is received, there are greater and lesser wisdoms.\n\nWhy is this so? Wisdom is an external name; wondrous qi is the inner reality. Reality does not depart from the nameless; names are provisional combinations. Gathering the branches to return to the root, drawing the false back to the true—the true within has no false; responses without may depart, then return again.\n\nNames have egress and ingress. Inwardly, they are the heart-spirit; outwardly, they are conduct and deeds. Deeds have regulations and laws, scriptural teachings and written words. Following and disseminating them, applying them with reliance on a teacher—beginning and end without deficiency—this is called merit and virtue.\n\nMerit and virtue are accomplished through the five spirits: the liver’s hun-soul, the lungs’ po-soul, the spleen’s intent, the kidneys’ essence, and the heart’s spirit. These mutually require one another, clearly understanding without opposition. Harmonizing and aligning in sequence, the Three Ones remain.\n\nRetaining the One unifies the five; the six penetrations reside in the body. Body and spirit are both one, entering the gate of non-duality. The heart is the master of conduct; conduct returns to the heart-spirit.

      "translated_text": "The One pervades the cavernous void; in the void’s expanse, there is no limit. Nothing is not contained; nothing is not possessed. Within, it is truly nameless; without, it is called wisdom.\n\nWisdom marks the source and gathers the currents. The wise know the return; the enlightened are without delusion. Without delusion, one enters samādhi. Response and resonance leave nothing unanswered; the slightest good is surely aided, merit is surely assisted, virtue is surely flourishing, cause is surely followed by effect. This effect enters samādhi, transforming and adapting as is fitting.\n\nTo know samādhi yet not abide in it, to comprehend the Dharma yet not cultivate it—cultivating without verification, exhausting effort without attainment—mere words without substance: this is not wisdom.\n\nWisdom establishes virtue and merit, follows methods and applies techniques, is meticulous and precise, preserves the Dao and relies on the scriptures, seeks verification from a teacher. Though long without sign, one redoubles devotion, practices without ceasing, and naturally achieves success.\n\nThough methods and arts are many, the essential lies in but a little: first, preserve the Dao and guard the One. The One Dao, the One heart—let the heart hold no dual thought. Present conduct is without flaw. Ingesting talismans, reciting incantations, counting breaths, pacing steps—what is cultivated with single-mindedness will surely be verified.\n\nYet verification does not endure, for precision is lacking. Refine it further, refine it again—within it lies certainty. The decisive certainty is as follows; guard it closely and do not recklessly disclose it.\n\nThe wise superior adept practices these Three Guards, dispelling demonic adversaries, vanquishing ghostly thieves, subduing evil persons, warding off baleful qi, dispelling sorrow and curing illness, protecting against warfare. Water and fire cannot encroach; myriad calamities cannot assail. One roams beyond the Three Realms, feasts in the palace of the Queen Mother, meets in succession the sovereigns of Great Peace, and has one’s name entered in the register of the Seed People. Ascending as an immortal, one attains the highest rank of the imperial hierarchy, forever uniting with the Dao, transformations without end—such is the wondrous efficacy of wisdom, the essential secret of all sages.\n\nThe Golden Portal’s Holy Emperor bows his head and reverently practices.\n\n*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the* Wondrous Scripture of Supreme Purity on Wisdom’s Dispelling of Demons.",
      "overlap_context": "oul, the spleen’s intent, the kidneys’ essence, and the heart’s spirit. These mutually require one another, clearly understanding without opposition. Harmonizing and aligning in sequence, the Three Ones remain.\n\nRetaining the One unifies the five; the six penetrations reside in the body. Body and spirit are both one, entering the gate of non-duality. The heart is the master of conduct; conduct returns to the heart-spirit. Spirit and penetration are non-dual, embracing the One without departure.\"",
