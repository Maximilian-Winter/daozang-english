Through the practice of the Dao, prostration, and repentance, we seek to avert calamities, cure illnesses, dispel misfortune, and invoke blessings.\n\nMay the Supreme One bestow compassion, and may the hosts of heaven show mercy. We pray that the overseers of the ten directions, the Great Brahmā Deva-King, the demon-slaying officers and soldiers, the disaster-dispelling vajra-warriors, all descend upon this ritual seat and assemble in this Daoist sanctuary. On behalf of the retreat sponsor, may they capture and expel demonic spirits, drive away malevolent ghosts, and swiftly sever the manifold disasters wrought by Gou Yingzi and his followers. May they uphold the retreat sponsor, curing all ailments and dissolving a thousand misfortunes. May they extend lifespan, elevate rank and emolument, deliver the nine generations of ancestors to ascension, and liberate the seven lineages to bliss. May the entire household dwell in peace and stability, and may all—noble and base—enjoy health and prosperity. May all wishes be fulfilled, and may we look up in gratitude to the mysterious grace.\n\n**Incantation:**\nIn the Eastern Direction, the Venerable Lord of Azure,\nWhose name is the Numinous Gou Mang.\nYou roam the vast heavens,\nBrushing the Jade Capital with azure hues.\nThe Great Vehicle encompasses the Three Heavens,\nWhile the host of perfected ones commands demonic legions.\nThe eight tones resound through the ten lands,\nAs nine dragons draw your cloud-borne chariot.\nEstablishing the retreat, you achieve great merit,\nIlluminating the long night with radiance.\nThe drum of the true Dao resounds,\nAnd all demonic forces crumble and fall.\nThe Demon King bows in submission,\nDaring not test you—his form is obliterated.\nBenevolent spirits guard the gates,\nWhile vajra-warriors marshal the myriad spirits.\nThe qi of the Dao flows widely,\nAnd all kin dwell in peace.\nPlagues and poisons vanish entirely,\nAnd the myriad people attain long life.\nTogether we propagate the supreme Dao,\nAnd ascend to the Purple Phoenix City.\n\n**The Southern Direction**\n\nWe, your humble servants, reverently establish for the retreat’s sponsor, so-and-so and company, the Great Retreat of the Wondrous Spell of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi. We perform the Dao-circuits and prostration-repentances to heal afflictions and calamities, to invoke blessings and beseech grace. May the Great Sage extend vast compassion, and may the host of perfected ones bestow their protection. Dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers and Valiant Warriors, the Red-Killing Celestial Troops, to seize and expel demonic plagues, to annihilate the Nine Sons of the Scorched Clan and all who bring forth afflictions and calamities. May all misfortunes be gathered, their poisons and essences captured, each returned to their proper place. Thus shall the retreat’s sponsors find their illnesses healed, their souls and spirits purified and at peace. May their lifespans be extended, their ranks and emoluments advanced. May their departed ancestors and forebears be freed from the dark paths. May the entire household enjoy peace and well-being, high and low alike, steadfast and auspicious.

We perform the Dao-circuits and prostration-repentances to heal illnesses, dispel misfortune, and eradicate calamities and malevolence. We humbly beseech the Five Thearchic Divine Honored Ones, the Lesser Yin host of sages, to extend their vast compassion and mercy, to look upon our earnest prayers with favor. May they dispatch the Great Soldiers of the Nine Heavens, the Red-Killing Valiant Warriors, to seize and expel Xinling, the Red Crow specters, the spirits of the living and the dead, the ghosts of tombs and graves, the followers of Wunu Liuzi and their ilk.
