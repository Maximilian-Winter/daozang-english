  "full_translation": "**The Danjia Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Danjia Collection*\n**Original Author:** Attributed to Zhao Min, the Perfected One Who Descended to Truth of Western Qin; likely composed during the Song dynasty.\n**Volume:** One.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition* (Zhengtong Daozang), Supreme Mystery Section (Taixuan Bu), category of Various Arts.\n\n---\n\n### *The Danjia Collection*\n**By Zhao Min, the Perfected One Who Descended to Truth of Western Qin**\n\nIf a seeker wishes to grasp the principle of longevity,\nExamine closely and delve deep into the source of the Great Dao.\nOnce you comprehend the Crimson Dragon coiled in the Black Sea,\nYou must then unite the White Tiger beyond the Vermilion Carriage.\n\nThe Five Phases converge within the realm of golden elixir,\nAfter nine revolutions, they return to the gate of the Purple Palace.\nHaving glimpsed the immortal’s realm within,\nIt is fitting to swiftly guide your descendants.\n\nWith diligent heart, longing for the Way of the Inaudible and Invisible,\nYou may indeed encounter a true person who points to the sprouting Dao.\nRecognizing the handle of the Jade Tree in Kan and Li,\nLet the beasts harness the River Chariot as they will.\n\nTiger and Dragon mate within the chamber of spirit,\nAs time and sun cycle, forming the precious flower.\nAfter seven reversals and nine returns, the work complete,\nYou need but consume a single grain to dwell among immortals.\n\nWithdrawing as a scholar, blending with the dust,\nRoaming everywhere, delighting in celestial truth.\nWith sincere heart, you may chance upon the fruit beyond the mundane,\nCultivating the Dao, you clearly know the cause of abiding in the world.\n\nWithin the black womb, the phoenix marrow is gathered,\nBetween the two bowstrings, the immortal guest is nurtured.\nWhen the numbers of yin and yang are fulfilled, the elixir forms—\nThen you become a dweller within the immortal’s grotto.\n\nOf solitary spirit and lofty art,\nYou traverse the ends of the earth, yet few are your Dao-companions.\nIf you can make the sun’s essence dwell in the moon’s marrow,\nAnd harmonize the yin numbers with the yang lines,\n\nTempering the cauldron with ordinary fire,\nSealing the furnace to nurture the sacred embryo,\nWhen the nine nines are complete, the time is ripe—\nThe hound transforms into a dragon upon receiving the elixir.\n\nIf even the mortal bones are no longer difficult to refine,\nThe intermingling of Metal and Wood holds the profoundest principle.\nEmbrace the Golden Crow and bring it to the Northern Sea,\nFollow the Jade Hare as it crosses the autumn sky.\n\nWith the Three Powers complete, aided by lofty grace,\nIn a hundred days, the medicine’s power is perfected.\nFrequent ingestion naturally extends the years,\nThough the vast sea may turn to fields.\n\nWithin non-action lies action, beyond action is the action of the sage.\nRecognizing Kan and Li as above and below,\nLet the Crow and Hare roam east and west as they will.\n\nThe elixir transforms tiles and pebbles into treasures,\nThe aged elixir reverses the knife and measure, returning one to youth.\nThis Dao is subtle and few comprehend it,\nIts hidden meaning resides within the characters themselves.\n\nHaving attained the Dao, depart from Qin,\nWildly exulting, chanting as a purified one.\nYin and yang activate to advance others’ work,\nLead and mercury are gathered to sustain one’s own body.\n\nDo not wonder at the repeated inducements of loyal words,\nFor fleeting moments may slip past unnoticed.\nIf you can refine and ingest the immortal’s medicine,\nIt will not hinder you from serving as a great minister in a pure dynasty.\n\nIf you seek the land of longevity and deathlessness,\nRefine jia and geng to become the king of medicines.\nYou will command yin ghosts to transform with the insects,\nAnd assist the yang spirit to prolong life.\n\nFear not the seas overturning or mountains crumbling,\nWhy worry that the body will decay and the temples turn gray?\nDiligently and early, wish for others to awaken with you,\nLest delay bring calamity.\n\nHaving awakened to emptiness, trust in its reality,\nWith wisdom and discernment, you can resolve what is hard to fathom.\nThe Dragon, clad in jia Wood, ascends to lofty transformation,\nThe Tiger, crouching in geng Metal, hides within the northern womb.\n\nWithin the lines of the Eight Trigrams, the Four Images are distinguished,\nIn the Nine Heavens’ palace, the Three Terraces are aligned.\nFrom mortal to sage, all proceed by this,\nTo gather the jade gem from the cold palace.\n\nThough you exhaust ten thousand immortal scriptures with careful intent,\nWithout encountering the true formula, your efforts are in vain.\nThe Dragon soars to the azure void, the golden cavern on high,\nThe Tiger flees to the mysterious womb, toward the palace of Kan.\n\nYou may question all the world, yet few will comprehend,\nLamenting that the determined scholar has not yet penetrated the mystery.\nTurn your heart early to recognize being within non-being,\nLest the years, swift as the wind, pass you by.\n\nWhat is so extraordinary about a single grain of cinnabar?\nIt can transmute a feeble frame into a stalwart man.\nSeizing the primal transformation of heaven and earth,\nSwallowing it, the viscera shed their withering and flourishing.\n\nWhen yin wanes and simplicity is restored, the common folk marvel,\nWhen yang waxes and purity returns, the sages rejoice.\nThe divine immortals of antiquity ingested this medicine,\nAnd no other method reveals the void.\n\nThe world does not recognize the gold within water,\nHaving perused all elixir scriptures, the principle runs deepest.\nExhaust Kan and Li to know whether fortune or misfortune prevails,\nOnly then will mao and you rise and sink of themselves.\n\nTo return to the Purple Palace, first follow bing,\nTo gather the jasper flower, it emerges from ren.\nThe verses speak plainly of the wondrous formula—\nSeek no further elsewhere.\n\nThe scene within the gourd is known to few,\nThose who know are not deluded, those who comprehend are rare.\nDo not point to the immortal scriptures, expecting self-realization,\nYou must rely on oral transmission to dispel error.\n\nTo prolong life, you must depend on the power of the Mysterious Pearl,\nRefining the medicine, you probe the mechanism of creation.\nFrequent ingestion of a single pill dispels yin ghosts,\nAnd with utmost yang, the light body soars into the void.\n\nThe accumulated virtue of ancestors may bequeath immortality,\nFor encountering the returning elixir, the power is attested in the text.\nMetal and Water intermingle, returning to wu and ji,\nWhen the numbers of yin and shen are fulfilled, the years revolve.\n\nOpening the furnace, five hues illuminate the chamber of spirit,\nEntering the abdomen, the three hun return to the Grotto Heaven.\nGrasp the hidden meaning within these verses—\nSeek not the true explanation elsewhere.\n\nYin is gathered, yang is received, in accord with the lines,\nHarmonized and placed in the crucible, Tiger and Dragon unite.\nWhen the Dragon meets the Tiger, it is like a jackal before a hound,\nWhen the Tiger encounters the Dragon, it is like a sparrow before a cat.\n\nSeven times they shift, dwelling in the sacred realm,\nOnce they bathe, the divine embryo stirs.\nThe numinous elixir skillfully transforms the mortal body,\nAs the parrot becomes a phoenix, nesting in the phoenix’s abode.\n\nThere is another reason for refining the immortal elixir,\nThe true formulas of past and present align in principle.\nAll speak of ren and zi driving the Golden Tiger,\nAll tell of the Azure Lad gathering the Fire Ox.\n\nMorning departs, evening returns, circling the canopy of heaven,\nSun comes, moon goes, revolving through spring and autumn.\nOnly then do you know how difficult it is to enter this gate—\nAwait the slaying of the adept to inquire of the Dao’s true stream.\n\nWithout encountering the true explanation, the principle is not refined,\nYour spirit’s labor is in vain, as if entangled.\nOnce the Red Child departs the mysterious chamber,\nYou must send the Yellow Dame to cherish the Purple Essence.\n\nIf the blackness errs even slightly, the spirit scatters,\nThough the six lines are complete, the medicine is hard to form.\nI urge you: best to diligently refine and ingest,\nFor once ingested, the spirit is whole and the body naturally light.\n\nThe high office of the Kan position is known to few,\nThose who know do not speak of it as the foundation of the Dao.\nThe mother of gui rides the White Horse child,\nThe elder of ding loves to nurture the Black Tortoise son.\n\nWithin a thousand days, you will attend the Yellow Lord,\nBeyond the twelve towers, the Purple Curtain awaits.\nDo not wonder that these words are so resplendent—\nIn due time, the years will incline.\n\nCarrying the lute, bearing wine, the Dao harmonizes,\nCarefully reckon: how much is a human life?\nWhen joy comes, seize joy;\nWhere time slips by, let it slip.\n\nIf in water you see the infant’s face,\nIn fire you should hear the old woman’s surprise.\nRefinement can but extend the span of years—\nLet the sun and moon race swift as shuttles.\n\nIn the depths of the northern darkness lurks the spinning fish;\nHook it and bring it to pair with the moon’s debt.\nLead it into the Yellow Palace to attend the sacred gate,\nPlant it in the Purple Mansion to grow as immortal greens.\n\nBones hard as jade, the countenance unchanged,\nBowels transformed to sinew, nature returns to the origin.\nThe yin region naturally erases its name,\nThe yang spirit refuses to follow the three chariots.\n\nHaving gathered the cold jade medicine from the Celestial Pool,\nIf you teach the lofty maiden, she will rejoice.\nTogether you enter the Spring Lord’s canopy,\nThen ascend in order to the Crimson Emperor’s altar.\n\nWithin a hundred marks, the cycle of jia-zi is complete;\nWithin ten thousand days, the divine elixir is wrought.\nThe multitude who encounter it become immortal guests—\nSwallows and sparrows that feed on it turn to phoenixes and simurghs.\n\nCultivate virtue day by day, and you will meet the true elder;\nAll empty and nonexistent principles are spoken to the full.\nOnce you grasp the immortals’ lead-mercury secret,\nYou will surely know the world’s profit and fame are hollow.\n\nPiling gold and amassing jade cannot compare;\nTo ferry sons and extend grandsons is but a burdensome merit.\nHow can it lie in gazing at stars or worshipping the moon?\nOnly when the Dao is perfected does one manifest the ancient green passage.\n\nDeluded disciples do not recognize the gold within water,\nVainly seeking it at the ends of the earth and shores of the sea.\nKnow that black lead becomes the supreme treasure,\nAnd cinnabar mercury naturally forms a forest of cold.\n\nThe Azure Lad sings palace-mode melodies,\nThe Kan Mother plucks the zhi-mode zither.\nInvite them into the pot to feast together—\nDay and night, joy resounds like jade dragons singing.\n\nThe *Yin Fu* and *Dao De* reveal the mysterious mechanism,\nEvery line and verse speaks to the full.\nThe mother, having raised the child, is to be cherished;\nWhile white remains, do not act upon the black.\n\nFire gives birth to xun-wood, returning to the fruit;\nWater enters the lofty village, reversing to the good foundation.\nThough the world’s methods are boundless,\nNone but the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is profoundly profound;\nThe aspirant’s encounter accords with heaven’s design.\nThe blended forms of things all arise from Kan,\nThe root of transformation lies entirely in Qian.\n\nEach time you refine cinnabar, the spirit is at ease;\nFeeding on the purple medicine, the body is serene.\nEight thousand one hundred and three years—\nNot to become an earthbound immortal in the dusty world.\n\nThe true person skillfully gathers the jasper blossoms,\nMaking mercury a kin and uniting with the broken caltrop.\nThe Four Images fully return to the Yellow Realm,\nThe Five Directions are wholly named the Purple River Chariot.\n\nTo transform the decaying husk into a sturdy body,\nTo nourish the withered root and sprout tender shoots—\nThis is the method of the King of Huainan,\nWho carried his chickens and dogs to the immortal’s home.\n\nHaving refined the immortal elixir amidst the world,\nWithout meeting the true formula, one vainly dwells in the mountains.\nWho knows that the myriad things share the same Dao?\nHow can one believe in the three peaks uniting the two passes?\n\nThe black infant displays a jade countenance,\nThe Lady of the Nine Palaces wears a golden visage.\nBecause of that small measure in former days,\nEven now my temples bear no frost.\n\nThe golden elixir that enters the mouth—what labor is there?\nIt suffuses the four limbs, harmonizing and unblocking the qi.\nTransforming form and changing bones, becoming a true child,\nReversing age and halting the years, becoming a youth.\n\nTo gather the red maiden within yang,\nTo match her with the white-headed elder within yin—\nThereby eternally preserving boundless longevity,\nHow could the vulgar know of such merit?\n\nAmong the four great elements of the realm, the Dao comes first;\nHow can scant fortune comprehend mercury and lead?\nDo not believe that drawing out lead makes the great medicine—\nThey merely speak of burning mercury to supplement the cinnabar field.\n\nDeluded disciples often lose their way in the world,\nWhile the awakened repeatedly attain immortality.\nSince ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s method—\nHaving refined the nine tripods, he ascended to heaven.\n\nVainly seeking others, yet finding no one,\nHow many times has brooding harmed the spirit?\nThough you know all will gradually turn to dust,\nStill you zealously cling to treasures.\n\nOne method encompasses a thousand myriad affairs;\nA few pellets can sustain a hundred springs.\nThe poem early wished for shared awakening—\nDo not trust that there will be another cause in the next life.\n\nThe *Dan Jia Ji* is complete.",

follow the three chariots.\n\nHaving gathered the cold jade medicine from the Celestial Pool,\nIf you teach the lofty maiden, she will rejoice.\nTogether you enter the Spring Lord’s canopy,\nThen ascend in order to the Crimson Emperor’s altar.\n\nWithin a hundred marks, the cycle of jia-zi is complete;\nWithin ten thousand days, the divine elixir is wrought.\nThe multitude who encounter it become immortal guests—\nSwallows and sparrows that feed on it turn to phoenixes and simurghs.\n\nCultivate virtue day by day, and you will meet the true elder;\nAll empty and nonexistent principles are spoken to the full.\nOnce you grasp the immortals’ lead-mercury secret,\nYou will surely know the world’s profit and fame are hollow.\n\nPiling gold and amassing jade cannot compare;\nTo ferry sons and extend grandsons is but a burdensome merit.\nHow can it lie in gazing at stars or worshipping the moon?\nOnly when the Dao is perfected does one manifest the ancient green passage.\n\nDeluded disciples do not recognize the gold within water,\nVainly seeking it at the ends of the earth and shores of the sea.\nKnow that black lead becomes the supreme treasure,\nAnd cinnabar mercury naturally forms a forest of cold.\n\nThe Azure Lad sings palace-mode melodies,\nThe Kan Mother plucks the zhi-mode zither.\nInvite them into the pot to feast together—\nDay and night, joy resounds like jade dragons singing.\n\nThe *Yin Fu* and *Dao De* reveal the mysterious mechanism,\nEvery line and verse speaks to the full.\nThe mother, having raised the child, is to be cherished;\nWhile white remains, do not act upon the black.\n\nFire gives birth to xun-wood, returning to the fruit;\nWater enters the lofty village, reversing to the good foundation.\nThough the world’s methods are boundless,\nNone but the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is profoundly profound;\nThe aspirant’s encounter accords with heaven’s design.\nThe blended forms of things all arise from Kan,\nThe root of transformation lies entirely in Qian.\n\nEach time you refine cinnabar, the spirit is at ease;\nFeeding on the purple medicine, the body is serene.\nEight thousand one hundred and three years—\nNot to become an earthbound immortal in the dusty world.\n\nThe true person skillfully gathers the jasper blossoms,\nMaking mercury a kin and uniting with the broken caltrop.\nThe Four Images fully return to the Yellow Realm,\nThe Five Directions are wholly named the Purple River Chariot.\n\nTo transform the decaying husk into a sturdy body,\nTo nourish the withered root and sprout tender shoots—\nThis is the method of the King of Huainan,\nWho carried his chickens and dogs to the immortal’s home.\n\nHaving refined the immortal elixir amidst the world,\nWithout meeting the true formula, one vainly dwells in the mountains.\nWho knows that the myriad things share the same Dao?\nHow can one believe in the three peaks uniting the two passes?\n\nThe black infant displays a jade countenance,\nThe Lady of the Nine Palaces wears a golden visage.\nBecause of that small measure in former days,\nEven now my temples bear no frost.\n\nThe golden elixir that enters the mouth—what labor is there?\nIt suffuses the four limbs, harmonizing and unblocking the qi.\nTransforming form and changing bones, becoming a true child,\nReversing age and halting the years, becoming a youth.\n\nTo gather the red maiden within yang,\nTo match her with the white-headed elder within yin—\nThereby eternally preserving boundless longevity,\nHow could the vulgar know of such merit?\n\nAmong the four great elements of the realm, the Dao comes first;\nHow can scant fortune comprehend mercury and lead?\nDo not believe that drawing out lead makes the great medicine—\nThey merely speak of burning mercury to supplement the cinnabar field.\n\nDeluded disciples often lose their way in the world,\nWhile the awakened repeatedly attain immortality.\nSince ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s method—\nHaving refined the nine tripods, he ascended to heaven.\n\nVainly seeking others, yet finding no one,\nHow many times has brooding harmed the spirit?\nThough you know all will gradually turn to dust,\nStill you zealously cling to treasures.\n\nOne method encompasses a thousand myriad affairs;\nA few pellets can sustain a hundred springs.\nThe poem early wished for shared awakening—\nDo not trust that there will be another cause in the next life.\n\nThe *Dan Jia Ji* is complete.",
