  "full_translation": "**Inscription for the Eastern Taiyi Palace of the Song Dynasty**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *The Eastern Taiyi of the Song: Brick Inscription*\n*Composed by Hu Meng of the Song Dynasty*\n*One chapter.*\n*Source of the base text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen Section*, *Records and Biographies Category*\n\n**Inscription for the Eastern Taiyi Palace of the Song Dynasty**\nComposed by Hu Meng, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Closing Court Affairs, Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, and Vice Director of the Chancellery\n\nTo establish the Imperial Ultimate, uphold Heaven’s mandate, examine ancient statutes, and exalt luminous sacrifices—these are the consummate tasks of the sage, and only our sovereign has achieved them. To revolve the mysterious transformation, embrace vast blessings, shower the people with fortune, and assist the utmost virtue—these are the radiant manifestations of the primordial spirit, and only the August Song has received them.\n\nOh, how resplendent is this great mandate! Born to embody the virtue of Fire, its numerical destiny fulfilled in the celestial reckoning, it is truly called an era of prosperity. Tending to the complete workings of creation, it is rightly deemed the work of the true lord. Thus, our emperor, who by destiny governs Heaven—the Illustrious, Cultured, Heroic, and Martial; the Greatly Sagacious, Luminous, and Vastly Filial—grasps the tally of Qian and rules from the abode of Kun, severing the turtle’s legs to establish the Four Pillars and restoring the earth’s foundations. Receiving the Dragon Diagram, he delineated the Eight Trigrams, illuminating the patterns of humanity.\n\nBy issuing warnings and decrees, he pacified the realm; with folded hands, he received the homage of all under Heaven. Thereupon, the Man, Yi, Rong, and Di tribes hastened to the gates of the imperial palace, while the mute and the foreign, the distant and the near, gathered beneath the suspended bells and chimes to offer their harmonious tribute. His vast enterprise and great deeds stand peerless across ten thousand ages, while his sagely transformation and pure virtue nearly perfected the Dao in a single change. Why must one wander to Mount Gushe to fathom the subtle and formless, or await the year of *Sheti* to mark the dawn of creation?\n\nMoreover, in reverently serving Heaven and Earth and harmonizing humans and spirits, the grand rites of the suburban altars were continually performed, and the sacred shrines of the suburban districts were diligently restored. Thereby, Qian and Kun achieved mutual prosperity, wind and rain never lost their way, and the imperial Dao flourished, giving rise to songs of praise.\n\nAmidst the myriad affairs of state, the sovereign found leisure to cultivate refined rituals. In the Hall of Audience, he inquired of the divine, often fixing his thoughts upon secret records; from the Terrace of Spirits, he observed the heavens, pondering the hidden within the constant patterns. He believed that when Emperor Shun received the great forest, he sacrificed to the Six Ancestral Spirits, and when the Han emperors flourished, they built their grand structures and sacrificed to the Five Seasons. The Way of revering the spirits has ever been thus since antiquity: to bring spring to all things, one must pray for blessings on behalf of the people.\n\nThus, in the eighth year of the *Taiping Xingguo* era, the year of *Xieqia*, in the third month of spring, an edict was issued to establish the Taiyi Palace in the *Xun* direction of the imperial capital, thereby housing the divine spirits and manifesting the sovereign’s sagely virtue.\n\nYour servant respectfully consults the *Records of the Grand Historian*, which states: \"The most honored of the celestial spirits is called Taiyi, and the assistants of Taiyi are the Five Emperors.\" In ancient times, the Son of Heaven regularly sacrificed to Taiyi in the southeastern suburbs during spring and autumn, offering a grand bull as the sacrificial animal. Formerly, Emperor Wu of Han performed this rite, and later, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang also worshipped there. Its ritual ranked just below the sacrifices to the Two Suburbs, and its altar was positioned next to the platform of the Two Modes.\n\nFrom this, the reverence and awe due to its majestic spirit may be discerned. Furthermore, I have heard from the school of Yin-Yang that the spirits of Taiyi are not of one kind. They bear titles such as Lord Chess and Minister Chess, Great Wanderer and Lesser Wanderer, some wielding authority over floods and droughts, others presiding over the calamities of war and famine. Only the Taiyi of the Five Fortunes ascends through the Five Palaces and gazes upon the Nine Lands. Where it arrives, the people all enjoy wealth and longevity; where it descends, the year is surely bountiful and free from misfortune. As the *Book of Songs* says, \"A hundred evils do not arise,\" and the *Book of Documents* states, \"The Five Fortunes surely attain.\" It is the Jupiter of the Seven Luminaries, the spring command of the Four Seasons.\n\nThus, the wise rulers of successive dynasties and the old statutes of former courts honored and sacrificed to it, and there was indeed good reason for this. Previously, the court astronomers submitted memorials, and the fangshi offered their counsel, saying that the Five Fortunes, in their celestial circuits, would soon visit the astrological regions of the Four Palaces. They proposed that, to transform the corrupt customs of Liaodong and Jieshi and to soothe the old domains of Wu and Yue, a sacred temple should be prepared in advance in that region. Little did they know that the sage harmonizes his virtue with the Two Modes, and the Son of Heaven takes the Four Seas as his home. Wherever the ten thousand chariots establish their capital, the hundred spirits gather there. For instance, the constellations Fang and Xin form the Bright Hall of the August Lord of Heaven, while the renowned regions of Liang and Song are the blessed lands of the Central Plains. To open an immortal abode there would surely be timely and efficacious.\n\nOur sagely emperor, who does not contravene the will of Heaven, serves the spirits as if they were present. He also sought to revive the old customs of the Sweet Springs Palace of the Han and follow the former precedents of the Huizhong and Weishang of the Zhou. Thus, he commanded the grand architects to calculate the labor, selected close ministers to oversee the work, divined this auspicious site, and founded this new palace. By the time it was inspected upon completion, it had not deviated from the original plan.\n\nBehold its magnificence: towering embankments rise like mountains, a hundred *zhi* of ramparts stretch in succession; lofty halls stand imposingly, a thousand pillars open wide. Its vast courtyards swallow the gates of the palace, and its soaring eaves reach the radiant heavens. The golden halls at the eight corners gleam with the brilliance of dawn, their cinnabar and azure resplendent; the jade altars, triple-layered, are adorned with evening dew like strings of pearls and jade. It is the alchemical palace beyond the heavens, the Penglai Isle within the sea.\n\nBehold its sacred representations: the jade-like figures are warm and lustrous, the jeweled thrones radiant. The autumn moon resembles a jade tablet, gleaming among the varied pendants; the morning glow is like fire, adorning the long robes. Banners are woven from colored mists, and canopies are raised from crimson clouds. The assembled immortals stand in attendance, as if at the time of reviewing the celestial registers; the gathered sages return, as if to the place of the primordial court. When rainbow banners and crimson staffs escort the wind-borne chariots in their arrival, when the zithers of Xiang and the reed pipes of Wei guide the cloud-borne carriages in their descent, then the fragrance of heaven will waft far across the divine land, and the ethereal music of immortals will be heard throughout the imperial domain.\n\nHow magnificent! Such are its numinous responses. Why must one await the bamboo palace’s distant worship to draw near its divine radiance, or the Feng and Shan sacrifices on Mount Song to exalt the sagely destiny?\n\nIn the autumn of the eighth month of the *Jiashen* year, the emperor, moved by his imperial heart, prepared the ritual regalia, mounted the phoenix carriage, raised the simurgh banners, and personally visited this palace, fulfilling every detail of the rites.\n\nOn this day, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders thundered like lightning, their ranks resounding. Tiger-bannered warriors stood guard without, while the court’s capped and gowned officials attended the rites within. The ten spirits were duly honored, and myriad blessings thus descended—such was the sincerity of the solemn sacrifice, moving the numinous to respond in hidden accord.\n\nThereupon, the emperor decreed the selection of feathered transcendents from the Ten Isles and eminent ministers from the inner palace to jointly oversee the rites and serve as guardians. Each year, on the three *yuan* festivals and the four seasonal propitious days, they would prepare the pure offerings upon the immortal’s altar, praying for boundless fortune upon the imperial house. Thus would the blessings of ten thousand years and a thousand ages be assured for the dynasty, and the timely rains and winds—five and ten—would never fail the seasons. For this was the mandate of heaven, a time of felicitous convergence, meant to preserve the jade chart for a hundred million years and flourish the imperial lineage through a thousand branches. How else could such divine favor descend from the vault of heaven, or such sacred blessings be bestowed by the gods?\n\nLet these words be carved in azure ink to record this wondrous merit.\n\n**Inscription:**\nThe August Emperor upholds the mandate,\nRevering the mysterious workings of the Dao.\nIn the brightness of emulating heaven,\nHe follows heaven’s Way,\nGuiding the present by ancient models,\nOutshining the glory of the past.\nOn this day, the great enterprise is secured,\nAnd the imperial throne forever stabilized.\n\nHeaven’s hidden depths,\nAll things revere its majesty.\nCeaseless in its vigorous motion,\nLofty and silent in its brilliance,\nIt gives life to all creatures,\nGoverning the destiny of humankind.\nThus must there be one who oversees its workings—\nWho is this overseer?\nThe Great One, dwelling in the Great.\nAbove, he treads the highest heavens,\nBelow, he surveys the mortal realm.\nHe stores up blessings,\nWherever people dwell.\nAs the golden palace’s prime minister,\nHe is the Jade Emperor’s chief steward.\nHis spirit is unfathomable,\nHis Dao subtle and profound.\nSerene, he wields the mysterious transformation,\nAbiding in the Purple Tenuity.\nVast blessings descend like dew,\nAuspicious fortune spreads like mist.\nHe harmonizes the jade candle of time,\nAligning with the celestial sphere’s turning.\nHis position crowns the nine palaces,\nHis influence encircles the eight directions.\nHis grace is deep, his blessings abundant,\nHis benevolence profound, his virtue aiding the Dao.\n\nThose rustic customs of distant lands\nAre not where the gods reside.\nThis central realm’s rightful seat\nDraws the gods in abundance.\nThe newly built palace soars like clouds,\nIts main hall stands open in mist.\nThe broad courtyard mirrors the bamboo grove,\nThe lofty terrace pierces the sky.\nAwaiting the descent of rainbow robes,\nHoping the cloud-borne will deign to come.\nFor ten thousand generations, prayers resound,\nBlessings extend to the nine realms and all beneath heaven.\n\n*Inscription for the Stele of the Eastern Great One’s Palace of Song*",
