  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra* (abbreviated as *Scarlet Script Jade Instructions*).\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient *Numinous Treasure Sutras*. Two scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Division, *Original Texts* category.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra, Scroll One**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Five Elder Thearchs, and the Great Deities of the Ten Directions convened in the Upper Palace of Vermilion Yang within the Southern Cavern. They were seated upon seven-jeweled thrones of luminous pearls in seven hues. Then, the Five Thearchic Great Sages and the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, along with fifty-two thousand five hundred in assembly, approached the dais. Heavenly perfumes and blossoms rained down, divine dragons and celestial musicians—innumerable hosts—filled the air. Purple clouds spread in all directions, the Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, the Celestial Origin rejoiced in harmony, and the assembled perfected ones arrived in procession.\n\nAt that time, the diligent scholar Wang Longci, who had been granted attendance at the seat, entreated to receive the precepts and commandments. The Dao addressed Longci:\n\n\"For seven million kalpas, I have reverently cultivated the Numinous Treasure, established vows to bestow and disseminate, upheld the precepts, observed fasts, endured hardship without retreat, revolved through birth and death, practiced forbearance and diligence, severed heterodox thoughts, and embraced emptiness and non-conception. Through the accumulation of these practices, I attained the profound quiescence that elevated me to the honored rank of the Sagely Dao.\n\nEver moved by compassion, I desire to broadly deliver all beings—whether male or female, those of noble aspiration and utmost sincerity—so that all may behold the wondrous Dharma of the Numinous Treasure. You, possessing a virtuous heart, have come to seek refuge in the Dharma Gate. This is due to your past lives across ten thousand kalpas, wherein you already revered the Utmost Perfected. Your merit is complete, your virtue fulfilled, enabling your rebirth in the Dao-world at this time of flourishing Dharma.\n\nNow, I shall expound for you the *Ten Sections of Sublime Sutras on Resolving Obstructions*, that you may deliver the multitudes of the Ten Directions—celestial and human alike. Apply yourself diligently and take heed, lest you be swayed by demonic words.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"The causes and conditions of birth and death, the revolving of blessings and vows—none arise apart from the body. The human body is difficult to obtain, the Dao-world difficult to encounter, the sutras difficult to attain, and the decisive teachings difficult to hear. Why, then, do I unfold the profound purport and expound the essential words?\n\nMoved by compassion for the beings of the Ten Directions who, upon receiving birth, cannot preserve and deliver their bodies, dwell long in suffering and affliction, willingly tread the path of transgression, and revolve through the Five Realms—none awakening—I broadly illuminate the Dharma teachings to guide the ignorant and benighted. Thus, all celestial and human beings may enter the Gate of the Supreme Orthodox and Perfected, universally delivering all who are born into this world. By virtue of their past karmic connections, the perfected ones shall all be enabled to transcend.\n\nI have received the ancient sutras of the Original Beginning’s true scriptures, expounding the Dharma to deliver the world for ten thousand kalpas. I shall return to the Primordial Profound Joy Heaven. After this world passes into the Five Turbidities, when the mandate of destiny is obstructed, whether male or female, they shall not behold the luminous teachings. They will abide perpetually in the evil destinies, their lifespans devoid of opportunity, beset by sorrow and torment, enduring unjust suffering. Born and dying of themselves, they revolve through the Five Realms, falling into the Three Wretched Paths and the Eight Difficulties. Calamities and retributions pursue one another endlessly, and in the separation of birth and death, there is no distinction of noble or base—truly a cause for grieving the heart.\n\nNow, I expound these essential teachings to deliver those who can be delivered. You must rectify your mind and attentively receive my words.\"\n\nThen, having received the talismanic instructions, Long Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in reverent acceptance of the teachings.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"You who receive the Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure must rise and face north, your entire body prostrated upon the earth, paying homage to the ten directions. Then, turn eastward and listen in prostration to the Ten Precepts:\n\nFirst: Let your heart be free of malice and envy, without the hidden thieves of yin. Guard your speech and be mindful of transgressions, keeping your thoughts fixed upon the Dharma.\n\nSecond: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing; show compassion and succor all living beings. Let your kindness and love extend broadly to save all, bestowing moisture upon all things.\n\nThird: Maintain chastity and yield to righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, diminishing yourself to aid others.\n\nFourth: Be free of sensuality and desire; let your heart not wander. Preserve purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.\n\nFifth: Let your mouth be free of evil speech; your words neither ornate nor deceitful. Be loyal and upright within and without, avoiding transgressions of the mouth.\n\nSixth: Abstain from wine and regulate your conduct, harmonizing your qi and nature. Let your spirit not be harmed, and refrain from all evils.\n\nSeventh: Do not envy those who surpass you or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, delivering others before yourself.\n\nEighth: Do not criticize the scriptures or slander the sacred texts. Apply your heart to upholding the Dharma, ever as though standing before the gods.\n\nNinth: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor pass judgment on the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor humans bear resentment, nor your spirit and qi be harmed.\n\nTenth: In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and a unified heart. Let harmony prevail between humans and gods, and let this be your constant practice.\n\nBy cultivating and upholding these pure precepts, you shall ever align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from this world of suffering. With reverence for the teachings, never grow lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil.\n\nThrough unwavering practice, you may extricate yourself from the Five Realms and avoid the Three Wretched Paths. You shall be protected by all heavens, revered by the myriad spirits, and by maintaining a perpetual fast and upholding the precepts, you shall naturally attain deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Dao continued: \"The Numinous Treasure reveals the Dharma to deliver beings, and there are twelve ways by which one may attain deliverance from the world. You should follow them, and by so doing, you shall naturally attain uprightness and ultimately enter the realm of non-action.\n\nFirst: Upon witnessing the true scriptures emerge to deliver all beings, arouse the intention for the Dao, and vow that in future lives you may ascend to the rank of Great Sage.\n\nSecond: Constantly practice a compassionate heart, wishing that all beings may behold the Dharma, be broadly and universally delivered, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nThird: Delight in the scriptures and teachings, deeply and extensively studying them. Let your will be firm and your understanding clear, enlightening the ignorant and benighted.\n\nFourth: Reverently receive the instructions of your teacher, broadly exhorting and transforming others, guiding them into the Dharma gate, and distancing them from blind paths.\n\nFifth: Have faith in and turn toward the profound and wondrous, reverently upholding the scriptures and their instructions. Recite them morning and evening without weariness or slackening.\n\nSixth: Do not pursue glory and splendor, severing worldly entanglements. Focus your heart and stabilize your will, directing all your endeavors toward the Dharma.\n\nSeventh: Diligently recite the great scriptures, wishing for all beings, and broadly build bridges for them, creating karmic conditions for future lives.\n\nEighth: Constantly cultivate a good heart, neither perverse nor false, without envy, harm, evil, or malice.\n\nNinth: Wherever you are born, may you always encounter a sagely age, and may the teachings of the Numinous Treasure Dharma never be interrupted.\n\nTenth: Purify your body and uphold the precepts; perform fasts and establish merit. Broadly save all living beings, that all may attain deliverance.\n\nEleventh: Extensively study and broadly disseminate the scriptures and Dharma, preparing for the company of gods and humans, universally guiding and delivering all.\n\nTwelfth: Constantly encounter enlightened teachers life after life, receiving their teachings and propagating them, delivering countless beings.\n\nThese are the Twelve Wondrous Instructions. By cultivating these good thoughts, you shall life after life behold the sacred texts, form affinities with the Dao, and be recognized as friends by all heavens. You shall stride alone through the Three Realms, unobstructed, forever departing from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. Divine luminaries shall respect and protect you; earthly deities shall surround and guard you. Your gates and households shall be pure and solemn, and the myriad calamities shall not encroach. All your aspirations and vows, through the recitation of this scripture, shall be fulfilled.\n\nThis good man or good woman, with a sincere heart and reverent devotion, shall belong to the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, penetrating the natural and spontaneously attaining the ability to traverse water and fire, transform their form and shadow, and ascend to the Upper Clarity. Before their merit is complete and they should pass through extinction, they shall be welcomed by the Five Emperors and ascend directly to the heavenly palaces, bypassing Mount Tai. They shall be transformed and born into noble lineages, encountering the scriptures and the Dao, and thus attain deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Dao addressed Long Ci: \"Diligently practice and attentively receive these teachings; do not grow remiss.\"\n\nLong Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in acceptance of the precepts.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"The true scriptures and incantations expound the supreme Dharma for deliverance. The ancient texts are profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail, and later scholars find them hard to apply. Therefore, I have annotated them in both elevated and plain styles to resolve obscurities. The jade instructions and true essentials elucidate the ancient texts, their subtle words and wondrous mysteries revered by all heavens. Upon reciting these jade chapters, the ten directions echo them from afar. In the heavens above, rituals are established; gods and demons are subdued, and ghosts and malevolent spirits are extinguished.\n\nFifty jade youths and fifty jade maidens attend the scriptures. From former lives through ten thousand kalpas, their names have been inscribed in the Supreme Mystery, yet they have not beheld these jade texts. Through the convergence of karmic conditions and encounters, they may attain immortality as divine transcendents. Their blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, and their grace flows to distant descendants, all delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. This scripture is most noble and wondrous beyond compare.\"\n\n**The Numinous Treasure’s Method for the Water Emperor to Erase Sin Tablets**\n\nNuminous Treasure [Name] Emperor, Master [Name], aged [Number] years, born in the [Number] month, vowing to become a spirit immortal, to attain eternal life without death, and to preserve the Three Origins in unity.\n\nThe Nine Mansion Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the gods of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji rivers, and the great spirits of the Mingling, beseech the erasure of sin names, that they may be reported to the Nine Heavens. They request to proceed to the Water Palace, conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.\n\nIn the year of [Celestial Stem and Branch], the [Number] month, the [Number] day of the new moon, at the [Number] hour, the document is proclaimed in [Name] kingdom.\n\nInscribe this in red upon a silver-wood tablet, wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, and have a golden dragon carry the tablet to cast it into the depths of the Three Rivers.

The sun, moon, and five stars; the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper; the Five Marchmounts at the center; the sacred mountains of the four quarters; the rivers and seas below; the Twelve Fountainheads; the Water Lords of the Nine Palaces; and the great spirits of the Mingling—today we make this supreme declaration. May all ten thousand vows be laid bare: we request to cast this jade tablet, beseeching the erasure of sin names.

This exalted talismanic decree universally proclaims to the Ten Heavens, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Five Marchmounts and sacred mountains, all above the earth and below the heavens, the great spirits of the Mingling, the Overseers of Life and Keepers of Records. Open the Three Southern Gates, receive the jade tablet, inscribe names upon the cinnabar register, erase the records of sins. Promote them to serve as imperial ministers.

On this auspicious day, we proclaim our decree; may the myriad spirits all heed. We entreat with golden clasps to manifest our utmost sincerity.

Erase the records of past sins, proclaim names to heaven, performing each act three times. The Three Officials of the Heavens and the Nine Palaces of the Earth will entrust one another, distinguishing all above in heaven. The myriad spirits will reverently protect, the Five Emperors will attend and guard, the administrators of the Three Realms will receive and welcome. Gates and doors will be ordered and solemn; the earthly deities below and the heavenly spirits above, the sun and moon, will come to pay homage. The thousand demons and myriad spirits dare not rashly interfere. If your aspirations are firm and pure, all vows will be fulfilled. Your seven generations of fathers and mothers will immediately be liberated from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, ascending to the heavenly palaces. Life and death will be blessed, and retribution will correspond accordingly. The Three Officials and Nine Palaces record the merits and transgressions of people—this principle is most clear. Through generations of karmic conditions, not a hair’s breadth will be lacking. You must earnestly uphold and practice this, never growing lax, lest demons corrupt your true nature.\n\n*Eastern Nine Qi Azure Heaven True Script Red-Script Jade Formula*\n\nThe Nine Qi of the East, the August Azure Heaven, where verdant mists rise in layered ranks.

spontaneous script,\nAlso called the *Golden Perfected’s Precious Luminous Cavern-Subtle Chapter*, the *Western Mountain Divine Incantation*, or the *Eight Might Dragon-Summoning Text*.\n\n---\n\n**Northern Heavens’ Five Qi: Mysterious Heaven’s True Writ of Vermilion Script and Jade Formula**\n\nThe Northern Mysterious Heaven, five qi meandering,\nWithin abides the Black Thearch, the Dual August Great Tenuity,\nOverseeing talismanic writs, refining immortals in the Eight Might,\nClad in azure skirts and feathered cloaks, dragon-patterned phoenix robes,\nDescended by the Supreme Thearch, arrayed along jade steps.\nIts forty characters govern the registers of all perfected and divine immortals.\nStudents of the Dao should, on their natal day, the first *jiazi*, or the day of Winter’s Beginning,\nInscribe the forty characters in black upon a white tablet, record their name and date beneath, and cast it upon a sacred mountain’s peak.\nAfter five years, the immortal officials will arrive, dispatching five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens—\nYour name will be recorded in the immortal registers.\n\nThe Northern Asterism assists the kidneys, Dipper and Oxguard the gates,\nMaiden, Void, Rooftop, and Encampment open the four directions,\nWall unites the seven stars, seizing the inauspicious and rectifying wrongs,\nAverting disasters and sweeping away defilements, illuminating the Dao with resplendent brilliance.\nIts thirty-two characters govern the rectification of the northern stellar officials and celestial qi.\nFor all deviations of the northern asterisms that give rise to various disasters and anomalies,\nInscribe the thirty-two characters in vermilion upon blue paper, expose it in the central courtyard for five days and five nights, facing north each evening.\nFollow the separate incantation method, then burn the text with fire and scatter the ashes into the azure smoke.\nAlso carve the thirty-two characters upon black stone and bury it in the north—\nCelestial disasters will vanish of their own accord, and the asterisms will return to their proper positions.\n\nThe Northern Mountain Divine Incantation stirs the yang to raise thunder,\nFlowing bells gleam and fall, the simian heavens shake with might,\nThe Northern Feng’s legions, the myriad demons crushed and destroyed.\nIts twenty-four characters govern the subjugation of celestial demons, the Northern Thearch, and the myriad ghosts.\nTo perform this method, inscribe the twenty-four characters in blue upon a black wooden tablet, direct the text toward the northeast, and follow the separate incantation.\nFivefold performing this method, ghostly essences will vanish of their own accord, the myriad demons will be bound in form—proceed with focused intent.\n\nThe nine rivers drain and dry, the crow mothers flock in flight,\nDragons open the paths, water veins unsealed,\nVermilion script and jade characters borne by dragon couriers on the wind.\n\nIts twenty-four characters govern the subjugation of the Northern Sea’s Water Thearch, the control of the myriad spirits within waters, and the summoning of dragons to bear one’s body. Should one wish to cross great floods or disasters, or encounter aquatic perils endangering all beings, inscribe the twenty-four characters in yellow upon blue paper, follow the separate incantation, and cast the written form of all beings into the waters—thus may one traverse the flood, dragons will open the waterways, and the Water Officials shall emerge in welcome.\n\nTogether, the one hundred twenty characters comprise the *Writ of the Northern Cavern’s Dark Yin, the Solitary North, the Stifled, the Severed, and the Five Numinous Ones of the Mysterious Venerable Lord*—also called the *Spontaneous Writ of the Primordial Spirit’s Birth of True Treasure Radiance*, the *Northern Mountain Divine Incantation*, or the *Eightfold Might’s Celestial Control Writ*. For all who initiate vows to seek the Dao, present petitions, or perform rites, none may proceed without first turning east, knocking the teeth thrice, and holding incense to recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Most High Venerable Lord, summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six each—to emerge from the passes. I now invoke this land’s earth spirits and the true officials of the four directions. As I burn incense and open the passes, may the qi of the ten directions’ true and numinous ones enter my body, that my supplications ascend and reach the presence of the Most High, Perfectly True, Greatly Sage, Honored Divine Jade Thearch.\"*\n\nFor all who study the Dao and make petitions, or cultivate the supreme methods, failure to first open the passes invites interference by demonic forces, preventing ascent—all efforts will lack resonance, the spirits will not witness them, and labor will be in vain.\n\n**The Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs and Jade Formulas**\nThe Dao states: Those who study the supreme methods, contemplate the spirits, and meditate upon the Dao—dwelling in mountains with tranquil intent, observing fasts, reciting scriptures, liberating the seven ancestors, and seeking transcendence for themselves—must practice the *Supreme Method of the Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs*. According to the ancient texts, one must first knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious and Lofty Numinous Ones, Primordial Honored Spirits, Great Sages who wander, the myriad spirits attend the hall. The Three Radiant Ones spread their brilliance, auspicious clouds array the four quarters. I report to the celestial registers, ascending through the nine heavens. Today I initiate my vow, presenting my petition to the numinous mountain. Vermilion script and red characters, the spontaneous true writ, I report to the Five Thearchs, inscribing my name in the Jade Chapters. The myriad spirits bear witness, the sun and moon illuminate my words. May my vows for deliverance and rebirth, for spirithood and transcendence, be seen by the heavens, earth, and stellar lodges. May the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the great spirits of the Five Peaks, universally proclaim without end: sever my roots of sin. The Primordial opens all, none shall reject my words. May the seven ancestors’ imprisoned souls receive blessings spontaneously, forever departing the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, escaping the Eight Perils. May I join the Three Radiant Ones, shining with the Purple Dawn, revolving without end, attaining the flight of transcendence.\"*\n\nUpon completion, read the petition aloud, cast it into an abyssal cliff, then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain. Knock the teeth thrice more and recite toward your life’s origin:\n\n*\"The Primordial oversees and witnesses, my immortal name is inscribed. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus shall erase all sins. Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs, pledge alliance with the Great Void. As I have petitioned, may I abide for ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nConclude by inhaling nine qi and ceasing.\n\n**The Five Venerables’ Jade Formula for Dispelling Stellar Calamities and Illuminating Heaven’s Allotted Degrees**\nThe Dao states: The stellar lodges of the various heavens each hold allotted degrees. When their paths deviate or trespass, encroaching upon one another, or when omens appear in the four directions’ domains, these arise from the misfortune of celestial qi’s cyclical obstructions, forcing them beyond their allotted lands. Thus, the celestial light shifts to illuminate and mystically report the inauspicious.\n\nTherefore, the Primordial bequeathed this writ to harmonize heaven and pacify earth, dispel disasters and relieve afflictions, secure the state and tranquilize the people. Those of utmost sincerity must cultivate this method with devotion. On the day the calamity appears, inscribe the true writ as in the ancient method and expose it in the central courtyard. Face the afflicted direction, knock the teeth twelve times, loosen the hair, and raise a prayer:\n\n*\"Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ lofty brilliance, revolving radiance illuminates the four directions’ clarity. Where the cyclical degrees clash, meteors surge and stream. The Five Borders transgress, the Three Systems lose peace. The Five Celestial Dipper’s total stars, the Seven Lodges’ numinous spirits, the True Lords and Great Leaders—whose tabooed name is Jade Essence—with the Empress and Royal Consort, styled ‘Nurturing Infant,’ together govern the Mysterious Pass, revolving the myriad heavens. Now, with this guest calamity, I mystically report the inauspicious. I present the true writ, the red script, to ascend in offering. With loosened hair, I confess my transgressions, revealing my vermilion sincerity. May the Mysterious One deign to witness, restoring the celestial canon. May qi not trespass, disasters not arise wantonly. I burn the numinous writ, scattering smoke in the Jade Court. The Upper Radiance oversees the degrees, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits. May the Three Passes’ qi be purified, the Nine Darks’ calamities be extinguished. Yin and yang harmonized, the land shall know great peace. I present this with golden dragons and wind-borne couriers.\"*\n\nConclude by exposing the true writ in the central courtyard and anchoring it with a golden dragon. If the calamity lies in the east, burn the true writ after nine days and nights, scattering the ashes in the blue smoke.\n\nFor all methods to dispel celestial calamities and pacify state and people, light lamps corresponding to the afflicted direction to illuminate the celestial lights. If the east is afflicted, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred—and use one liang and one piece of golden dragon. For eastern calamities, use ninety feet of blue silk over nine days and nights. For southern calamities, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—and use thirty feet of crimson silk over three days and nights. For central calamities, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—and use one hundred twenty feet of yellow silk over twelve days and nights. For western calamities, light seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred—and use seventy feet of white silk over seven days and nights. For northern calamities, light five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred—and use fifty feet of black silk over five days and nights.\n\nThis is the *Shangyuan* ritual method of the Primordial Numinous Treasure. The *True Writs and Jade Formulas of the Five Venerables of the Primordial Beginning for Dispelling the Great Kalpa’s Deluge, Summoning the Flood Dragons, and the Water Officials to Deliver from Disaster*.\n\nThe Dao declares: When the great kalpa of heaven and earth converges, the deluge surges forth in all directions, sweeping away filth and eradicating evil, leaving nothing behind. At this time, heaven and earth merge in darkness, and the people drift without distinction of good or ill. Only those scholars of resolute aspiration, who obtain the true writs of the Numinous Treasure and the talismans of the great and minor kalpas, may ride upon flying feathers to ascend in lofty observation, or mount the numinous peaks to soar freely. At this moment, divine beings shall command the flood dragons to clear the paths, opening waterways to ferry the body, while the River Earl awaits in attendance, sparing one from the need for bridges or ferries. Thus is the marvel of the numinous writs revealed—how could it be confined to the convergence of the great kalpa?\n\nWhen encountering such a time, one must follow the writ’s instructions: face north, click the teeth five times, and hold the breath for twenty-five cycles. Visualize a fire arising from within one’s heart and mind, emerging from the crown of the head to burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees of the four directions, as well as one’s own body entirely, reducing form and bones to ashes, all of which ascend in a wisp of blue smoke, leaving nothing behind. Envision the great waters surging boundlessly across the world, while one’s body transforms into a flood dragon, drifting with the current.\n\nThen, click the teeth twenty-five times again and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\n*\"The Primordial Beginning revolves the numinous,\nIlluminating the Nine Origins.\nHeaven turns, earth shifts,\nThe two qi flow and transmit.\nThe Five Phases press onward,\nThe mechanism of destiny revolves.\nYin and yang clash in opposition,\nBinding calamity into collision.\nThe great kalpa nears its end,\nSweeping filth and dispelling miasma.\nThe Nine Rivers receive their reckoning,\nThe deluge rages through the streams.\nThe Water Mother lingers,\nBirds and horses gather in herds.\nSun and moon meet in darkness,\nThe Three Luminaries halt their course.\nThe exalted select their ministers,\nExamining the jade writs in judgment.\nAbandoning evil, preserving good,\nThe pure and turbid are forever divided.\nI partake in the imperial register,\nMy name inscribed in the Nine Heavens.\nAt the convergence of the four great disasters,\nThe Red Writs absolve all.\nThis day, the decree is proclaimed,\nAll spirits hear it in unison.\nSun, moon, and the Five Stars\nIlluminate my soul.\nThe numinous mountains of the Five Peaks\nFloat and ferry my body.\nThe Water Palaces of the Nine Rivers,\nThe vast and cold great spirits,\nOpen and clear the waterways,\nUnblocking the river fords.\nThe flood dragons respond to the talisman,\nSeizing mountains to escort the numinous.\nBearing me, ferrying me,\nThey gallop in startled haste in all directions.\nThe cinnabar script in red characters,\nThe true writs of the Primordial Beginning,\nPresented by the golden dragon couriers,\nWithout delay, moment by moment,\nMust be immediately reported,\nFacing the imperial honor above.\"*\n\nUpon completion, swallow the qi twenty-five times. In an instant, the spirits who open the waters shall appear to ferry your body. If in the mountains, the mountains will float. If in the water, the waters will part.\n\nThis may be called deliverance in the face of peril.\nIn the blink of an instant, heaven and earth are wholly leveled.\n\nThe *Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders* summon the demons and devils of the Northern Feng with the *Red Writs and Jade Formulas*.\n\nThe Dao declares: Those who receive the supreme methods of the *Numinous Treasure* and cause divine luminaries to descend must first distinguish the forms of demons and devils to block and repel their trials. Once demonic essences are subdued, focused contemplation naturally induces resonance, and divine luminaries are readily summoned. To practice this method, proceed according to the writs of the *Supreme Perfected*:\nFace the northeast, click the teeth thirty-six times, and hold the breath for nine cycles. Then, looking upward, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Three Origins unfold illumination,\nRevolving and turning heaven’s constancy.\nThe reckoning advances to its limit,\nA hundred and six weave the cosmic net.\nAt the great kalpa’s convergence,\nMyriad demons contend in their courses.\nThe Northern Feng knows no restraint,\nReleasing the ancestral ghosts.\nHordes of demons rampage wantonly,\nObstructing the light of heaven.\nThe August Emperor commands,\nProclaiming to the ten directions:\nUnfolding the celestial demons’ clarity,\nThe Dharma’s teachings spread and flourish.\nThe true Dao governs the people,\nSweeping away inauspiciousness.\nWhat petty demons dare\nGather in throngs?\nThe Red Writs and Jade Texts\nRestrain and seize the demonic realms.\nThe Three Officials of the Northern Feng,\nSwiftly transmit the decree.\nA thousand demons bind their radiance,\nTen thousand ghosts surrender their forms.\nFlowing bells intermingle in splendor,\nStirring the qi of the Great Yang.\nGolden tigers patrol the four quarters,\nHeavenly soldiers mend the void.\nGreat and small, all assemble,\nNone may conceal or hide.\nWhat the Primordial Beginning proclaims,\nIs reported in the Upper Palace.\"*\n\nThe *Primordial Beginning’s Numinous Treasure: True Writs and Jade Formulas of the Five Thearchs*\n\nThe Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Azure Thearch*, faces east, clicks the teeth nine times, and visualizes azure qi entering through the mouth to infuse the liver, generating nine layers of azure efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the nape. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Primordial azure essence,\nGreat spirit of the nine qi,\nDivine radiance scattering like rosy clouds,\nFlowing and illuminating the eastern azure.\nLuminous splendor burgeons luxuriantly,\nIrrigating my bodily form.\nPalaces and bureaus are pacified and settled,\nThe precious soul naturally arises.\nPenetrating the eightfold clarity,\nAscending to the Jade Court.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the qi nine times. Those who ingest do so; those who wear it, wear it.\n\nThe Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Vermilion Thearch*, faces south, clicks the teeth three times, and visualizes vermilion qi entering through the mouth to infuse the heart, generating three layers of cinnabar efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the chest. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Cinnabar efflorescence flows and illuminates,\nPrecious mushrooms radiate light.\nDivine essence penetrates the obscure,\nDispersing numinous power to the eight directions.\nThe true talisman gathers qi,\nWhistling to summon the Vermilion Youth.\nThreefold essence unfolds in splendor,\nInfusing my Crimson Palace.\nThe vermilion spirit is pacified and settled,\nFive fragrances overflow and fill.\nLuminous within and without,\nInner and outer emit radiance.\nThe body generates water and fire,\nStriding alone in flight.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the qi three times, as in the method above.\n\nThe Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Yellow Thearch*, faces the center, clicks the teeth twelve times, and visualizes yellow qi entering through the mouth to infuse the spleen, generating twelve layers of yellow efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the entire body. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The *Comprehensive Primordial Writ* is numinous,\nRevolving the spirit to the four quarters.\nYellow efflorescence scatters above,\nThe Five Thearchs intermingle their fragrance.\nFlowing essence disperses languor,\nTwelve layers of radiance.\nMerging with my form,\nMyriad spirits come to welcome.\nPacifying and preparing the yellow spleen,\nNurturing qi in the central chamber.\nPreserving longevity through kalpas,\nEternally settled without end.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the qi twelve times, as in the method above.\n\nThe Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the White Thearch*, faces west, clicks the teeth seven times, and visualizes white qi entering through the mouth to infuse the lungs, generating seven layers of pristine efflorescence and precious radiance that suffuse the cinnabar field. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Golden spirit of the seven qi,\nPristine efflorescence flowing in mist.\nThe Golden Essence Youth,\nFirst dons the primordial kerchief.\nBearing the talisman to gather qi,\nMyriad spirits assemble at the gate.\nPrecious radiance resplendent,\nIlluminating my life-root.\nPacifying and settling the lung’s efflorescence,\nEnduring through ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the qi seven times, as in the method above.\n\nThe Daoist ingests the *True Talisman of the Black Thearch*, faces north, clicks the teeth five times, and visualizes black qi entering through the mouth to infuse the kidneys, generating five layers of mysterious precious efflorescence and radiance that suffuse the back. With the talisman placed before them, they recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Mystery of the northern heights,\nFive qi meander and linger.\nPrecious efflorescence in five layers,\nFlowing radiance gleaming and luminous.\nCloudy scenes luxuriant and elegant,\nSuffusing the Great Subtlety.\nLooking upward to infuse my body,\nThe kidney’s palace freshly opens.\nPacifying and settling the numinous abode,\nMyriad spirits wholly return.\nThe body generates feathered raiment,\nDescending in form, it flies of itself.\"*\n\nUpon completion, draw in the qi five times, as in the method above.\n\nTake bamboo from a numinous mountain facing the center, seven *chi* in length with seven nodes, to fashion a divine staff, ensuring it is perfectly straight from top to bottom; sweet bamboo is best. Inscribe the *Black Thearch’s Talisman* within the second node from the bottom; next, the *White Thearch’s Talisman* within the third node; then the *Yellow Thearch’s Talisman* within the fourth node; next, the *Vermilion Thearch’s Talisman* within the fifth node; and finally, the *Azure Thearch’s Talisman* within the sixth node. Leave the top node empty to connect with heaven, and the bottom node empty to stand upon the earth. Seal the top node with wax and impress it with the *Primordial Beginning’s Seal*. Seal the bottom node with wax and impress it with the *Five Thearchs’ Seal*. Wrap it in a crimson silk sheath, its length and size sufficient to contain the staff. In lying down, resting, sitting, or rising, always keep it by your side. When moving about, you may remove the staff from its sheath, concealing it as you come and go, and place it separately when resting. Point the staff toward heaven, and heavenly spirits will render homage. Point it toward the earth, and earthly deities will receive and welcome. Point it toward the northeast, and myriad ghosts will bind their forms. When riding the staff to travel or intending to employ it, click the teeth thirty-six times and visualize the *Straight Talisman Officers* of the Five Thearchs, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs, one each, together guard the staff on either side. Softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mountain of the Great Yang,\nPrimordial essence of the Primordial Beginning,\nOpening and unfolding heaven and earth,\nSweet bamboo connects with the numinous.\nStraight Talisman Officers and Guardians,\nCommanding and directing divine soldiers.\nFive colors flow and illuminate,\nVermilion fire and golden bells.\nAssisting the Supreme Perfected,\nExiting darkness and entering obscurity.\nSummoning heaven, heaven obeys;\nSeizing earth, earth welcomes.\nPointing at ghosts, ghosts perish;\nDemons and devils bind their forms.\nThe numinous talisman and divine staff\nCommand authority in all directions.\nWith me they are perfected,\nWith me they are born.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas,\nThey will replace my form.\nTheir luminosity dissolves into five,\nThe spirit ascends to the Upper Clarity.\nBearing the talisman to proclaim the decree,\nNone dare disobey.\"*\n\nWhen finished, draw the qi of the Five Directions, swallowing each five times, totaling twenty-five swallows to conclude. Practicing this Dao for nine years with utmost diligence and reverence, the divine spirits will manifest in form, and the staff will carry one through the air. Should one seek liberation through the corpse, the staff will replace one’s form, and in an instant, one will become a Perfected. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and the eight seasonal nodes, burn incense to the left and right, and pay homage to this staff—then the numinous spirits will descend in response, and the Dao will be accomplished.\n\n**Numinous Treasure Eight Might Divine Staff Jade Formula**\nInscribe in vermilion the *Three Heavens Supreme Venerable Summoning and Subduing Flood Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits Text* upon a silverwood board. Record the year, month, and the master’s surname and given name on another board. Bind the two boards together and enclose them in a pouch. Inscribe the following text in vermilion on another board and place it outside the pouch. Altogether, three boards are sealed to form the Divine Staff, as in the transmission’s form. All boards must be made of silverwood, one foot and four inches in length, two inches and four fen in width. Use crimson silk to make a pouch twelve feet in length, wrapping it around the outer board, and impress the seal of the Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders at the lower end. Encase it in a sterculia wood box, clad in crimson silk, and store it in a separate chamber with the invocation text for the staff. Burn incense to the left and right, and reverently attend to it. When received, wear it on the body. All divine spirits under heaven will attend at the gates day and night, accompanied by twelve Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors. When traveling, the Five Emperors will serve as guards, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you. No longer will you face the three evil destinies in life or death; you will bypass Mount Tai and ascend directly to the Nine Heavens. Clothing and sustenance will come naturally, and your rank will equal that of the Great Ultimate. Ultimately, you will attain immortality.\n\nWhen a Daoist adept wears this text and employs the divine incantations, pointing the staff text toward heaven, the heavenly spirits will offer rites. Pointing it toward earth, the earth spirits will bow in reverence, and the Three Realms will gird their sashes. Pointing it toward spirits, they will pay homage. Pointing it toward ghosts, they will perish and scatter. Pointing it toward water, the water spirits will clear the way. When great kalpas intersect and floods converge from all directions, use the staff to summon dragons, and they will bear you upon their backs. Through long cultivation and accumulated resonance, divine spirits will gather in response—wherever you invoke them, they will arrive instantly. A thousand transformations and ten thousand wonders will follow your will. In your comings and goings through the years, your rank will be that of the Great Ultimate. You will be preceded by flying dragons and guided by the Celestial Pivot, with phoenixes wailing and simurghs singing, twelve radiant blossoms, and the banners of the Three Sevens. After nine years of focused practice, the celestial regalia will naturally be complete.\n\n**Incantation of the Numinous Treasure Eight Might Divine Staff:**\n*\"Supreme Perfected of the Primordial Beginning,\nFive Numinous Ones of exalted honor,\nGreat Flower’s luminous radiance,\nPervading brightness through the Eight Gates.\nThe Five Elders proclaim the decree,\nNo hidden place beyond their reach.\nAbove, they govern the Nine Heavens;\nAt the center, they command Mount Feng;\nBelow, they oversee rivers and seas,\nThe twelve water sources.\nThe Eight Might Divine Incantation,\nNuminous Staff Jade Text—\nSummon dragons to bear the waters,\nGather qi and assemble clouds,\nBind demons and dispatch ghosts,\nSweep away demonic hordes.\nTen thousand spirits crumble,\nNone escape destruction.\nSun, moon, and Five Stars,\nNorthern Dipper’s Seven Origins,\nAll heavens, all earths,\nAll waters, all mountains,\nThe Jade Perfected’s retinue,\nVast and profound great spirits,\nImmortal Kings at their banquets,\nFive Emperors’ staffs and banners,\nCelestial Soldiers leading the way,\nGolden Tigers rushing behind,\nMighty beasts of the Heavenly Apes,\nArrayed at the Four Passes.\nWhat is called arrives instantly,\nWhat is summoned stands before you.\nVermilion script blazes forth,\nWind and fire unceasing.\nAll that is commanded is verified,\nTransmitted by Golden Dragons.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth nine times, raise the head and roar thrice toward heaven, draw the celestial qi three times, and point the staff text toward the designated place.

The numinous perfected will descend to the chamber, the Five Emperors’ officials and retinues will guard the gates, demonic forces will vanish, and all endeavors will succeed.\n\nInscribe the Vermilion Script of the Azure Emperor on azure silk and place it on the eastern wall of the chamber. Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the Vermilion Emperor on crimson silk and place it on the southern wall. Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the Yellow Emperor on yellow silk and place it at the Center. Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the White Emperor on white silk and place it on the western wall. Inscribe the Vermilion Script of the Black Emperor on black silk and place it on the northern wall. Arrange the five texts within the fasting hall, burn incense morning and evening, and pay homage in the respective directions. No profane or unfamiliar persons may enter the hall. Each direction is guarded by mighty spirits, jade lads and maidens; violations will be reported to the Nine Heavens, and dark retribution will swiftly follow. Practitioners must strictly observe the prohibitions.\n\nWithin the Nine *Qi* Azure Heaven resides the Primordial Azure Numinous Lad, named Kaiyang Qing, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Azure Emperor. The Azure Numinous Lad is nine inches tall, clad in azure feathered robes, and holds a green banner, standing to the left of the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their liver palace, bestowing the essence of azure *qi*.\n\nWithin the Three *Qi* Cinnabar Heaven resides the Primordial Vermilion Numinous Lad, named Danquan Zhu, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Vermilion Emperor. The Vermilion Numinous Lad is three inches tall, clad in red feathered robes, and holds a red staff, standing before the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be readily answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their heart, bestowing the essence of vermilion cinnabar *qi*.\n\nWithin the Central Yellow Heaven resides the Primordial Yellow Numinous Lad, named Hongying, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Numinous Lad is one inch and two *fen* tall, clad in yellow feathered robes, and holds a yellow halberd, standing at the center of the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their spleen palace, bestowing the essence of yellow *qi*.\n\nWithin the Seven *Qi* Simplicity Heaven resides the Primordial White Numinous Lad, named Mingshi Liu, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the White Emperor. The White Numinous Lad is seven inches tall, clad in white feathered robes, and holds a white banner, standing to the right of the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their lung palace, bestowing the essence of white *qi*.\n\nWithin the Five *Qi* Mysterious Heaven resides the Primordial Black Numinous Lad, named Yuzī, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Black Emperor. The Black Numinous Lad is five inches tall, clad in black feathered robes, and holds a black banner, standing behind the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their kidney palace, bestowing the essence of black *qi*.\n\nThese Five Thearch Numinous Lads, born together with the Primordial Five Elders, govern the Five Chapters of the True Text. Above, they command the *qi* of the Nine Heavens; below, they preside over the Five Marchmounts; and within, they master the five viscera, drawing the essence of the Five *Qi* to nourish the human body. Those who ingest the Five *Qi* yet remain ignorant of these spirits will ultimately fail to receive response, their efforts spent in vain.\n\nThus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*\n\nThe Primordial Thearch, the Numinous Treasure Venerable Divinity, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct customarily visit the Southern Thearch’s Cavernous Yang Palace thrice yearly to audit the celestial origins, reckon the kalpas’ conjunctions, and unveil the Vermilion Script of the Five Elders’ True Text, sealing it upon jade tablets to bestow upon the Five Thearchs.\n\nThe Five *Qi* of the Primordial Thearch regularly ascend at cock’s crow to convene at the Numinous Treasure’s Jade Capital and the Mysterious Metropolis’ Upper Palace. As the yang light first brightens, it scatters the radiance of the Primordial Thearch, surveying the myriad heavens. Its *qi* is lush and luxuriant, its brilliance warm and pervasive, its essence like moonlit pearls, its light like purple clouds. The Five *Qi* revolve like a chariot’s wheel, ascending to govern the gates of the Nine Heavens, securing the numinous mountains of the Five Thearchs in the center, and descending to infuse the roots of the Five *Qi* within the scholars. The assembly of sages and Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace all partake of its radiance at that hour, inhaling its essence, aligning with heaven to attain boundlessness.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord requested the transcription of this text to transmit it to the utmost perfected. According to the Mysterious Regulations of the Numinous Treasure, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. Thus, the Numinous Treasure’s illumination emerges to deliver beings through the Dharma.\n\nThe Ten Directions’ Great Sage Venerable Divinities and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct convened together at the Three Primes’ Cavern Chamber on the Crimson Glow’s Slope in the Southern Garden, sealing the jade tablets. The host of perfected attended in assembly, with fragrant flowers, ritual music, and fifty million in attendance. The True Text shone resplendently, its luminosity penetrating within and without. The Five *Qi* surveyed the radiance, illuminating all directions. Cloudscapes were clear and bright, like the moon amidst stars, their wondrous forms and manifold excellences beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, in the Northern Chamber, there was a diligent and worthy man named Wang Fudu. He had a daughter named Aqiuceng, aged sixteen, who was then in the bathhouse, washing herself with fragrant water. She saw a golden light curving and shining, suspecting something unusual. She exited the chamber, climbed the wall, and gazing southward, beheld the Perfected of the Dao. Their divine essence blazed brilliantly, their countenance and luminosity outshone the sun. The girl rejoiced in her heart, clasped her hands in salutation, and called out from afar: “My name is Qiuceng. Today, I am fortunate to encounter this assembly, to behold the Heavenly Venerable, and to return my being to the Heaven within the Heavens of the Ten Directions. I beseech the precepts, to uphold and follow the Dharma texts, to eradicate all evil roots, to swiftly attain rebirth, to transform into a male form, and after ten thousand kalpas, to aspire to become a flying immortal.”\n\nThe Five Thearchs’ Demon Kings, seeing the girl make such a great vow, feared she might transcend their realm. They transformed into five elderly thearchs and approached the girl, saying: “We have received the mandate of the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions to convey to you the regulations of the Numinous Treasure’s Dharma. Our Dao is now spreading, and its Dharma promotes benevolence and love, with filial piety as its foundation. We have heard that your father intended to marry you off, having already accepted another’s proposal, which cannot be revoked. You should first comply with this, fulfill your human duties, and complete your rites and teachings. Thereafter, you may offer yourself. Heaven observes your heart; if you defy your father, there will be no means for the immortals to deliver you.”\n\nThe girl replied to the demons: “In my past life, I was unfortunate, lacking karmic conditions, and my merits and virtues were insufficient, resulting in my rebirth as a woman. From dawn to dusk, I repent and reflect, vowing to maintain a single heart, my resolve firm and arising naturally. My life comes from my parents, but my destiny lies with the Ten Heavens. Though I sincerely defy my father’s teachings, it is not as you say.” The demons, seeing the girl’s steadfast heart and upright conduct, could not sway her, and thus retreated.\n\nQiuceng declared: “The Dao is lofty and remote, and I have no means to attain it. I shall gather firewood, climb the wall, and burn my body, hoping that my form may become flying ashes, carried by the wind to descend before the Dao.” Thereupon, the fire ignited. Qiuceng clasped her hands toward heaven and said: “Venerable Ones of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Heavens, today I return my form to the Heaven within the Heavens. May I attain timely liberation, to disperse like dust.” She then cast herself into the fire. Suddenly, she felt no attachment, her body as if treading empty space. In an instant, she saw her female form transform into a male, who proceeded directly before the Dao and there received the precepts.\n\nThe Primordial Thearch then commanded the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen to be the girl’s master, transmitting to her the True Text. He assigned three hundred Jade Maidens of Great Florescence and three hundred Jade Lads of Golden Dawn, all adorned with the thirty-two marks, their brilliance illuminating the girl’s body. The Dao addressed the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen: “This girl, in her past life, had already revered the Numinous Treasure. After ten thousand kalpas of rebirth, she has now been reborn among humans. Upon witnessing my revelation of the Dharma, she immediately attained transformation of form. She shall further deliver ninety-nine thousand beings before attaining the rank of Great Perfected Divinity.”\n\nAt that time, all beings—whether male or female—awakened to the intent of the True Dao, none failing to diligently uphold the fasts and precepts, cultivate and follow the Numinous Treasure. With utmost aspiration in their crowns, all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Dao addressed Aqiuceng: “The Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen was once also a woman, born in the world of Chanli within the Crimson Brightness Heaven. She performed great merits, praised by all heavens. Before her Dao could be accomplished, she encountered the kalpa of fire, when heaven and earth exchanged positions, and she was among those cast aside. The Southern Culmen was moved by her utmost sincerity, and the Vermilion Palace inscribed her purple name. Her form was transformed within the womb of the Primordial Lady. After one kalpa, she was reborn as a male, dwelling in the Seven-Colored Jeweled Grove of the Upper Bright Pearl Palace in the Southern Vermilion Cavernous Yang. She studied under the Red Thearch’s Brahma Treasure and the Perfected Elder of the Vermilion Yang of the Flourishing Sun. Having mastered the Vermilion Script, she ascended to the rank of the Southern Culmen.”\n\nIn your former life, you dwelled with the Southern Culmen in the world of Chanli, where beneath the cypress grove of Vermilion Yang, you together awakened the intent for the Dao. At that time, the Southern Culmen bore the surname Huang and the style Duming. He took your right hand, and together you inscribed red stone, recording your names in the Southern Palace. Your brushstrokes were also inscribed upon the southern veranda, and they remain there to this day—the stone inscriptions still endure. Do you recall this?\n\nQiu Zeng’s heart awakened, and lowering his gaze, he beheld the carved script on the southern wall where the Southern Culmen resided: *\"On the first day of the seventh month in the year Tai Jia, Huang Duming and A Qiu Zeng together vowed beneath the cypress grove of Vermilion Yang.\"* Twenty-three characters in all, each distinct and clear. Yet scarcely had he recalled this when suddenly three kalpas of heaven and earth had passed, and now he was reborn into the world of Lingbao.\n\nThe Dao spoke to Qiu Zeng: \"Now that you have taken the Southern Culmen as your master, is this not exalted? All this arises from the karmic conditions of your past lives. You must diligently cultivate the supreme practice, broadly deliver heaven and humanity, and when your merits are complete and your virtue perfected, you shall naturally ascend to the rank of Perfected, transcend the Three Clarities, swiftly traverse the Nine Radiant Mists, and attend the court of the Great Mystery.\"\n\nQiu Zeng bowed his head before the Dao: \"In my former life, I was fortunate to be born into the world of the Dao, encountering the Heavenly Perfected. Though I dwelt in the hidden chamber, my form reeked and my bones were foul, yet within the sacred altar my spirit was awakened, my heart responding beyond the body. I cast aside my remains and entrusted my life, hoping for even the slightest salvation. The Most High’s mysterious gaze turned to deliver me—having transformed my form, I now attend the Heavenly Worthy, and further, by the grace of the Southern Culmen, I have received the teachings of a master. Joy and awe fill my heart, yet I know not how to express them. I only pray for your fulfillment, illuminating what I have never heard, and bestowing upon me the jade instructions and treasured mysteries.\"\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord commanded the Vermilion Thearch’s numinous youth to open the nine-frost jade case and the seven-colored treasury, bringing forth two scrolls of the *Lingbao Vermilion Script Jade Instructions*, which he entrusted to the Southern Culmen to transmit to Qiu Zeng in accordance with their covenant. The assembled immortals witnessed the pact and all proclaimed its goodness.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Instructions of the Primordial Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven**\n\nThe *Five Chapters of the Primordial Vermilion Script* emerged within the Great Void before the radiance of heaven and earth, before the dawn of creation. They silently wove the primordial root, establishing the Three Luminaries and setting the Five Qi in motion. The five colors divided and shone, illuminating the five directions, appointing the Five Thearchs, and guiding yin and yang. They turned the pivot of the Nine Heavens, revolved the brilliance of the Five Stars, nurtured the Five Peaks to stabilize the earth, and nourished the Five Palaces to cultivate the spirit.\n\nThus, the Perfected constantly rely upon the first light of yang to guide the harmonious qi of the Nine Heavens above and draw the fragrant flow of Jade Springs below, summoning primordial essence to the Great Ultimate and calling the Five Thearchs to the numinous youth. Those who bathe in it do not decline; those who preserve it know no end. They reverse the myriad kalpas to renew themselves, safeguarding the Five Molars in their countenance—truly the wondrous instructions of Lingbao, the ancestral teaching of the myriad sages.\n\n**Method for Cultivating the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven of the East:**\nOn the day of *Lichun*, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face east, and bow nine times.

After visualization, consume them at once, thereby drawing in the vermilion qi to fill and overflow, while fragrant mushrooms and mysterious infusions pour into the Crimson Palace.

Enter the chamber in each respective direction, purify with a fast, visualize the forms of the Five Elders, and recite the incantations. Afterward, guide and ingest the names of the heavens according to each direction. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials will descend, jade maidens will attend, and the body will emanate light, illuminating the ten directions. Moving in and out, the Five Thearchs will bow in reverence, and the three realms’ administrators will welcome you. This rank corresponds to the titles of the Perfected of the Three Heavens.\n\nThis text is preserved within the Southern Garden’s Red Cavern and Five Cities. The immortal officials of the Three Heavens guard it in full, stored within a twelve-tiered immortal tower, encased in a purple jade coffer, inscribed on yellow gold tablets, sealed with cinnabar mushrooms and luminous grass, and stamped with the Central Seal of the Most High. It is only transmitted to those whose names are recorded in the immortal registers, inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace, and destined to become the Perfected of the Three Heavens. Without such inherent endowment, one will never glimpse its pages. By ancient statutes, it is transmitted once every four hundred years.\n\nAt cock’s crow, compose the body and settle the spirit, then proceed in order. First ingest the green-toothed qi of the Eastern Direction, then the Southern, then the Central, then the Western, then the Northern, following the standard method of the Five Thearchs. When finished, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and conclude with the incantation:\n\n*\"White rock, sheer and steep,\nFlowing source, gushing spring,\nWashed with jade nectar,\nDrink and live forever,\nLifespan ever lengthening.\"*\n\nWhen done, stir the tongue around the upper, lower, and central parts of the mouth until jade mushrooms fill the mouth, then swallow three times in sets of three. Again draw qi twenty-five times, hold it to the utmost, and swallow. The Dao is now complete.\n\n**The Primordial Five Elders’ Visualization of the Five Peaks and Five Thearchs: Jade Formula for Summoning Spirits and Seeking Immortality**\n\nWhenever cultivating the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s true writs, visualizing deities and reciting immortal names, or seeking any desire, one will at times hear the Perfected of the Nine Heavens arrive at one’s chamber and attain the body of a divine immortal.\n\nOn the *jiayin* or *yimao* day after the Beginning of Spring, bathe, purify, and fast. At dawn, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, knock the teeth nine times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Green Thearch Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, surnamed Xuānqiū, personal name Mùlù. His form is nine inches and nine parts tall, wearing a green jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a green feathered flying robe, riding a green dragon, attended by twelve green-waisted jade maidens. He descends from the Eastern Direction into your chamber. After a long while, the Green Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within green qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the liver. Visualize the heart generating red qi to bathe and surround the liver palace. The green and red qi merge in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds in boundless mist. When you feel the liver suffused with warmth, swallow nine times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\n*\"Nine gates of the Eastern Heaven,\nWithin dwells the Primordial August One,\nWho enters and exits the Three Clarities,\nRoaming and feasting in the Flowery Chambers.\nPacifying and guarding the numinous peak,\nCommanding and dispatching Gou Mang,\nAbove entwined with green auroras,\nNinety million layers thick.\nAttended by feathered ranks,\nTwelve flying dragons,\nLeft served by green-waisted maidens,\nRight guarded by divine youths,\nHolding jade tablets and registers,\nInscribed with green writs.\nExamining and determining immortal names,\nReporting them to the Upper Palace.\nToday, O August King, is most auspicious.\nI present my petition:\nMy body bears the Red Writ,\nMy name enters the Thearch’s hall.\nI vow to attain divinity, I vow to attain immortality,\nRecorded in the green register.\nTurn back your numinous carriage,\nDescend into my chamber.\nThe two qi merge and blend,\nTransforming into an infant’s form.\nPacifying and governing the liver palace,\nSummoning radiant brilliance.\nNuminous splendor flows and bathes,\nMy face assumes a golden countenance.\nSeated, I attain spontaneity,\nSpirits and gods commune.\nMy body attains longevity,\nHeaven and Earth know no end.\"*\n\nWhen finished, draw green qi and swallow nine times.\n\nPracticing this Dao for nine years, the numinous officials of the Eastern Peak and the Green Thearch will descend in truth, sending nine green-waisted jade maidens to serve you, enabling communication with the Nine Heavens. Your parents in life and death, your karmic records and punitive labors, assigned to the Eastern Peak, will have their spirits re-entrusted, sins erased, and liberation attained, ascending to the Hall of Blessings. This method is wondrous and profound, a bridge between life and death.\n\nOn the *bingwu* or *dingsi* day after the Beginning of Summer, bathe, purify, and fast. At noon, enter the chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright, knock the teeth three times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Red Thearch Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Peak, surnamed Yán, personal name Yángguāng. His form is three inches and three parts tall, wearing a red jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a cinnabar feathered flying robe, riding a red dragon, attended by twelve red-jade maidens. He descends from the Southern Direction into your chamber. After a long while, the Red Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within red qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the heart. Visualize the spleen generating yellow qi to bathe and surround the heart palace. The yellow and red qi merge in primordial chaos, like blazing flames in resplendent light. When you feel the heart suffused with warmth, swallow three times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\n*\"Three qi of the Cinnabar Heaven,\nSouthern Upper Jade Gate,\nWithin dwells the great spirit,\nThe Numinous Lord Red Thearch,\nClad in cinnabar, girded with talismans,\nFlying patterns on feathered skirts.\nRiding a red dragon,\nJade chariot on crimson clouds.\nOn the numinous Mount Heng of the South,\nMyriad spirits hold him in highest reverence.\nEntering and exiting the Three Clarities,\nFeasting above in the Nine Mysteries.\nRed-jade maidens attend and serve,\nJade youths guard the Perfected,\nHolding jade tablets and registers,\nCrimson writs on jade slips.\nExamining and determining immortal ranks,\nReporting their weight to the heavens.\nToday, O Great King,\nThe numinous peak opens the immortal path.\nTurn back the myriad spirits,\nDescend into my three gates.\nTransforming into an infant,\nPacifying the heart and settling the hun-soul.\nThe two qi merge and blend,\nEntwining my life’s root.\nEver with Zhu Rong,\nRiding auroras,\nRoaming the Southern Heights,\nHeaven and Earth enduring forever.\"*\n\nWhen finished, draw red qi and swallow three times.\n\nPracticing this Dao for three years, the numinous officials of Mount Heng of the South and the Red Thearch will descend in truth, sending three red-jade maidens to serve you, fulfilling all petitions and granting every request. Your parents in life and death, your karmic records and punitive labors, assigned to the Southern Peak, will all be dissolved, criminal names released, and you will ascend to the Heavenly Offices. This method is wondrous and profound, opening the passage between life and death.\n\nOn the *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jichou*, or *jiwei* day after the Spring Equinox, Summer Solstice, Autumn Equinox, or Winter Solstice, bathe, purify, and fast. At sunset, enter the chamber, face the center, and bow twelve times. Sit upright, knock the teeth twelve times, and summon the body’s spirits. When finished, close the eyes and visualize the Yellow Thearch Lord of Mount Song of the Central Peak, surnamed Jué, personal name Pǔshēng. His form is one foot and two inches tall, wearing a yellow jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a yellow feathered flying robe, riding a yellow dragon, attended by twelve yellow-silk jade maidens. He descends from the Central Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the Yellow Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within yellow qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the spleen palace. Visualize the lungs generating white qi to bathe and surround the spleen palace. The yellow and white qi merge in primordial chaos, like yellow clouds swirling in the heavens. When you feel the spleen suffused with warmth, swallow twelve times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\nCentral Heaven’s Yellow Origin, sovereign over the Four Numinous Ones, earthly stems wù and jǐ of the Central Mountain, primordial essence of the Supreme Beginning—Great Spirit of the Yellow Thearch, ascending in a flying chariot drawn by three, twelve yellow dragons soaring to feast in the Three Clarities, jade maidens in attendance, divine youths as messengers, opening mountains to reveal charts, verifying immortals and fixing names, lingering upon the Central Peak, the Solar King dispenses numinous power, returning in a winding descent to pour and irrigate my form. In primordial chaos and transformation, the Ancient Thearch becomes an infant, settling and pacifying the Yellow Palace, its repository flourishing in splendor. My body bears wondrous hairs, radiant within and without. When perfected beings commune, I penetrate the Nine Clarities, ascend to join the Yellow Chariot, and fly upward to the Jade Court.\n\nConclude by drawing yellow qi and swallowing twelve times.\n\nPracticing this Way for twelve years, the numinous officials of the Central Peak and the Five Thearchs descend to your chamber, sending twelve Yellow-Silk Jade Maidens to open and communicate your passages, making your prayers heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal records and penal names bound to the Central Peak—all are untied and dispersed, criminal records obliterated, your name inscribed in the immortal register. You depart the earthly palace and ascend into the Hall of Blessings, opening the passage between life and death, delivering countless beings.\n\nPerform this on the gēngshēn or xīnyǒu day following the Autumn Equinox. At dusk, bathe, purify yourself, enter the chamber, face west, and bow seven times. Sit evenly and knock your teeth seven times to summon the spirits of your body.\n\nConclude by closing your eyes and visualizing the White Thearch Lord of the Western Peak Mount Hua, surnamed Hàojiū, personal name Yuáncāng. His form is seven inches and seven fen tall, wearing a plain-jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a plain feathered flying robe, riding a white dragon, attended by twelve White-Silk Jade Maidens. He descends from the Western Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the White Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within white qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the lung palace. Visualize the kidneys generating black qi to bathe and surround the lung palace. The white and black qi merge in primordial chaos, like auspicious clouds vanishing into the empyrean. When you feel the lungs suffused with warmth, swallow seven times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\nHeaven of the Seven Qi, the Pale Sovereign’s Golden Hall—Great Spirit of the White Thearch, pacifying and settling the West. The numinous mountain of Huàyīn, called the Divine King, clad in a white-feathered flying skirt, bearing banners and driving dragons, roams the Dark Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Palace. Overseer of the immortal registers, arranging the records of all directions, on auspicious days and propitious hours, myriad sages feast and descend, lingering amidst the Nine Rosy Clouds, scattering radiant splendor. Golden essence gleams, white stones surge. Opening the immortal’s vision of the numinous, the spirit spreads to the four quarters. Wishing for the Dao, wishing for immortality, wishing for life, wishing for longevity—when these highest wishes converge, none fail to prosper. Gathering and refining to penetrate the true, transform my form and appearance. Through spontaneous transformation, I soar with the qi, my body flying and bones light, ascending to the Purple Chamber.\n\nConclude by drawing white qi and swallowing seven times.\n\nPracticing this Way for seven years, the numinous officials of the Western Peak and the White Thearch descend in truth, sending seven White-Silk Jade Maidens to open your numinous passages and communicate your prayers, all of which are heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal records and penal names bound to the Western Peak—all are released and absolved, criminal records self-erased, your name inscribed in the immortal register. You depart the Five Paths and forever ascend to the Hall of Blessings, opening the passage between life and death, with blessings and felicity naturally arising.\n\nPerform this on the rénzǐ or guǐhài day following the Winter Solstice. At midnight, bathe, purify yourself, enter the chamber, face north, and bow five times. Sit evenly and knock your teeth five times to summon the spirits of your body.\n\nConclude by closing your eyes and visualizing the Black Thearch Lord of the Northern Peak Mount Heng, surnamed Fú, personal name Tōngméng. His form is five inches and five fen tall, wearing a dark-jade *tongtian* precious crown, clad in a dark feathered flying robe, riding a black dragon, attended by twelve Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens. He descends from the Northern Peak into your chamber. After a long while, the Black Thearch Lord transforms into the form of a newborn infant, within black qi, following the qi through your mouth to enter directly into the kidney palace. Visualize the liver generating blue-black qi to bathe and surround the kidney palace. The blue-black and black qi merge in primordial chaos, like azure clouds vanishing into mist. When you feel the kidneys suffused with warmth, swallow five times and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n\nHeaven of the Five Qi, primordial essence flowing from the Supreme Beginning, congealing qi and coagulating numen—called the Immortal’s Abode. Settling and pacifying the Northern Heng, where the Black Thearch roams, feasting in the Northern Solitary Realm, ascending with dragons in a floating chariot. Today is the Solar King’s auspicious day, myriad spirits open the charts. The Five Qi linger, auspicious clouds spread to the four quarters. Immortal youths hold the registers, the Supreme Mystery transmits the talismans, inscribing my immortal record, the Golden Register written above. Returning in a winding descent, merging with the infant, the two qi intertwine, thoroughly irrigating my body. Dark and profound, I grasp the handle, immortals as my companions, eternally enjoying Heaven and Earth, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nConclude by drawing black qi and swallowing five times.\n\nPracticing this Way for five years, the numinous officials of the Northern Peak and the Black Thearch descend in truth, sending five Supreme Mystery Jade Maidens to serve and command you, communicating your prayers and petitions, all of which are heard in the Nine Heavens. Parents of life and death, criminal names and penal records bound to the Northern Peak—all are absolved and released, enabling you to cross the Three Evil Paths and ascend to the Heavenly Hall. This wondrous and supreme method delivers boundless beings.\n\nIn practicing this Way, always maintain a calm mind and focused intention, making the numinous and true easily perceptible. Mastering its forms without deviation, year after year you will witness the spirits’ comings and goings, while heavenly officials welcome you, demonic spirits vanish and submit, daring not to approach. Your mind becomes keen and your thoughts wise, enabling you to discern good and ill fortune. The Five Peaks and Five Thearchs become your constant companions, spirits and deities communicate, and you swiftly attain immortality.\n\nThe *Yuánshǐ Língbǎo Wǔdì Jiàojì Zhāozhēn Yùjué* states: The Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Red Writings, each guarding a direction, are all spontaneous writings of the Yuánshǐ. The Five Elders attend the Five Thearchs in the five directions, with numinous officials overseeing the records, their prohibitions lifted once every three years for the assembly of immortals to celebrate the true. According to ancient statutes and former canons, the perfected of the Upper Palaces and the immortals of the Five Peaks, once every three years, offer to the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure: swans and egrets, fragrant wine, sweet fruits, and other offerings to the heavenly perfected, thereby sustaining the numinous qi.\n\nThose who consistently practice thus will move the spirits of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure, and the numinous officials of the five directions shall rejoice in response. In all rites, whether lavish or modest, what matters is the sincerity that arises from within—where there is utmost devotion, humans and spirits resonate. Thus, the forms and protocols are recorded here for secret cultivation.\n\nAccording to the ancient statutes for summoning the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure:\n- In spring, use the days of *jiǎyín* and *yǐmǎo*;\n- In summer, use *dīngsì* and *bǐngwǔ*;\n- During the four seasons’ transitions, use *wùchén*, *wùxū*, *jǐwèi*, and *jǐchǒu*;\n- In autumn, use *gēngshēn* and *xīnyǒu*;\n- In winter, use *guǐhài* and *rénzǐ*.\n\nOn the day of the *jiànwáng* ritual, construct a high altar upon a sacred peak, purifying the four directions. At the eastern, southern, western, and northern cardinal points, and at the central *wáng* position, open five gates and place five placards, each inscribed as follows:\n\n**Eastern Placard** (written in blue):\n*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*\nInstall at the eastern-facing gate.\n\n**Southern Placard** (written in red):\n*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*\nInstall at the southern-facing gate.\n\n**Central Placard** (written in yellow):\n*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials; Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*\nInstall to the left of the central *wáng* gate.\n\n**Western Placard** (written in white):\n*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*\nInstall at the western-facing gate.\n\n**Northern Placard** (written in black):\n*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*\nInstall at the northern-facing gate.\n\n**Placard for the Host of Perfected** (written in purple):\n*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials; [Invited to] the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the right.*\nInstall to the right of the central *wáng* gate.\n\nThese five gates correspond to the Five Qi Gates of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace. The immortals and host of perfected, when not entering through their respective directional gates, all pass through the Yellow Thearch’s gate on the right.\n\nOnce the five gates are installed, erect screens on all four sides to block the wind, preventing the firelight and qi from scattering. Keep the flames contained, avoiding excessive brightness that would disperse the numinous qi. Spread a five-foot mat and arrange it according to the season—facing east in spring. Prepare one swan or egret, thoroughly cooked. Offer five *dǒu* of fragrant wine, kept pure and aromatic. Present fruits according to abundance and rarity. Use eleven fine, new cups and ladles, with three sets of vessels: two sets of five cups each, and one set of a single cup, placed beneath the five-cup sets. Arrange five incense fires in sequence before the vessels, and three sets of fruits likewise. Reserve additional wine and meat in separate containers, placed before the seats.\n\nOn the altar, lay out five *chǐ* of cinnabar-patterned crimson silk and the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s True Writings along with the five talismans. Cut five *chǐ* of azure-patterned silk from the Azure Grove to cover the true writings and talismans, placing them behind the seats. Position the talismans within the cinnabar and azure silk, symbolizing the covenant of hair-cutting and blood-oath. The azure silk substitutes for hair, and the cinnabar for the blood-oath—perfected beings avoid harming their spirit or diminishing their virtue, hence these substitutes.\n\nPrepare five kinds of incense, blended together. Use new, fine censers, arranged in sequence. Kneel with sashes tied to invoke the deities. Speak softly and humbly, so that the heavenly perfected may descend in secret resonance. Inscribe six wooden tablets with cinnabar on white silver, inviting the Five Thearchs and the host of numinous officials, placing them beneath the five incense fires.\n\n**Invocation for the East:**\n*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Azure Teeth Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the South:**\n*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the Center:**\n*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the left.*\n\n**Invocation for the West:**\n*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the North:**\n*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the Host of Perfected:**\n*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you.*\n\nDescend through the Primordial Yellow High Morning Gate on the right. Place the five vermilion-written tablets beneath the five incense flames. After reading each tablet, invite one Thearch, bow twice, and deposit the tablet, proceeding in order according to the rite. The final tablet should be positioned to the right of the center. Once the Celestial Officials have all been sent off, bury the tablets in the five directions of the mountain. This is the ancient canon of the Mysterious Capital; the pattern must not be altered, lest the Heavenly Perfected fail to descend and misfortune befall the omen.\n\nAfter arranging the tablets, modulate your voice and declare of your own accord:\n*On the [day] of the [month] of the [year], [Your Name], Perfected of the Thearch of [Place], aged [number] years, having received on the [day] of the [month] of the [year] from [Name], Perfected of the [Peak] Peak, the Five Elder Perfected Writs of the Most High Numinous Treasure—Five Chapters of the Spontaneous Vermilion Script and Mandates—now, in reverent accordance with the ancient canon and ritual code of the Mysterious Capital, purify myself with fasting and ablutions, suffuse the divine chamber with incense, and humbly invite the Five Thearch Lords, the Five Thearch Numinous Officials, Perfected Ones, Divine Immortals, and Jade Maidens. With the solemnity of the wild goose and egret, I offer fragrant wine, sweet fruits, and pure sincerity, purifying body and spirit to receive the Most High August Heavenly Worthy. I beseech the dispatch of the Five Body Perfected Officials, the Three Hun and Seven Po, and the Three Palaces’ Perfected Ones to ascend to the Nine Heavens, to the palaces of the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the Five Outer Regions, the Azure Tooth Heaven, the Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Thearch’s Mountain, the Central Yellow Heaven, the Bright Stone Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Heaven, and the courts of the Five Thearch Perfected Ones of the Eight Directions. May they convey my entreaty, uphold the fast, and observe the rites with empty heart and reverent gaze, that the numinous chariot may turn and briefly descend to [Place], illuminating my sincere devotion. May the Perfected of the Five Talismans descend to partake of this humble offering.*\n\nConclude with two bows, prostrate for a long while, then rise to kneel. Take the Eastern tablet, read the text, and return it to its place. Again invite the supreme deities. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch Lord, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Southern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Southern Blazing Might Vermilion Thearch Lord, Vermilion Cinnabar Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Primordial Qi Venerable, Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Central tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Central Pivot-Embracing Yellow Thearch Lord, Great Thearch Perfected One, Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth-Aether Granary Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Central Great Thearch’s Court.*\n\nProceed to read the Western tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Western Radiant Soul Treasure White Thearch Lord, Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, Most High White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Northern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Northern Concealed Might Black Thearch Lord, Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Numinous Lord, Night-Shining Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the tablet for the Host of Numinous Ones in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Host of Numinous Ones of the Nine Heavens, Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains, Numinous Officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens, Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials.*\n\nFor each of the six positions of the Five Thearchs and Host of Perfected, bow twice, totaling twelve bows to welcome the Thearchs’ descent. Upon completion, send off the Thearchs, addressing them as *I humbly labor the [Title] Thearch*. Bow twice again, totaling eleven bows. The rite of libation concludes here.\n\nAfter inviting the Heavenly Perfected, offer wine five times and burn incense, then declare of your own accord:\n*I, [Your Name], by fortunate karmic affinity from past lives, have in this kalpa of the Nine Heavens been granted the grace to encounter this luminous era, wherein the Dao and its methods flourish. Thus, this unworthy self has been permitted to partake in the Five Chapters of the Vermilion Script, the Five Talismans, and the Treasure Scriptures. Since my presumptuous receipt of these, I have revered the Supreme Perfected, yearned for divine transcendence, yet my sincerity remains shallow and feeble, unable to move the numinous. I constantly fear my sinful self will sink into the clamor of defilement, drowning in the Nine Springs. Yet the Heavenly Compassion is vast; may it extend to my humble efforts, as I uphold faith and devotion, maintain perpetual fasting, contemplate the divine, cultivate goodness, and aspire to boundless deliverance. Yet my sincerity is narrow and weak, unable to manifest itself. The profound mysteries of the Numinous Writs and the distant majesty of the Heavenly Worthy deter me from presuming to approach. Today, on this auspicious day, I purify body and fast, offering sacrifice to the Five Numinous Ones, Five Elders, Five Thearchs, and all Lords and Venerables. I humbly labor the radiance of the divine, beseeching the Most True Heavenly Worthy to condescend to my lowly state with compassion and reverence. Overwhelmed by the Heavenly Light’s far-reaching gaze, which leaves nothing unseen, I now make this declaration. Following the ancient canon of my former masters, I have pledged in vermilion and ink, observing silence in my practice, daring not to divulge [the teachings]. Only after five times eight [days] may they be revealed, to secure the covenant of transcendence. May the Five Thearchs take heed: I seek the true talismans, scriptures, and charts, with divine attendants to guard and protect my person. Whether ascending mountains, traversing ridges, entering forests, or crossing ravines, may all my pursuits and aspirations be fulfilled. May metal and stone open, and divine spirits commune with me, granting all my wishes. In gathering herbs and fungi, may none remain hidden. May mountain spirits submit and conceal themselves, and all trials leave me unharmed. May tigers, wolves, and venomous stings not afflict me. May Jade Maidens and Divine Lads attend me in all directions. May the Five Thearchs’ numinous qi descend into my form, settling and stabilizing the Five Palaces, sharpening inner and outer senses, enlightening mind and intent, granting foresight of fortune and misfortune. May the Three Corpses vanish, the Nine Worms perish, and my body grow wondrous hairs, hastening my attainment of divine transcendence. I implore the Most August Great Thearch to bestow compassion upon this humble one among the masses, granting my entreaties. Overwhelmed by this vast grace, I dedicate myself to diligent service. With utmost reverence and awe, I prostrate and bow twice.*\n\nOffer wine three more times and prostrate. If there are private matters to declare, present them as you see fit. After stating your wishes, humbly labor the Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nThen honor the Southern Numinous Might Vermilion Thearch, Vermilion Tooth Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Primordial Qi Elder, Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nNext honor the Central Pivot-Containing Yellow Thearch, Supreme Thearch Perfected, Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth Granary Jade Maiden, Central Yellow Supreme Thearch Officials, and all Numinous Officials to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nThen honor the Western Radiant Soul Treasure White Thearch, Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nNext honor the Northern Concealed Marquis Black Thearch, Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Supreme Numinous Lord, Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nThen honor the multitude of numinous beings of the Nine Heavens, the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts and Numinous Mountains, the Numinous Officials and Earth Immortals and Jade Maidens of the Three Offices and Nine Treasuries of the rivers and four floods, and the Flying Immortals and Divine Immortals and Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nThe ritual of offering and libation is now complete. Retrieve the tablets and bury them beneath the five gates, with the tablets of the multitude of Perfected buried beneath the central gate.\n\nThis rite is performed once every three years, and three times in nine years, after which it ceases.\n\n---\n\n*Ritual of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writs and Jade Instructions for Transmission from the Mysterious Capital*\n\nThe Perfected Master of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious [such-and-such] Marchmount, your humble servant [so-and-so], prostrates and bows twice, kowtows in fear of death, and respectfully addresses the Jade Augustness of the Most High, Utmost Perfected, and Greatly Sagely Venerable Lords, the Five Elders of Primordial Beginning:\n\nYour humble servant, born in the lower world, has encountered karmic conditions in this life. Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, I have revolved without cessation. Yet by the accumulated blessings of former lives, my fortune has extended to the present body, allowing me to enter the Dharma-gate. My name is recorded in the imperial register of the Thearch, inscribed in the august scrolls, and my person bears the numinous tally. I have received the Golden Writs of the Three Caverns, the Purple Scripts and Vermilion Chapters of the Upper Clarity, and the Five Vermilion Writs of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious Five Chapters of True Writs.\n\nMy former master, the Perfected Master of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so] Lord, transmitted these to me for wearing upon my person. They guard and protect the Perfected, command qi and dispatch spirits, and enact the Orthodox Dao. By this grace, disasters have vanished and misfortunes have receded. My family and state enjoy peace, and the efficacy of the Dao has become manifest—its luminous Way should be transmitted.\n\nIn the past, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the [such-and-such] year, I ascended [such-and-such] Marchmount to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens, vowing that within forty years, I would transmit these teachings to one whose bones and appearance accord with the charts and who meets the ritual requirements.\n\nSince receiving the Dharma, the allotted years have been fulfilled. Now there is an advanced disciple, the Perfected of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so], born in the [such-and-such] year of the [such-and-such] life, aged [such-and-such] years, born in the [such-and-such] month. His fate belongs to the Eastern Dipper, his name is recorded on Mount Tai, and his register is kept by the Azure Marchmount. His qi and bones harmonize with the Perfected. He has already received the Numinous Writs of the Nine Heavens and the Upper Dharma, yet his understanding remains shallow and narrow. He has not beheld the origin of the Dao, nor plumbed the roots of Heaven. The Five Thearchs do not oversee him, and the Nine Heavens have not yet heard of him. Yet he has faithfully and arduously sought the cinnabar elixir, accumulating years of supplication. He has laid bare his heart in oaths, moving both humans and spirits.\n\nI now present twenty-four thousand coins of gold, corresponding to the twenty-four qi of life, along with nine taels of refined gold to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens. I offer forty feet of patterned silk for each of the Five Thearchs to entreat the Five Elders and Supreme Perfected.\n\nThese gold coins are not found in the Red Continent; I humbly request that various treasures be accepted as their equivalent to fulfill the required amount. I prostrate and make this entreaty, swearing a covenant for my seven ancestors, binding both life and death to this vow. Should I violate the mysteries of the Nine Heavens’ Upper Dharma, I accept death as punishment. In life and death, my parents and I will be consigned to the offices of ghostly officials, swallowing our voices and stifling our breath, daring not to speak.\n\nYour humble servant [so-and-so], with a sincere heart and earnest devotion, has been blessed by accumulated fortune to partake of the Numinous Writs. Having perused their scrolls and beheld their contents, I am fit to attain the perfection of the Dao. I have fasted and purified myself, ascended the numinous mountain, and sworn an oath before Heaven to transmit the Writs. Following the clear statutes, I now confer them upon this disciple.\n\nDaring not act presumptuously, I prostrate upon the altar of the Great Yang’s Numinous Platform and present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion text to make this known. May the High Numinous Venerable Lords, the Chancellors of the Nine Heavens, deign to reflect upon my petition and take pity on my sincere heart.\n\nShould the August Ones above deign to proclaim this, may the Heavenly Perfected of the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts, the Numinous Treasure and Primordial Beginning Great Spirits, deliver my nine generations of ancestors to ascend into the Southern Palace. May their withered bones be crowned and girdled, their decayed frames restored to bloom, and their exhausted souls, revolving in suffering, be transformed to enter the gates of immortality. May the spirits already ascended advance in rank within the immortal palaces, their names inscribed in jade, recorded in the golden registers and treasure repositories of the Nine Heavens’ immortal records.\n\nI entreat the Azure Tooth Azure Thearch of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, the Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct, along with the Azure Dragon troops and generals of the Jia-Yi offices, numbering nine hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Liver.\n\nI entreat the Vermilion Tooth Three Qi Heavenly Lord, the Primordial Qi Elder, the Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct, along with the Vermilion Dragon troops and generals of the Bing-Ding offices, numbering three hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Crimson Palace of the Heart.\n\nI entreat the Yellow Thearch of the Primordial Grotto’s Supreme Thearch Mountain, the Supreme Thearch Perfected, the Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth Granary Jade Maiden, the Central Yellow Supreme Thearch Officials, and the Numinous Officials, along with the Yellow Dragon troops and generals of the Wu-Ji offices, numbering twelve hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Spleen.\n\nI entreat the White Thearch of the Seven Qi Heaven, the Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, the Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct, along with the White Dragon troops and generals of the Geng-Xin offices, numbering seven hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Lungs.\n\nI entreat the Black Thearch of the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct, along with the Black Dragon troops and generals of the Ren-Gui offices, numbering five hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Kidneys.\n\nI entreat the Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts with their troops and cavalry, the Perfected Ones of the Four Waterways with their troops and cavalry, the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces with their troops and cavalry, and the divine immortals and flying immortals with their mounts, numbering nine hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body, dispersing through the offices and palaces to securely guard the physical form within the Five Viscera and Six Palaces, the Nine Palaces and Three Primes, following the protective and defensive qi, harmonizing the hun and restraining the po, preserving the spirit and nurturing the essence, gathering qi and refining the immortal, coagulating the marrow and transforming the bones, and refining the blood vessels into perfection.\n\nAt dawn, they ingest the primordial efflorescence and the five-toothed mushroom blossoms, rinse the Jade Pool, and let the fluids generate spontaneously, filling the interior and overflowing externally, their radiance and luminosity penetratingly bright. A circular image appears upon the neck, illuminating the ten directions. They roam the world, greeted by the officials of the Three Realms, the celestial and terrestrial deities of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, who bow in attendance and escort them. The myriad spirits guard the Perfected, summoning clouds and descending rain, commanding the Eight Might to summon dragons, performing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, instantly responding to the natural order.\n\nWhen the great kalpas cycle and vast calamities surge from the four directions, the body attains flight and traverses heavenly disasters. Amid the Eight Difficulties and a thousand perils with ten thousand poisons, all are dissolved and extinguished. Demons are vanquished and trials repelled, malevolent spirits slain and treachery severed. They perceive the hidden and the manifest, discern fortune and misfortune in reverse, and command the celestial officials. Sitting, they summon the divine immortals of the ten directions to arrive spontaneously, transforming their radiance and refining their form, sitting or standing at will, vanishing or appearing. They ascend to the Upper Clarity, accompanying their nine generations of ancestors to ascend the Nine Heavens together.\n\nAfter the disciple receives the Perfection, they close their mouth and cultivate in secrecy, awaiting the celestial Perfected. Fathers do not instruct sons; it resides solely within the self. After seven years and within forty years, if one encounters a person of immortal attainment, they shall report to the Nine Heavens for transmission, where the Four Controllers, Five Thearchs, and Three Officials will summon and examine the disciple’s nine generations of ancestors, overseeing the covenant and scrutinizing their conduct and adherence to the precepts, ensuring no violation of the celestial numina. In life and death, they shall attain immortality together.\n\nShould they transgress the celestial statutes, divulging the Perfected Texts midway, the living and deceased parents, along with the disciple’s own body, shall confess their sins before the Four Luminaries, enduring the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never daring to seek pardon. Before the disciple fully participates in the Great Rites, their thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins are beseeched for absolution. From this day forth, they renew their vows and present their petition, which ascends to be memorialized before the Supreme, the Cavernous Mystery, the Numinous Treasure, the Primordial Jade August, and the Five Elder Thearchs.\n\nMay they deign to bestow their luminous regard and universally inform the myriad spirits, all wishing the disciple’s name to endure as a Perfected One, illumined by the Three Luminaries and eternally abiding with the Five Qi. We implore the August and Venerable Supreme Dao of the Utmost Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Perfected, to discern and compassionately attend to this plea.\n\nYour servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates in submission, kowtowing repeatedly to memorialize this entreaty. Your servant, of the surname [X] from the prefecture and county of [Y],\n\nTo the Supreme, Primordial, August, and Venerable Supreme Dao; the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure; the Five Elder Jade August Thearchs; and the Great Sage, Jade August Sovereign.\n\nIn the year [Z], the month [A], and the day [B], presented at the Golden Dragon Post of [C] Mountain Peak in the prefecture and county of [D].\n\nThe ancient statutes of the Mysterious Capital confer the rites of the Upper Perfected, inscribed in vermilion upon yellow silk. When transmitting the scriptures and rites upon the numinous marchmounts, the texts are exposed for three days and three nights, undisturbed by wind or drifting, thereby deemed suitable for the Perfected. If encountered by wind, transmission is withheld. Should the texts be exposed to wind thrice, causing the memorial to flutter, such a person is deemed unsuitable, and transmission must not proceed. These celestial statutes are severe; master and disciple must together deliberate and exercise utmost caution, ensuring alignment with the celestial numina.\n\nHere ends the Lower Scroll of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Writ and Jade Instructions of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure of the Supreme*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra* (abbreviated as *Scarlet Script Jade Instructions*).\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient *Numinous Treasure Sutras*. Two scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Mystery Division, *Original Texts* category.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Instructions Sublime Sutra, Scroll One**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Five Elder Thearchs, and the Great Deities of the Ten Directions convened in the Upper Palace of Vermilion Yang within the Southern Cavern. They were seated upon seven-jeweled thrones of luminous pearls in seven hues. Then, the Five Thearchic Great Sages and the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, along with fifty-two thousand five hundred in assembly, approached the dais. Heavenly perfumes and blossoms rained down, divine dragons and celestial musicians—innumerable hosts—filled the air. Purple clouds spread in all directions, the Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, the Celestial Origin rejoiced in harmony, and the assembled perfected ones arrived in procession.\n\nAt that time, the diligent scholar Wang Longci, who had been granted attendance at the seat, entreated to receive the precepts and commandments. The Dao addressed Longci:\n\n\"For seven million kalpas, I have reverently cultivated the Numinous Treasure, established vows to bestow and disseminate, upheld the precepts, observed fasts, endured hardship without retreat, revolved through birth and death, practiced forbearance and diligence, severed heterodox thoughts, and embraced emptiness and non-conception. Through the accumulation of these practices, I attained the profound quiescence that elevated me to the honored rank of the Sagely Dao.\n\nEver moved by compassion, I desire to broadly deliver all beings—whether male or female, those of noble aspiration and utmost sincerity—so that all may behold the wondrous Dharma of the Numinous Treasure. You, possessing a virtuous heart, have come to seek refuge in the Dharma Gate. This is due to your past lives across ten thousand kalpas, wherein you already revered the Utmost Perfected. Your merit is complete, your virtue fulfilled, enabling your rebirth in the Dao-world at this time of flourishing Dharma.\n\nNow, I shall expound for you the *Ten Sections of Sublime Sutras on Resolving Obstructions*, that you may deliver the multitudes of the Ten Directions—celestial and human alike. Apply yourself diligently and take heed, lest you be swayed by demonic words.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"The causes and conditions of birth and death, the revolving of blessings and vows—none arise apart from the body. The human body is difficult to obtain, the Dao-world difficult to encounter, the sutras difficult to attain, and the decisive teachings difficult to hear. Why, then, do I unfold the profound purport and expound the essential words?\n\nMoved by compassion for the beings of the Ten Directions who, upon receiving birth, cannot preserve and deliver their bodies, dwell long in suffering and affliction, willingly tread the path of transgression, and revolve through the Five Realms—none awakening—I broadly illuminate the Dharma teachings to guide the ignorant and benighted. Thus, all celestial and human beings may enter the Gate of the Supreme Orthodox and Perfected, universally delivering all who are born into this world. By virtue of their past karmic connections, the perfected ones shall all be enabled to transcend.\n\nI have received the ancient sutras of the Original Beginning’s true scriptures, expounding the Dharma to deliver the world for ten thousand kalpas. I shall return to the Primordial Profound Joy Heaven. After this world passes into the Five Turbidities, when the mandate of destiny is obstructed, whether male or female, they shall not behold the luminous teachings. They will abide perpetually in the evil destinies, their lifespans devoid of opportunity, beset by sorrow and torment, enduring unjust suffering. Born and dying of themselves, they revolve through the Five Realms, falling into the Three Wretched Paths and the Eight Difficulties. Calamities and retributions pursue one another endlessly, and in the separation of birth and death, there is no distinction of noble or base—truly a cause for grieving the heart.\n\nNow, I expound these essential teachings to deliver those who can be delivered. You must rectify your mind and attentively receive my words.\"",

      "translated_text": "Then, having received the talismanic instructions, Long Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in reverent acceptance of the teachings.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"You who receive the Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure must rise and face north, your entire body prostrated upon the earth, paying homage to the ten directions. Then, turn eastward and listen in prostration to the Ten Precepts:\n\nFirst: Let your heart be free of malice and envy, without the hidden thieves of yin. Guard your speech and be mindful of transgressions, keeping your thoughts fixed upon the Dharma.\n\nSecond: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing; show compassion and succor all living beings. Let your kindness and love extend broadly to save all, bestowing moisture upon all things.\n\nThird: Maintain chastity and yield to righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, diminishing yourself to aid others.\n\nFourth: Be free of sensuality and desire; let your heart not wander. Preserve purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.\n\nFifth: Let your mouth be free of evil speech; your words neither ornate nor deceitful. Be loyal and upright within and without, avoiding transgressions of the mouth.\n\nSixth: Abstain from wine and regulate your conduct, harmonizing your qi and nature. Let your spirit not be harmed, and refrain from all evils.\n\nSeventh: Do not envy those who surpass you or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, delivering others before yourself.\n\nEighth: Do not criticize the scriptures or slander the sacred texts. Apply your heart to upholding the Dharma, ever as though standing before the gods.\n\nNinth: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor pass judgment on the four classes of beings. Let neither gods nor humans bear resentment, nor your spirit and qi be harmed.\n\nTenth: In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and a unified heart. Let harmony prevail between humans and gods, and let this be your constant practice.\n\nBy cultivating and upholding these pure precepts, you shall ever align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from this world of suffering. With reverence for the teachings, never grow lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil.\n\nThrough unwavering practice, you may extricate yourself from the Five Realms and avoid the Three Wretched Paths. You shall be protected by all heavens, revered by the myriad spirits, and by maintaining a perpetual fast and upholding the precepts, you shall naturally attain deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Dao continued: \"The Numinous Treasure reveals the Dharma to deliver beings, and there are twelve ways by which one may attain deliverance from the world. You should follow them, and by so doing, you shall naturally attain uprightness and ultimately enter the realm of non-action.\n\nFirst: Upon witnessing the true scriptures emerge to deliver all beings, arouse the intention for the Dao, and vow that in future lives you may ascend to the rank of Great Sage.\n\nSecond: Constantly practice a compassionate heart, wishing that all beings may behold the Dharma, be broadly and universally delivered, without obstruction or hindrance.\n\nThird: Delight in the scriptures and teachings, deeply and extensively studying them. Let your will be firm and your understanding clear, enlightening the ignorant and benighted.\n\nFourth: Reverently receive the instructions of your teacher, broadly exhorting and transforming others, guiding them into the Dharma gate, and distancing them from blind paths.\n\nFifth: Have faith in and turn toward the profound and wondrous, reverently upholding the scriptures and their instructions. Recite them morning and evening without weariness or slackening.\n\nSixth: Do not pursue glory and splendor, severing worldly entanglements. Focus your heart and stabilize your will, directing all your endeavors toward the Dharma.\n\nSeventh: Diligently recite the great scriptures, wishing for all beings, and broadly build bridges for them, creating karmic conditions for future lives.\n\nEighth: Constantly cultivate a good heart, neither perverse nor false, without envy, harm, evil, or malice.\n\nNinth: Wherever you are born, may you always encounter a sagely age, and may the teachings of the Numinous Treasure Dharma never be interrupted.\n\nTenth: Purify your body and uphold the precepts; perform fasts and establish merit. Broadly save all living beings, that all may attain deliverance.\n\nEleventh: Extensively study and broadly disseminate the scriptures and Dharma, preparing for the company of gods and humans, universally guiding and delivering all.\n\nTwelfth: Constantly encounter enlightened teachers life after life, receiving their teachings and propagating them, delivering countless beings.\n\nThese are the Twelve Wondrous Instructions. By cultivating these good thoughts, you shall life after life behold the sacred texts, form affinities with the Dao, and be recognized as friends by all heavens. You shall stride alone through the Three Realms, unobstructed, forever departing from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. Divine luminaries shall respect and protect you; earthly deities shall surround and guard you. Your gates and households shall be pure and solemn, and the myriad calamities shall not encroach. All your aspirations and vows, through the recitation of this scripture, shall be fulfilled.\n\nThis good man or good woman, with a sincere heart and reverent devotion, shall belong to the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, penetrating the natural and spontaneously attaining the ability to traverse water and fire, transform their form and shadow, and ascend to the Upper Clarity. Before their merit is complete and they should pass through extinction, they shall be welcomed by the Five Emperors and ascend directly to the heavenly palaces, bypassing Mount Tai. They shall be transformed and born into noble lineages, encountering the scriptures and the Dao, and thus attain deliverance from the world.\"\n\nThe Dao addressed Long Ci: \"Diligently practice and attentively receive these teachings; do not grow remiss.\"\n\nLong Ci bowed his head to the ground, prostrate in acceptance of the precepts.\n\nThe Dao declared: \"The true scriptures and incantations expound the supreme Dharma for deliverance. The ancient texts are profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail, and later scholars find them hard to apply. Therefore, I have annotated them in both elevated and plain styles to resolve obscurities. The jade instructions and true essentials elucidate the ancient texts, their subtle words and wondrous mysteries revered by all heavens. Upon reciting these jade chapters, the ten directions echo them from afar. In the heavens above, rituals are established; gods and demons are subdued, and ghosts and malevolent spirits are extinguished.\n\nFifty jade youths and fifty jade maidens attend the scriptures. From former lives through ten thousand kalpas, their names have been inscribed in the Supreme Mystery, yet they have not beheld these jade texts. Through the convergence of karmic conditions and encounters, they may attain immortality as divine transcendents. Their blessings extend to nine generations of ancestors, and their grace flows to distant descendants, all delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Realms, and the Eight Difficulties. This scripture is most noble and wondrous beyond compare.\"\n\n**The Numinous Treasure’s Method for the Water Emperor to Erase Sin Tablets**\n\nNuminous Treasure [Name] Emperor, Master [Name], aged [Number] years, born in the [Number] month, vowing to become a spirit immortal, to attain eternal life without death, and to preserve the Three Origins in unity.\n\nThe Nine Mansion Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the gods of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji rivers, and the great spirits of the Mingling, beseech the erasure of sin names, that they may be reported to the Nine Heavens.

Ascending to govern the Nine Heavens, we beseech the descent of jade texts. The sun, moon, and five stars; the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper; the Five Marchmounts at the center; the sacred mountains of the four quarters; the rivers and seas below; the Twelve Fountainheads; the Water Lords of the Nine Palaces; and the great spirits of the Mingling—today we make this supreme declaration. May all ten thousand vows be laid bare: we request to cast this jade tablet, beseeching the erasure of sin names. For our thousandfold and myriad ancestors, the nine clans and all kin—whose sins have entwined and stained even our own selves—may all be universally expunged, their roots of transgression severed and annihilated. Record their names in the Water Palace, proclaim them before the Lord on High.

Open the Three Southern Gates, receive the jade tablet, inscribe names upon the cinnabar register, erase the records of sins. Promote them to serve as imperial ministers. May the thousandfold and myriad ancestors, the nine clans and all kin, all attain liberation; may the Five Paths and Eight Difficulties be departed from, the Three Evils left behind. May souls ascend to the Nine Heavens, life and death be transcended, and all endure through ten thousand kalpas. Today we make this supreme declaration; may the myriad spirits all bear witness.

Today we make this supreme declaration; may the ten thousand immortals be destined for life. We vow for our divinity, for our immortality, beseeching to cast our jade names. May the August Sovereign of the Earth Palace eradicate our sins and punishments, present the tablet to the Upper Palace, and inscribe it in the registers of Splendid Azure.

Erase the records of past sins, proclaim names to heaven, performing each act three times. The Three Officials of the Heavens and the Nine Palaces of the Earth will entrust one another, distinguishing all above in heaven. The myriad spirits will reverently protect, the Five Emperors will attend and guard, the administrators of the Three Realms will receive and welcome. Gates and doors will be ordered and solemn; the earthly deities below and the heavenly spirits above, the sun and moon, will come to pay homage. The thousand demons and myriad spirits dare not rashly interfere. If your aspirations are firm and pure, all vows will be fulfilled. Your seven generations of fathers and mothers will immediately be liberated from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, ascending to the heavenly palaces. Life and death will be blessed, and retribution will correspond accordingly. The Three Officials and Nine Palaces record the merits and transgressions of people—this principle is most clear. Through generations of karmic conditions, not a hair’s breadth will be lacking. You must earnestly uphold and practice this, never growing lax, lest demons corrupt your true nature.\n\n*Eastern Nine Qi Azure Heaven True Script Red-Script Jade Formula*\n\nThe Nine Qi of the East, the August Azure Heaven, where verdant mists rise in layered ranks.

For all who initiate vows to seek the Dao, present petitions, or perform rites, none may proceed without first turning east, knocking the teeth thrice, and holding incense to recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Most High Venerable Lord, summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six each—to emerge from the passes. I now invoke this land’s earth spirits and the true officials of the four directions. As I burn incense and open the passes, may the qi of the ten directions’ true and numinous ones enter my body, that my supplications ascend and reach the presence of the Most High, Perfectly True, Greatly Sage, Honored Divine Jade Thearch.\"*\n\nFor all who study the Dao and make petitions, or cultivate the supreme methods, failure to first open the passes invites interference by demonic forces, preventing ascent—all efforts will lack resonance, the spirits will not witness them, and labor will be in vain.\n\n**The Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs and Jade Formulas**\nThe Dao states: Those who study the supreme methods, contemplate the spirits, and meditate upon the Dao—dwelling in mountains with tranquil intent, observing fasts, reciting scriptures, liberating the seven ancestors, and seeking transcendence for themselves—must practice the *Supreme Method of the Five Venerables’ Red Writ of True Writs*. According to the ancient texts, one must first knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Mysterious and Lofty Numinous Ones, Primordial Honored Spirits, Great Sages who wander, the myriad spirits attend the hall. The Three Radiant Ones spread their brilliance, auspicious clouds array the four quarters. I report to the celestial registers, ascending through the nine heavens. Today I initiate my vow, presenting my petition to the numinous mountain. Vermilion script and red characters, the spontaneous true writ, I report to the Five Thearchs, inscribing my name in the Jade Chapters. The myriad spirits bear witness, the sun and moon illuminate my words. May my vows for deliverance and rebirth, for spirithood and transcendence, be seen by the heavens, earth, and stellar lodges. May the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the great spirits of the Five Peaks, universally proclaim without end: sever my roots of sin. The Primordial opens all, none shall reject my words. May the seven ancestors’ imprisoned souls receive blessings spontaneously, forever departing the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, escaping the Eight Perils. May I join the Three Radiant Ones, shining with the Purple Dawn, revolving without end, attaining the flight of transcendence.\"*\n\nUpon completion, read the petition aloud, cast it into an abyssal cliff, then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain. Knock the teeth thrice more and recite toward your life’s origin:\n\n*\"The Primordial oversees and witnesses, my immortal name is inscribed. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus shall erase all sins. Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs, pledge alliance with the Great Void. As I have petitioned, may I abide for ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nConclude by inhaling nine qi and ceasing.\n\n**The Five Venerables’ Jade Formula for Dispelling Stellar Calamities and Illuminating Heaven’s Allotted Degrees**\nThe Dao states: The stellar lodges of the various heavens each hold allotted degrees. When their paths deviate or trespass, encroaching upon one another, or when omens appear in the four directions’ domains, these arise from the misfortune of celestial qi’s cyclical obstructions, forcing them beyond their allotted lands. Thus, the celestial light shifts to illuminate and mystically report the inauspicious.\n\nTherefore, the Primordial bequeathed this writ to harmonize heaven and pacify earth, dispel disasters and relieve afflictions, secure the state and tranquilize the people. Those of utmost sincerity must cultivate this method with devotion. On the day the calamity appears, inscribe the true writ as in the ancient method and expose it in the central courtyard. Face the afflicted direction, knock the teeth twelve times, loosen the hair, and raise a prayer:\n\n*\"Primordial of the Upper Heavens, the Three Luminaries’ lofty brilliance, revolving radiance illuminates the four directions’ clarity. Where the cyclical degrees clash, meteors surge and stream. The Five Borders transgress, the Three Systems lose peace. The Five Celestial Dipper’s total stars, the Seven Lodges’ numinous spirits, the True Lords and Great Leaders—whose tabooed name is Jade Essence—with the Empress and Royal Consort, styled ‘Nurturing Infant,’ together govern the Mysterious Pass, revolving the myriad heavens. Now, with this guest calamity, I mystically report the inauspicious. I present the true writ, the red script, to ascend in offering. With loosened hair, I confess my transgressions, revealing my vermilion sincerity. May the Mysterious One deign to witness, restoring the celestial canon. May qi not trespass, disasters not arise wantonly. I burn the numinous writ, scattering smoke in the Jade Court. The Upper Radiance oversees the degrees, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits. May the Three Passes’ qi be purified, the Nine Darks’ calamities be extinguished. Yin and yang harmonized, the land shall know great peace. I present this with golden dragons and wind-borne couriers.\"*\n\nConclude by exposing the true writ in the central courtyard and anchoring it with a golden dragon. If the calamity lies in the east, burn the true writ after nine days and nights, scattering the ashes in the blue smoke.\n\nFor all methods to dispel celestial calamities and pacify state and people, light lamps corresponding to the afflicted direction to illuminate the celestial lights. If the east is afflicted, light nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred—and use one liang and one piece of golden dragon. For eastern calamities, use ninety feet of blue silk over nine days and nights. For southern calamities, light three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred—and use thirty feet of crimson silk over three days and nights. For central calamities, light twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred—and use one hundred twenty feet of yellow silk over twelve days and nights.

Leave the top node empty to connect with heaven, and the bottom node empty to stand upon the earth. Seal the top node with wax and impress it with the *Primordial Beginning’s Seal*. Seal the bottom node with wax and impress it with the *Five Thearchs’ Seal*. Wrap it in a crimson silk sheath, its length and size sufficient to contain the staff. In lying down, resting, sitting, or rising, always keep it by your side. When moving about, you may remove the staff from its sheath, concealing it as you come and go, and place it separately when resting. Point the staff toward heaven, and heavenly spirits will render homage. Point it toward the earth, and earthly deities will receive and welcome. Point it toward the northeast, and myriad ghosts will bind their forms. When riding the staff to travel or intending to employ it, click the teeth thirty-six times and visualize the *Straight Talisman Officers* of the Five Thearchs, each clad in the color of their direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs, one each, together guard the staff on either side.

      "translated_text": "When finished, draw the qi of the Five Directions, swallowing each five times, totaling twenty-five swallows to conclude. Practicing this Dao for nine years with utmost diligence and reverence, the divine spirits will manifest in form, and the staff will carry one through the air. Should one seek liberation through the corpse, the staff will replace one’s form, and in an instant, one will become a Perfected. On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month and the eight seasonal nodes, burn incense to the left and right, and pay homage to this staff—then the numinous spirits will descend in response, and the Dao will be accomplished.\n\n**Numinous Treasure Eight Might Divine Staff Jade Formula**\nInscribe in vermilion the *Three Heavens Supreme Venerable Summoning and Subduing Flood Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits Text* upon a silverwood board. Record the year, month, and the master’s surname and given name on another board. Bind the two boards together and enclose them in a pouch. Inscribe the following text in vermilion on another board and place it outside the pouch. Altogether, three boards are sealed to form the Divine Staff, as in the transmission’s form. All boards must be made of silverwood, one foot and four inches in length, two inches and four fen in width. Use crimson silk to make a pouch twelve feet in length, wrapping it around the outer board, and impress the seal of the Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders at the lower end. Encase it in a sterculia wood box, clad in crimson silk, and store it in a separate chamber with the invocation text for the staff. Burn incense to the left and right, and reverently attend to it. When received, wear it on the body. All divine spirits under heaven will attend at the gates day and night, accompanied by twelve Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors. When traveling, the Five Emperors will serve as guards, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you. No longer will you face the three evil destinies in life or death; you will bypass Mount Tai and ascend directly to the Nine Heavens. Clothing and sustenance will come naturally, and your rank will equal that of the Great Ultimate. Ultimately, you will attain immortality.\n\nWhen a Daoist adept wears this text and employs the divine incantations, pointing the staff text toward heaven, the heavenly spirits will offer rites. Pointing it toward earth, the earth spirits will bow in reverence, and the Three Realms will gird their sashes. Pointing it toward spirits, they will pay homage. Pointing it toward ghosts, they will perish and scatter. Pointing it toward water, the water spirits will clear the way. When great kalpas intersect and floods converge from all directions, use the staff to summon dragons, and they will bear you upon their backs. Through long cultivation and accumulated resonance, divine spirits will gather in response—wherever you invoke them, they will arrive instantly. A thousand transformations and ten thousand wonders will follow your will. In your comings and goings through the years, your rank will be that of the Great Ultimate. You will be preceded by flying dragons and guided by the Celestial Pivot, with phoenixes wailing and simurghs singing, twelve radiant blossoms, and the banners of the Three Sevens. After nine years of focused practice, the celestial regalia will naturally be complete.\n\n**Incantation of the Numinous Treasure Eight Might Divine Staff:**\n*\"Supreme Perfected of the Primordial Beginning,\nFive Numinous Ones of exalted honor,\nGreat Flower’s luminous radiance,\nPervading brightness through the Eight Gates.\nThe Five Elders proclaim the decree,\nNo hidden place beyond their reach.\nAbove, they govern the Nine Heavens;\nAt the center, they command Mount Feng;\nBelow, they oversee rivers and seas,\nThe twelve water sources.\nThe Eight Might Divine Incantation,\nNuminous Staff Jade Text—\nSummon dragons to bear the waters,\nGather qi and assemble clouds,\nBind demons and dispatch ghosts,\nSweep away demonic hordes.\nTen thousand spirits crumble,\nNone escape destruction.\nSun, moon, and Five Stars,\nNorthern Dipper’s Seven Origins,\nAll heavens, all earths,\nAll waters, all mountains,\nThe Jade Perfected’s retinue,\nVast and profound great spirits,\nImmortal Kings at their banquets,\nFive Emperors’ staffs and banners,\nCelestial Soldiers leading the way,\nGolden Tigers rushing behind,\nMighty beasts of the Heavenly Apes,\nArrayed at the Four Passes.\nWhat is called arrives instantly,\nWhat is summoned stands before you.\nVermilion script blazes forth,\nWind and fire unceasing.\nAll that is commanded is verified,\nTransmitted by Golden Dragons.\"*\n\nWhen finished, knock the teeth nine times, raise the head and roar thrice toward heaven, draw the celestial qi three times, and point the staff text toward the designated place. Hold the breath for nine cycles, then cease.\n\n**Primordial Beginning Five Elders’ Numinous Stabilizing, Immortality-Seeking, and Disaster-Averting Vermilion Script Jade Formula**\nWhen a Daoist engages in reclusive study, inscribe the Vermilion Script of the Azure Emperor and place it in the East—then the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount will arrive. After a hundred days of fasting and focused meditation upon the Numinous Treasure Venerable Spirits, the Heavenly Perfected will descend, granting nine Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens to gather the Eastern Marchmount’s divine immortality-bestowing lingzhi herbs. The Azure Emperor’s demonic forces will retreat ninety thousand li, and all malevolent influences, ferocious beasts, and venomous creatures in the region will cease their harmful intentions, instead showing kindness to the virtuous. After twenty-four years of fasting and cultivation, one will attain divine immortality. Merely wearing this text will also allow one to achieve liberation through the corpse and transform into an immortal. If the land in the East or during the three months of spring faces calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the eastern region, inscribe the Vermilion Script upon green stone and place it in the East for nine days—the disaster will vanish, and malevolent rebellions will dissolve. The region will flourish with virtuous people, green dragons will soar, and auspicious omens will arrive spontaneously, bringing great peace to the land. Wearing the inscribed text will avert all misfortunes, shield one from untimely harm, and keep one in constant alignment with the divine. It will protect the nation and secure the household, ensuring boundless blessings.\n\nWhen a Daoist inscribes the Vermilion Script of the Crimson Emperor and places it in the South, the immortals of the Southern Marchmount will arrive. After a hundred days of fasting and focused meditation upon the Numinous Treasure Venerable Spirits, the Heavenly Perfected will descend, granting three Vermilion Mound Jade Maidens to gather the Southern Marchmount’s divine immortality-bestowing lingzhi herbs. The Crimson Emperor’s demonic forces will retreat thirty thousand li, and all malevolent influences, ferocious beasts, and venomous creatures in the region will cease their harmful intentions, instead showing kindness to the virtuous. After twenty-four years of fasting and cultivation, one will attain divine immortality. Merely wearing this text will also allow one to achieve liberation through the corpse and transform into an immortal. If the land in the South or during the three months of summer faces calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the southern region, inscribe the Vermilion Script upon red stone and place it in the South for three days—the disaster will vanish, and malevolent rebellions will dissolve. The region will flourish with virtuous people, and auspicious omens will manifest brilliantly: phoenixes will come to welcome, simurghs and cranes will soar and sing, heavenly beings will chant in joy, and the nation will enjoy great peace. Wearing the inscribed text will prevent all disasters, dispel misfortune and defilement, and effortlessly summon divine spirits. Blessings will be boundless, life will be prolonged, households will prosper, and the nation will remain secure.\n\nWhen a Daoist inscribes the Vermilion Script of the Yellow Emperor and places it in the Center, the immortals of the Central Marchmount will arrive. After a hundred days of fasting and focused meditation upon the Numinous Treasure Venerable Spirits, the Heavenly Perfected will descend, granting twelve Yellow-Silk Jade Maidens to gather the Central Marchmount’s divine immortality-bestowing lingzhi herbs.",

      "translated_text": "Within the Five *Qi* Mysterious Heaven resides the Primordial Black Numinous Lad, named Yuzī, who oversees the Vermilion Script of the Black Emperor. The Black Numinous Lad is five inches tall, clad in black feathered robes, and holds a black banner, standing behind the text. Practitioners should meditate upon this spirit descending into their body; after a hundred days of focused contemplation, the numinous perfected will manifest, and prayers will be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true text will have this lad ever present within their kidney palace, bestowing the essence of black *qi*.\n\nThese Five Thearch Numinous Lads, born together with the Primordial Five Elders, govern the Five Chapters of the True Text. Above, they command the *qi* of the Nine Heavens; below, they preside over the Five Marchmounts; and within, they master the five viscera, drawing the essence of the Five *Qi* to nourish the human body. Those who ingest the Five *Qi* yet remain ignorant of these spirits will ultimately fail to receive response, their efforts spent in vain.\n\nThus concludes the *Upper Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Lower Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Script and Jade Formulae of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*\n\nThe Primordial Thearch, the Numinous Treasure Venerable Divinity, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct customarily visit the Southern Thearch’s Cavernous Yang Palace thrice yearly to audit the celestial origins, reckon the kalpas’ conjunctions, and unveil the Vermilion Script of the Five Elders’ True Text, sealing it upon jade tablets to bestow upon the Five Thearchs.\n\nThe Five *Qi* of the Primordial Thearch regularly ascend at cock’s crow to convene at the Numinous Treasure’s Jade Capital and the Mysterious Metropolis’ Upper Palace. As the yang light first brightens, it scatters the radiance of the Primordial Thearch, surveying the myriad heavens. Its *qi* is lush and luxuriant, its brilliance warm and pervasive, its essence like moonlit pearls, its light like purple clouds. The Five *Qi* revolve like a chariot’s wheel, ascending to govern the gates of the Nine Heavens, securing the numinous mountains of the Five Thearchs in the center, and descending to infuse the roots of the Five *Qi* within the scholars. The assembly of sages and Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace all partake of its radiance at that hour, inhaling its essence, aligning with heaven to attain boundlessness.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord requested the transcription of this text to transmit it to the utmost perfected. According to the Mysterious Regulations of the Numinous Treasure, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. Thus, the Numinous Treasure’s illumination emerges to deliver beings through the Dharma.\n\nThe Ten Directions’ Great Sage Venerable Divinities and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct convened together at the Three Primes’ Cavern Chamber on the Crimson Glow’s Slope in the Southern Garden, sealing the jade tablets. The host of perfected attended in assembly, with fragrant flowers, ritual music, and fifty million in attendance. The True Text shone resplendently, its luminosity penetrating within and without. The Five *Qi* surveyed the radiance, illuminating all directions. Cloudscapes were clear and bright, like the moon amidst stars, their wondrous forms and manifold excellences beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, in the Northern Chamber, there was a diligent and worthy man named Wang Fudu. He had a daughter named Aqiuceng, aged sixteen, who was then in the bathhouse, washing herself with fragrant water. She saw a golden light curving and shining, suspecting something unusual. She exited the chamber, climbed the wall, and gazing southward, beheld the Perfected of the Dao. Their divine essence blazed brilliantly, their countenance and luminosity outshone the sun. The girl rejoiced in her heart, clasped her hands in salutation, and called out from afar: “My name is Qiuceng. Today, I am fortunate to encounter this assembly, to behold the Heavenly Venerable, and to return my being to the Heaven within the Heavens of the Ten Directions. I beseech the precepts, to uphold and follow the Dharma texts, to eradicate all evil roots, to swiftly attain rebirth, to transform into a male form, and after ten thousand kalpas, to aspire to become a flying immortal.”\n\nThe Five Thearchs’ Demon Kings, seeing the girl make such a great vow, feared she might transcend their realm. They transformed into five elderly thearchs and approached the girl, saying: “We have received the mandate of the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions to convey to you the regulations of the Numinous Treasure’s Dharma. Our Dao is now spreading, and its Dharma promotes benevolence and love, with filial piety as its foundation. We have heard that your father intended to marry you off, having already accepted another’s proposal, which cannot be revoked. You should first comply with this, fulfill your human duties, and complete your rites and teachings. Thereafter, you may offer yourself. Heaven observes your heart; if you defy your father, there will be no means for the immortals to deliver you.”\n\nThe girl replied to the demons: “In my past life, I was unfortunate, lacking karmic conditions, and my merits and virtues were insufficient, resulting in my rebirth as a woman. From dawn to dusk, I repent and reflect, vowing to maintain a single heart, my resolve firm and arising naturally. My life comes from my parents, but my destiny lies with the Ten Heavens. Though I sincerely defy my father’s teachings, it is not as you say.” The demons, seeing the girl’s steadfast heart and upright conduct, could not sway her, and thus retreated.\n\nQiuceng declared: “The Dao is lofty and remote, and I have no means to attain it. I shall gather firewood, climb the wall, and burn my body, hoping that my form may become flying ashes, carried by the wind to descend before the Dao.” Thereupon, the fire ignited. Qiuceng clasped her hands toward heaven and said: “Venerable Ones of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Heavens, today I return my form to the Heaven within the Heavens. May I attain timely liberation, to disperse like dust.” She then cast herself into the fire. Suddenly, she felt no attachment, her body as if treading empty space. In an instant, she saw her female form transform into a male, who proceeded directly before the Dao and there received the precepts.\n\nThe Primordial Thearch then commanded the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen to be the girl’s master, transmitting to her the True Text. He assigned three hundred Jade Maidens of Great Florescence and three hundred Jade Lads of Golden Dawn, all adorned with the thirty-two marks, their brilliance illuminating the girl’s body. The Dao addressed the Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen: “This girl, in her past life, had already revered the Numinous Treasure. After ten thousand kalpas of rebirth, she has now been reborn among humans. Upon witnessing my revelation of the Dharma, she immediately attained transformation of form. She shall further deliver ninety-nine thousand beings before attaining the rank of Great Perfected Divinity.”\n\nAt that time, all beings—whether male or female—awakened to the intent of the True Dao, none failing to diligently uphold the fasts and precepts, cultivate and follow the Numinous Treasure. With utmost aspiration in their crowns, all attained deliverance from the world.\n\nThe Dao addressed Aqiuceng: “The Venerable Divinity of the Southern Culmen was once also a woman, born in the world of Chanli within the Crimson Brightness Heaven. She performed great merits, praised by all heavens. Before her Dao could be accomplished, she encountered the kalpa of fire, when heaven and earth exchanged positions, and she was among those cast aside. The Southern Culmen was moved by her utmost sincerity, and the Vermilion Palace inscribed her purple name. Her form was transformed within the womb of the Primordial Lady. After one kalpa, she was reborn as a male, dwelling in the Seven-Colored Jeweled Grove of the Upper Bright Pearl Palace in the Southern Vermilion Cavernous Yang. She studied under the Red Thearch’s Brahma Treasure and the Perfected Elder of the Vermilion Yang of the Flourishing Sun. Having mastered the Vermilion Script, she ascended to the rank of the Southern Culmen.”",

All this arises from the karmic conditions of your past lives. You must diligently cultivate the supreme practice, broadly deliver heaven and humanity, and when your merits are complete and your virtue perfected, you shall naturally ascend to the rank of Perfected, transcend the Three Clarities, swiftly traverse the Nine Radiant Mists, and attend the court of the Great Mystery.\"\n\nQiu Zeng bowed his head before the Dao: \"In my former life, I was fortunate to be born into the world of the Dao, encountering the Heavenly Perfected. Though I dwelt in the hidden chamber, my form reeked and my bones were foul, yet within the sacred altar my spirit was awakened, my heart responding beyond the body. I cast aside my remains and entrusted my life, hoping for even the slightest salvation. The Most High’s mysterious gaze turned to deliver me—having transformed my form, I now attend the Heavenly Worthy, and further, by the grace of the Southern Culmen, I have received the teachings of a master. Joy and awe fill my heart, yet I know not how to express them. I only pray for your fulfillment, illuminating what I have never heard, and bestowing upon me the jade instructions and treasured mysteries.\"\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord commanded the Vermilion Thearch’s numinous youth to open the nine-frost jade case and the seven-colored treasury, bringing forth two scrolls of the *Lingbao Vermilion Script Jade Instructions*, which he entrusted to the Southern Culmen to transmit to Qiu Zeng in accordance with their covenant. The assembled immortals witnessed the pact and all proclaimed its goodness.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Instructions of the Primordial Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven**\n\nThe *Five Chapters of the Primordial Vermilion Script* emerged within the Great Void before the radiance of heaven and earth, before the dawn of creation. They silently wove the primordial root, establishing the Three Luminaries and setting the Five Qi in motion. The five colors divided and shone, illuminating the five directions, appointing the Five Thearchs, and guiding yin and yang. They turned the pivot of the Nine Heavens, revolved the brilliance of the Five Stars, nurtured the Five Peaks to stabilize the earth, and nourished the Five Palaces to cultivate the spirit.\n\nThus, the Perfected constantly rely upon the first light of yang to guide the harmonious qi of the Nine Heavens above and draw the fragrant flow of Jade Springs below, summoning primordial essence to the Great Ultimate and calling the Five Thearchs to the numinous youth. Those who bathe in it do not decline; those who preserve it know no end. They reverse the myriad kalpas to renew themselves, safeguarding the Five Molars in their countenance—truly the wondrous instructions of Lingbao, the ancestral teaching of the myriad sages.\n\n**Method for Cultivating the Green Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Ninefold Azure Heaven of the East:**\nOn the day of *Lichun*, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright and click your teeth nine times. Visualize the Eastern Azure Treasure Flower Grove and the Azure Numinous Origin Elder Lord, whose surname is Men, personal name Kaiming, and style Lingweiyang. His form is nine inches tall, crowned with a cyan essence-jade coronet, clad in a ninefold qi azure feathered flying robe. He rides a chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing a quail banner, attended by ninety thousand officials of Jia-Yi and the Dark Elders, descending from the Nine Qi Azure Heaven into your chamber.\n\nIn an instant, azure qi is born, billowing like layered clouds, bathing your form. It enters through your mouth and descends directly into the liver palace. Then visualize the virtue of wood, shining brilliantly in the east, its light illuminating your body until all is distinct.\n\nWhen finished, open your eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:\n*\"Nine Qi Azure Heaven, primordial essence of the Primordial Beginning,\nAugust Elder Divine Lord, clad in azure feathers,\nPresiding over the celestial palace, shining like Jupiter,\nScattering radiance and flowing fragrance, refining my form.\nAbove, I feast on dawn’s mist; below, I guide the essence of wood.\nI fortify and nourish the Green Molar, preserving decaying years.\nMy liver palace overflows, jade mushrooms sprout naturally.\nReversing a hundred million kalpas, my complexion returns to youth.\nThe Five Qi harmonize, heaven and earth endure together.\"*\n\nWhen finished, guide the azure qi and swallow it nine times, then ingest the twelve characters of the Eastern Vermilion Script Jade Text.\n\nThese twelve characters are the names of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven. Guide the qi of the Azure Thearch and ingest the Green Molar—write them in vermilion on white paper, visualize them, then swallow them whole. The Nine Qi will descend of their own accord, the Azure Thearch will manifest at the sound of your voice, the Green Molar will be fortified in the Eastern Peak, and jade mushrooms will sprout in your liver palace.\n\nPlace the numinous youth in vigil beside your sleeping quarters, with azure-clad attendants serving for nine years. Through accumulated resonance and transformation, you will swiftly attain immortality and transcend the world, standing unshaken for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nAt cock’s crow, when the yang light first divides, face east and click your teeth nine times. Rub your palms until warm, then wipe your face nine times. Recite the incantation while looking upward:\n*\"Eastern Green Molar, ingesting the Green Molar,\nDrinking the morning’s blossoms.\"*\n\nWhen finished, use your tongue to stroke the outer edge of your upper teeth three times, then lick your lips three times, filling your mouth with Jade Spring and swallowing it three times. Guide the azure qi nine times to settle within your liver. This completes the method.\n\n---\n\n**Jade Instructions of the Primordial Vermilion Script: Ingesting the Vermilion Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Threefold Cinnabar Heaven**\n\n**Method for Cultivating the Vermilion Molar and Guiding the Qi of the Threefold Cinnabar Heaven of the South:**\nOn the day of *Lixia*, at cock’s crow, enter your chamber, face south, and bow three times. Sit upright and click your teeth three times. Visualize the Southern Brahma Treasure Flourishing Yang Vermilion Numinous Elder Lord, whose surname is Dongfu, personal name Jiyan, and style Chibiaonu. His form is three inches tall, crowned with a cinnabar essence-jade coronet, clad in a threefold qi vermilion feathered flying robe. He rides a chariot drawn by cinnabar dragons, bearing a vermilion banner, attended by three hundred thousand officials of Bing-Ding and the Luminous Elders, descending from the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven into your chamber.",

      "translated_text": "Those who consistently practice thus will move the spirits of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure, and the numinous officials of the five directions shall rejoice in response. In all rites, whether lavish or modest, what matters is the sincerity that arises from within—where there is utmost devotion, humans and spirits resonate. Thus, the forms and protocols are recorded here for secret cultivation.\n\nAccording to the ancient statutes for summoning the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs of the Numinous Treasure:\n- In spring, use the days of *jiǎyín* and *yǐmǎo*;\n- In summer, use *dīngsì* and *bǐngwǔ*;\n- During the four seasons’ transitions, use *wùchén*, *wùxū*, *jǐwèi*, and *jǐchǒu*;\n- In autumn, use *gēngshēn* and *xīnyǒu*;\n- In winter, use *guǐhài* and *rénzǐ*.\n\nOn the day of the *jiànwáng* ritual, construct a high altar upon a sacred peak, purifying the four directions. At the eastern, southern, western, and northern cardinal points, and at the central *wáng* position, open five gates and place five placards, each inscribed as follows:\n\n**Eastern Placard** (written in blue):\n*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*\nInstall at the eastern-facing gate.\n\n**Southern Placard** (written in red):\n*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*\nInstall at the southern-facing gate.\n\n**Central Placard** (written in yellow):\n*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials; Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*\nInstall to the left of the central *wáng* gate.\n\n**Western Placard** (written in white):\n*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*\nInstall at the western-facing gate.\n\n**Northern Placard** (written in black):\n*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials; Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*\nInstall at the northern-facing gate.\n\n**Placard for the Host of Perfected** (written in purple):\n*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials; [Invited to] the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the right.*\nInstall to the right of the central *wáng* gate.\n\nThese five gates correspond to the Five Qi Gates of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace. The immortals and host of perfected, when not entering through their respective directional gates, all pass through the Yellow Thearch’s gate on the right.\n\nOnce the five gates are installed, erect screens on all four sides to block the wind, preventing the firelight and qi from scattering. Keep the flames contained, avoiding excessive brightness that would disperse the numinous qi. Spread a five-foot mat and arrange it according to the season—facing east in spring. Prepare one swan or egret, thoroughly cooked. Offer five *dǒu* of fragrant wine, kept pure and aromatic. Present fruits according to abundance and rarity. Use eleven fine, new cups and ladles, with three sets of vessels: two sets of five cups each, and one set of a single cup, placed beneath the five-cup sets. Arrange five incense fires in sequence before the vessels, and three sets of fruits likewise. Reserve additional wine and meat in separate containers, placed before the seats.\n\nOn the altar, lay out five *chǐ* of cinnabar-patterned crimson silk and the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s True Writings along with the five talismans. Cut five *chǐ* of azure-patterned silk from the Azure Grove to cover the true writings and talismans, placing them behind the seats. Position the talismans within the cinnabar and azure silk, symbolizing the covenant of hair-cutting and blood-oath. The azure silk substitutes for hair, and the cinnabar for the blood-oath—perfected beings avoid harming their spirit or diminishing their virtue, hence these substitutes.\n\nPrepare five kinds of incense, blended together. Use new, fine censers, arranged in sequence. Kneel with sashes tied to invoke the deities. Speak softly and humbly, so that the heavenly perfected may descend in secret resonance. Inscribe six wooden tablets with cinnabar on white silver, inviting the Five Thearchs and the host of numinous officials, placing them beneath the five incense fires.\n\n**Invocation for the East:**\n*Nine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Peaceful Treasure Flourishing Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder, Azure Thearch; Azure Teeth Nine Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Perfected Kings; Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens; Eastern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the South:**\n*Three Qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, Brahmā-Treasure Radiant Prosperity, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder, Red Thearch; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lords; Primordial Qi Venerable; Vermilion Palace Grand Cinnabar Jade Maidens; Southern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the Center:**\n*Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch’s Mountain, Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder, Yellow Thearch; Supreme Thearch Perfected; Vermilion Elixir Yellow Court Wuji Heavenly Granary Jade Maidens; Central Yellow Supreme Thearch’s Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate on the left.*\n\n**Invocation for the West:**\n*Seven Qi of the Heavens, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder, White Thearch; Bright Stone Seven Qi Ministers; Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maidens; Western Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Penetrating Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the North:**\n*Five Qi of the Mysterious Heavens, Cavern Yin Solitary Obscurity, Five Numinous Dark Elder, Black Thearch; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lords; Supreme Numinous Lords; Night-Shining Jade Maidens; Northern Precinct’s Numinous Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you to descend through the Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*\n\n**Invocation for the Host of Perfected:**\n*Nine Heavens’ Host of Numinous Ones, Perfected of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains; Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways; Numinous Officials, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials—[I,] Perfected of the Thearch [Name], [Your Name], bow twice before the five incenses, prostrate, and humbly invite you.*",

      "translated_text": "Descend through the Primordial Yellow High Morning Gate on the right. Place the five vermilion-written tablets beneath the five incense flames. After reading each tablet, invite one Thearch, bow twice, and deposit the tablet, proceeding in order according to the rite. The final tablet should be positioned to the right of the center. Once the Celestial Officials have all been sent off, bury the tablets in the five directions of the mountain. This is the ancient canon of the Mysterious Capital; the pattern must not be altered, lest the Heavenly Perfected fail to descend and misfortune befall the omen.\n\nAfter arranging the tablets, modulate your voice and declare of your own accord:\n*On the [day] of the [month] of the [year], [Your Name], Perfected of the Thearch of [Place], aged [number] years, having received on the [day] of the [month] of the [year] from [Name], Perfected of the [Peak] Peak, the Five Elder Perfected Writs of the Most High Numinous Treasure—Five Chapters of the Spontaneous Vermilion Script and Mandates—now, in reverent accordance with the ancient canon and ritual code of the Mysterious Capital, purify myself with fasting and ablutions, suffuse the divine chamber with incense, and humbly invite the Five Thearch Lords, the Five Thearch Numinous Officials, Perfected Ones, Divine Immortals, and Jade Maidens. With the solemnity of the wild goose and egret, I offer fragrant wine, sweet fruits, and pure sincerity, purifying body and spirit to receive the Most High August Heavenly Worthy. I beseech the dispatch of the Five Body Perfected Officials, the Three Hun and Seven Po, and the Three Palaces’ Perfected Ones to ascend to the Nine Heavens, to the palaces of the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the Five Outer Regions, the Azure Tooth Heaven, the Vermilion Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Thearch’s Mountain, the Central Yellow Heaven, the Bright Stone Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Heaven, and the courts of the Five Thearch Perfected Ones of the Eight Directions. May they convey my entreaty, uphold the fast, and observe the rites with empty heart and reverent gaze, that the numinous chariot may turn and briefly descend to [Place], illuminating my sincere devotion. May the Perfected of the Five Talismans descend to partake of this humble offering.*\n\nConclude with two bows, prostrate for a long while, then rise to kneel. Take the Eastern tablet, read the text, and return it to its place. Again invite the supreme deities. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch Lord, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Southern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Southern Blazing Might Vermilion Thearch Lord, Vermilion Cinnabar Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Primordial Qi Venerable, Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Central tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Central Pivot-Embracing Yellow Thearch Lord, Great Thearch Perfected One, Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth-Aether Granary Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Central Great Thearch’s Court.*\n\nProceed to read the Western tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Western Radiant Soul Treasure White Thearch Lord, Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, Most High White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the Northern tablet in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Northern Concealed Might Black Thearch Lord, Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Numinous Lord, Night-Shining Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct.*\n\nProceed to read the tablet for the Host of Numinous Ones in the same manner. Humbly welcome the descent of:\n*The Host of Numinous Ones of the Nine Heavens, Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks and Numinous Mountains, Numinous Officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Waterways, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens, Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, Divine Immortals, and all Perfected Officials.*\n\nFor each of the six positions of the Five Thearchs and Host of Perfected, bow twice, totaling twelve bows to welcome the Thearchs’ descent. Upon completion, send off the Thearchs, addressing them as *I humbly labor the [Title] Thearch*. Bow twice again, totaling eleven bows. The rite of libation concludes here.\n\nAfter inviting the Heavenly Perfected, offer wine five times and burn incense, then declare of your own accord:\n*I, [Your Name], by fortunate karmic affinity from past lives, have in this kalpa of the Nine Heavens been granted the grace to encounter this luminous era, wherein the Dao and its methods flourish. Thus, this unworthy self has been permitted to partake in the Five Chapters of the Vermilion Script, the Five Talismans, and the Treasure Scriptures. Since my presumptuous receipt of these, I have revered the Supreme Perfected, yearned for divine transcendence, yet my sincerity remains shallow and feeble, unable to move the numinous. I constantly fear my sinful self will sink into the clamor of defilement, drowning in the Nine Springs. Yet the Heavenly Compassion is vast; may it extend to my humble efforts, as I uphold faith and devotion, maintain perpetual fasting, contemplate the divine, cultivate goodness, and aspire to boundless deliverance. Yet my sincerity is narrow and weak, unable to manifest itself. The profound mysteries of the Numinous Writs and the distant majesty of the Heavenly Worthy deter me from presuming to approach. Today, on this auspicious day, I purify body and fast, offering sacrifice to the Five Numinous Ones, Five Elders, Five Thearchs, and all Lords and Venerables. I humbly labor the radiance of the divine, beseeching the Most True Heavenly Worthy to condescend to my lowly state with compassion and reverence. Overwhelmed by the Heavenly Light’s far-reaching gaze, which leaves nothing unseen, I now make this declaration. Following the ancient canon of my former masters, I have pledged in vermilion and ink, observing silence in my practice, daring not to divulge [the teachings]. Only after five times eight [days] may they be revealed, to secure the covenant of transcendence. May the Five Thearchs take heed: I seek the true talismans, scriptures, and charts, with divine attendants to guard and protect my person. Whether ascending mountains, traversing ridges, entering forests, or crossing ravines, may all my pursuits and aspirations be fulfilled. May metal and stone open, and divine spirits commune with me, granting all my wishes. In gathering herbs and fungi, may none remain hidden. May mountain spirits submit and conceal themselves, and all trials leave me unharmed. May tigers, wolves, and venomous stings not afflict me. May Jade Maidens and Divine Lads attend me in all directions. May the Five Thearchs’ numinous qi descend into my form, settling and stabilizing the Five Palaces, sharpening inner and outer senses, enlightening mind and intent, granting foresight of fortune and misfortune. May the Three Corpses vanish, the Nine Worms perish, and my body grow wondrous hairs, hastening my attainment of divine transcendence. I implore the Most August Great Thearch to bestow compassion upon this humble one among the masses, granting my entreaties. Overwhelmed by this vast grace, I dedicate myself to diligent service. With utmost reverence and awe, I prostrate and bow twice.*\n\nOffer wine three more times and prostrate. If there are private matters to declare, present them as you see fit. After stating your wishes, humbly labor the Eastern Numinous Might Azure Thearch, Azure Tooth Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, Most High Perfected King, Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and all Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct to return to their divine chambers. Then scatter incense and bow twice.",

Then scatter incense and bow twice.\n\nThe ritual of offering and libation is now complete. Retrieve the tablets and bury them beneath the five gates, with the tablets of the multitude of Perfected buried beneath the central gate.\n\nThis rite is performed once every three years, and three times in nine years, after which it ceases.\n\n---\n\n*Ritual of the Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writs and Jade Instructions for Transmission from the Mysterious Capital*\n\nThe Perfected Master of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious [such-and-such] Marchmount, your humble servant [so-and-so], prostrates and bows twice, kowtows in fear of death, and respectfully addresses the Jade Augustness of the Most High, Utmost Perfected, and Greatly Sagely Venerable Lords, the Five Elders of Primordial Beginning:\n\nYour humble servant, born in the lower world, has encountered karmic conditions in this life. Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, I have revolved without cessation. Yet by the accumulated blessings of former lives, my fortune has extended to the present body, allowing me to enter the Dharma-gate. My name is recorded in the imperial register of the Thearch, inscribed in the august scrolls, and my person bears the numinous tally. I have received the Golden Writs of the Three Caverns, the Purple Scripts and Vermilion Chapters of the Upper Clarity, and the Five Vermilion Writs of the Numinous Treasure and Grotto-Mysterious Five Chapters of True Writs.\n\nMy former master, the Perfected Master of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so] Lord, transmitted these to me for wearing upon my person. They guard and protect the Perfected, command qi and dispatch spirits, and enact the Orthodox Dao. By this grace, disasters have vanished and misfortunes have receded. My family and state enjoy peace, and the efficacy of the Dao has become manifest—its luminous Way should be transmitted.\n\nIn the past, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month of the [such-and-such] year, I ascended [such-and-such] Marchmount to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens, vowing that within forty years, I would transmit these teachings to one whose bones and appearance accord with the charts and who meets the ritual requirements.\n\nSince receiving the Dharma, the allotted years have been fulfilled. Now there is an advanced disciple, the Perfected of [such-and-such] Marchmount, [so-and-so], born in the [such-and-such] year of the [such-and-such] life, aged [such-and-such] years, born in the [such-and-such] month. His fate belongs to the Eastern Dipper, his name is recorded on Mount Tai, and his register is kept by the Azure Marchmount. His qi and bones harmonize with the Perfected. He has already received the Numinous Writs of the Nine Heavens and the Upper Dharma, yet his understanding remains shallow and narrow. He has not beheld the origin of the Dao, nor plumbed the roots of Heaven. The Five Thearchs do not oversee him, and the Nine Heavens have not yet heard of him. Yet he has faithfully and arduously sought the cinnabar elixir, accumulating years of supplication. He has laid bare his heart in oaths, moving both humans and spirits.\n\nI now present twenty-four thousand coins of gold, corresponding to the twenty-four qi of life, along with nine taels of refined gold to swear an oath before the Nine Heavens. I offer forty feet of patterned silk for each of the Five Thearchs to entreat the Five Elders and Supreme Perfected.\n\nThese gold coins are not found in the Red Continent; I humbly request that various treasures be accepted as their equivalent to fulfill the required amount. I prostrate and make this entreaty, swearing a covenant for my seven ancestors, binding both life and death to this vow. Should I violate the mysteries of the Nine Heavens’ Upper Dharma, I accept death as punishment. In life and death, my parents and I will be consigned to the offices of ghostly officials, swallowing our voices and stifling our breath, daring not to speak.\n\nYour humble servant [so-and-so], with a sincere heart and earnest devotion, has been blessed by accumulated fortune to partake of the Numinous Writs. Having perused their scrolls and beheld their contents, I am fit to attain the perfection of the Dao. I have fasted and purified myself, ascended the numinous mountain, and sworn an oath before Heaven to transmit the Writs. Following the clear statutes, I now confer them upon this disciple.\n\nDaring not act presumptuously, I prostrate upon the altar of the Great Yang’s Numinous Platform and present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion text to make this known. May the High Numinous Venerable Lords, the Chancellors of the Nine Heavens, deign to reflect upon my petition and take pity on my sincere heart.\n\nShould the August Ones above deign to proclaim this, may the Heavenly Perfected of the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts, the Numinous Treasure and Primordial Beginning Great Spirits, deliver my nine generations of ancestors to ascend into the Southern Palace. May their withered bones be crowned and girdled, their decayed frames restored to bloom, and their exhausted souls, revolving in suffering, be transformed to enter the gates of immortality. May the spirits already ascended advance in rank within the immortal palaces, their names inscribed in jade, recorded in the golden registers and treasure repositories of the Nine Heavens’ immortal records.\n\nI entreat the Azure Tooth Azure Thearch of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, the Azure Waist Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Eastern Precinct, along with the Azure Dragon troops and generals of the Jia-Yi offices, numbering nine hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Liver.\n\nI entreat the Vermilion Tooth Three Qi Heavenly Lord, the Primordial Qi Elder, the Vermilion Palace Great Cinnabar Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Southern Precinct, along with the Vermilion Dragon troops and generals of the Bing-Ding offices, numbering three hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Crimson Palace of the Heart.\n\nI entreat the Yellow Thearch of the Primordial Grotto’s Supreme Thearch Mountain, the Supreme Thearch Perfected, the Vermilion Child Yellow Court Earth Granary Jade Maiden, the Central Yellow Supreme Thearch Officials, and the Numinous Officials, along with the Yellow Dragon troops and generals of the Wu-Ji offices, numbering twelve hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Spleen.\n\nI entreat the White Thearch of the Seven Qi Heaven, the Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master, the Supreme White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Western Precinct, along with the White Dragon troops and generals of the Geng-Xin offices, numbering seven hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Lungs.\n\nI entreat the Black Thearch of the Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, the Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord, the Supreme Numinous Lord, the Night Radiance Jade Maiden, and the Numinous Officials of the Northern Precinct, along with the Black Dragon troops and generals of the Ren-Gui offices, numbering five hundred million each, to descend as one into the disciple’s body and guard the Palace of the Kidneys.",

A circular image appears upon the neck, illuminating the ten directions. They roam the world, greeted by the officials of the Three Realms, the celestial and terrestrial deities of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, who bow in attendance and escort them. The myriad spirits guard the Perfected, summoning clouds and descending rain, commanding the Eight Might to summon dragons, performing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, instantly responding to the natural order.\n\nWhen the great kalpas cycle and vast calamities surge from the four directions, the body attains flight and traverses heavenly disasters. Amid the Eight Difficulties and a thousand perils with ten thousand poisons, all are dissolved and extinguished. Demons are vanquished and trials repelled, malevolent spirits slain and treachery severed. They perceive the hidden and the manifest, discern fortune and misfortune in reverse, and command the celestial officials. Sitting, they summon the divine immortals of the ten directions to arrive spontaneously, transforming their radiance and refining their form, sitting or standing at will, vanishing or appearing. They ascend to the Upper Clarity, accompanying their nine generations of ancestors to ascend the Nine Heavens together.\n\nAfter the disciple receives the Perfection, they close their mouth and cultivate in secrecy, awaiting the celestial Perfected. Fathers do not instruct sons; it resides solely within the self. After seven years and within forty years, if one encounters a person of immortal attainment, they shall report to the Nine Heavens for transmission, where the Four Controllers, Five Thearchs, and Three Officials will summon and examine the disciple’s nine generations of ancestors, overseeing the covenant and scrutinizing their conduct and adherence to the precepts, ensuring no violation of the celestial numina. In life and death, they shall attain immortality together.\n\nShould they transgress the celestial statutes, divulging the Perfected Texts midway, the living and deceased parents, along with the disciple’s own body, shall confess their sins before the Four Luminaries, enduring the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas and the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never daring to seek pardon. Before the disciple fully participates in the Great Rites, their thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins are beseeched for absolution. From this day forth, they renew their vows and present their petition, which ascends to be memorialized before the Supreme, the Cavernous Mystery, the Numinous Treasure, the Primordial Jade August, and the Five Elder Thearchs.\n\nMay they deign to bestow their luminous regard and universally inform the myriad spirits, all wishing the disciple’s name to endure as a Perfected One, illumined by the Three Luminaries and eternally abiding with the Five Qi. We implore the August and Venerable Supreme Dao of the Utmost Perfection of the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Perfected, to discern and compassionately attend to this plea.\n\nYour servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates in submission, kowtowing repeatedly to memorialize this entreaty. Your servant, of the surname [X] from the prefecture and county of [Y],\n\nTo the Supreme, Primordial, August, and Venerable Supreme Dao; the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure; the Five Elder Jade August Thearchs; and the Great Sage, Jade August Sovereign.\n\nIn the year [Z], the month [A], and the day [B], presented at the Golden Dragon Post of [C] Mountain Peak in the prefecture and county of [D].\n\nThe ancient statutes of the Mysterious Capital confer the rites of the Upper Perfected, inscribed in vermilion upon yellow silk. When transmitting the scriptures and rites upon the numinous marchmounts, the texts are exposed for three days and three nights, undisturbed by wind or drifting, thereby deemed suitable for the Perfected. If encountered by wind, transmission is withheld. Should the texts be exposed to wind thrice, causing the memorial to flutter, such a person is deemed unsuitable, and transmission must not proceed. These celestial statutes are severe; master and disciple must together deliberate and exercise utmost caution, ensuring alignment with the celestial numina.\n\nHere ends the Lower Scroll of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Vermilion Writ and Jade Instructions of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure of the Supreme*.",
