  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Xuan Gang Lun* Presented to the Emperor**\n\nYour servant, the Daoist Wu Jun, respectfully submits: I have heard that the Dao relies on emptiness to achieve union, and principles depend on words to be made manifest. When I formerly dwelled in mountain caves, I composed writings on the practice of cultivation. I humbly consider that the Profound Mystery is deep and difficult to trace to its depths, while the Three Caverns are recondite and rarely does one glimpse their gate. This leaves those who turn toward the wind adrift and without foundation. Thus, I have gathered the essentials and called them the *Xuan Gang*. I hope that by following the current, one may return to the source, and that by expounding the subtle, its purport will not be lost. As for the signs of solitary transformation in the highest emptiness or the means by which the loftiest adepts ascend as immortals—matters unaddressed by former sages or omitted in the true scriptures—I have ventured to set forth my humble thoughts and arranged them in these chapters.\n\nI reverently consider that Your Majesty, the Sagely, Civil, Divine, and Martial Emperor Who Proves the Dao and Embodies Filial Virtue, is the sovereign of the Supreme Dao, who magnifies the teachings of spontaneity. All things flourish under the potter’s wheel of your governance, and the black-haired people are at peace within the realm of benevolence and longevity. How could a speck of dust add to the towering mountain, or a spark of fire aid the sun? Yet though this offering is slight, Your Sagely Luminance does not reject it. I dare to present these meager words, hoping they may catch a ray of celestial light. The old writings I have composed are respectfully submitted with this memorial. To trouble Your August Attention with such trifles fills me with trembling awe.\n\nYour servant Wu Jun, with utmost reverence and fear, bows his head again and again.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\nOn the eleventh day of the sixth month in the thirteenth year of the Tianbao era,\nYour servant Wu Jun, a Daoist of the Zhongyue Songyang Abbey, presents this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**The *Xuan Gang Lun* of Master Zongxuan**\n\n**First Scroll: Clarifying the Dao and Its Virtue (Nine Chapters)**\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nWhat is the Dao?\nIt is the lineage of emptiness and nothingness, the root of creation and transformation, the foundation of spirit and illumination, the source of heaven and earth. Vast beyond all bounds, subtle beyond all interiors, boundless and without limit, darkly obscure and without counterpart—so profoundly hidden it cannot be perceived, yet its great brilliance sheds light; so utterly still it has no mind, yet the ten thousand things attain their proper forms. Formless and indistinct, soundless and silent, the myriad images arise from it, and the five notes are completed through it. That which is born has its end, and that which is completed must decline. Birth after birth, completion after completion—this has never changed from ancient times to the present. This is called the Dao.\n\nWhat is virtue?\nIt is what heaven and earth receive, what yin and yang rely upon. It is ordered by the five phases and woven by the four seasons. Governed by the ruler, instructed by the teacher, the hidden and the manifest, the moving and the still—all flourish in accord with what is fitting. Its blessings flow without end, yet grasses grow without knowing to thank its merit. Its kindness extends without limit, yet the hundred clans do not know to rely on its power. This is called virtue.\n\nThus, that which pervades and gives life is called the Dao, and the Dao is fundamentally nameless. That which nurtures and brings to completion is called virtue, and virtue is fundamentally unnameable. Let us consider: heaven and earth, humans and things, spirits and immortals, ghosts and gods—without the Dao, none could be born; without virtue, none could be completed. That which is born does not know its beginning; that which is completed does not see its end. Though one delves into mysteries and seeks out subtleties, none can fathom its origin. It enters the end of being and emerges before non-being. None can exhaust its traces—it is called the spontaneous.\n\nThe spontaneous is the constant of the Dao and virtue, the warp of heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Two: Primordial Qi**\n\nBefore the great emptiness, what was there in the silence and desolation?\nThe purest essence stirred and responded, and the True One arose.\nThe True One moved with spirit, and primordial qi transformed of itself.\nPrimordial qi is being within non-being, non-being within being—boundless and immeasurable, subtle and imperceptible. Vaporous and gradually manifesting, indistinct and without boundary, it is the origin of the ten thousand images, the first sign of their emergence.\n\nThereupon, the clear, penetrating, and limpid qi floated upward to become heaven; the turbid, stagnant, and murky qi congealed below to become earth. The harmonious, gentle, and compliant qi coalesced to form human relationships; the errant, perverse, and harsh qi dispersed to become miscellaneous kinds. From the nurturing of this single qi, the ten thousand differences spread and species divided. Once they enter the mechanism of transformation, their changes are endless.\n\nThus, it is primordial qi that gives form to heaven, earth, humans, and things. It is spirit and illumination that bestow numinosity upon them. Therefore, Qian and Kun govern heaven and earth, while essence and soul direct humans and things. Qi undergoes the revolutions of yin and yang, but spirit knows no changes of cold or heat. Though its movements are manifold and its transformations innumerable, it perishes and revives again, ends and begins anew. The body of the Dao, the mind of spirit and illumination—responding and perceiving without exhaustion, they are never wearied in the realm of activity and function.\n\n**Chapter Three: True Essence**\n\nHeaven and earth cannot exist of themselves; that which possesses heaven and earth is the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Supreme Ultimate cannot move of itself; that which moves the Supreme Ultimate is true essence.\nTrue essence is spontaneous—only spirit, only illumination. The August One is called the August Sovereign of Emptiness, who dwells high in the Ninefold Clarity. He oversees the mysterious transformations and governs the ten thousand spirits. Through him, Qian moves and Kun is at peace. Silent and inactive, he brings about the completion of the myriad grasses. Before the empty and cavernous, in the utmost emptiness beyond measure, the primordial harmony is limpid and upright.\n\nFrom this, the numinous and true transform in solitude. Not only the countless multitudes, but even those who look up to the Most Exalted—all have their offices. They wander and rest in cinnabar terraces and jade groves, drink cloud-juice and feast on rosy provisions. Their movement is not of the mind; their soaring is not of wings. They do not listen with ears, yet hear without limit. They do not see with eyes, yet perceive without end.\n\nThese all have no ancestor, no lineage, no beginning, no end. They embrace harmony and cherish compassion, pitying the benighted and mourning the deluded. Though their bodies differ in purity and turbidity, the true and the vulgar share no common ground.\n\nThey descend with qi and divide their radiance, thus born among men. Wise and enlightened, broadly accomplished, they take universal relief as their work. As rulers and leaders, they enable all things to flow freely. Passing through the ages, their mysterious merit is truly fulfilled. Their virtue transforms heaven and earth, their names inscribed in the imperial archives.\n\nThereupon, when the movement ceases in the Northern Capital, the mandate is marked in the Southern Palace. The primordial true descends, becoming the master of form. Once yin qi has fallen, the world’s dust is naturally obstructed. Refining the embryo and altering the substance, they cast off filth and remove decay. Spirit and form unite in harmony, and in broad daylight, they ascend lightly.\n\nThis is what is called returning to my homeland, returning to my constancy, and being boundless with the Dao—who then knows its method?\n\n**Heavenly Endowment, Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is fundamentally without movement or stillness, yet yin and yang arise from it. Qi is fundamentally without purity or turbidity, yet heaven and earth take shape from it. Pure yang blazes brightly above, for above the Nine Heavens there is no yin. Pure yin lies darkly below, for below the Nine Earths there is no yang. Yin and yang intermingle and steam forth, giving birth to the ten thousand existences. That which gives birth to the ten thousand existences resides precisely between heaven and earth.\n\nThus, the configurations of qi transform and shift, darkness and light take form. Yang, through clarity, is upright, and its essence becomes true numen. Yin, through obscurity, is perverse, and its essence becomes demonic specters. Therefore, those born endowed with yang numen are wise and sagacious, while those nurtured by yin specters are stubborn and fierce. The wise and sagacious are kind and harmonious, for yang delights in giving life. The stubborn and fierce are perverse and violent, for yin delights in killing.\n\nSome are good, some are not—these two qi combine equally to produce the mediocre. Each of the three receives its endowment differently, so where should teaching be applied? Teaching is applied for the mediocre alone. Why? The wise and sagacious know without being taught, while the stubborn and fierce, though taught, do not change. These all receive the pure qi of yin and yang. It is like fire, which can be extinguished but cannot be made cold, or ice, which can melt but cannot be made hot. Such is the inherent principle.\n\nWhen the mediocre do good, harmonious qi responds; when they do evil, harmful qi gathers. Thus, accumulating good brings surplus blessings, while accumulating evil brings surplus misfortune. With blessings and misfortunes, teaching is thereby established.\n\n**Nature and Emotion, Chapter Five**\nThat which gives me life is the Dao; that which endows me is spirit. Yet longevity or early death, departure or abiding—these do not depend on oneself. Why? Because nature moves and becomes emotion, and emotion turns against the Dao. Thus, one is moved by the mechanism of transformation and cannot maintain oneself.\n\nTo transcend the realm of existence and nonexistence, to lodge the heart in the realm of self-attainment—why should it be so? The Dao can be one’s teacher, and spirit can be one’s friend. How is this so? The Dao and spirit act without striving, and qi transforms of itself; they deliberate without thought, and things complete themselves. They enter into the ranks of the myriad kinds and emerge beyond the bounds of life and death.\n\nTherefore, the noble person rejects desires, quiets brilliance, sees without color, hears without sound. Serene and pure, embodying harmony and spirit clarity, empty and at ease, forgetting the self—only then do they unite with the utmost essence. This is what is called returning to my origin, reverting to unity with the Dao. United with the Dao, then the workings of creation cannot alter them, ghosts and spirits cannot know them—how much less can men?\n\n**Transcending Movement and Stillness, Chapter Six**\nThe Dao is utterly without form, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth. Heaven moves, yet the Northern Asterism does not shift, and the qi it contains does not diminish. Earth is still, yet the eastern flow does not cease, and the arising of clouds does not exhaust. Thus, stillness is the heart of heaven and earth, and movement is the qi of heaven and earth. The heart is still, and qi moves—this is how they cover and bear without limit.\n\nTherefore, those who penetrate the Dao, though they soar beyond the cosmos, their hearts remain ever tranquil. Though they rest within the finest hair’s breadth, their qi moves of itself. Thus, if the heart is not tranquil, there is no way to unite with the Dao; if qi does not move, there is no way to preserve form. When form is preserved and the Dao is united, this is the virtue of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, one who moves yet does not know they move has transcended movement. One who is still yet does not know they are still has gone beyond stillness. Therefore, one who has transcended movement cannot be pushed by yang. One who has gone beyond stillness cannot be shifted by yin. Yin and yang cannot alter them—how much less can the ten thousand things?\n\nThus, one who is not enticed by things is called utmost stillness. Only after utmost stillness can one unite with utmost emptiness. When emptiness reaches its limit, there is clarity; when clarity reaches its limit, there is luminosity; when luminosity reaches its limit, there is penetration. The penetrating one, though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things abundant, cannot escape the mirror of the square inch.\n\n**Uniting Being and Nonbeing, Chapter Seven**\nThe Dao encompasses countless numbers yet is not great; it penetrates the tip of an autumn hair yet is not small. It precedes emptiness and nothingness yet is not a beginning; it follows heaven and earth yet is not an end. It ascends and accumulates yang yet is not bright; it sinks into heavy yin yet is not dark.\n\nOriginally without spirit, when emptiness reaches its limit, spirit arises of itself. Originally without qi, when spirit moves, qi transforms of itself. Qi is originally without substance; when it congeals and accumulates, it forms shape. Shape is originally without emotion; when it is put to use, it harms nature. Once shape is formed and nature moves, one drifts ever farther from the Dao.\n\nThus, one is submerged in life and death, shifted by yin and yang, unable to maintain oneself—not because the Dao exists and then perishes. Therefore, if the Dao can generate being from nonbeing, how could it not make being unite with nonbeing? If being unites with nonbeing, then being does not perish.\n\nThus, that which gives me life is the Dao; that which destroys me is emotion. If one forgets emotion, then nature is preserved whole. When nature is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, qi is whole; when qi is whole, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the Dao is whole. When the Dao is whole, spirit is sovereign; when spirit is sovereign, qi is numinous; when qi is numinous, form transcends; when form transcends, nature is penetrating; when nature is penetrating, it circulates and flows back, uniting with the Dao as one.\n\nOne can make being into nonbeing, make emptiness into fullness. I shall be a companion to the creator—how can life and death burden me?\n\n**Chapter Eight: Transforming the Customs of the Age**\n\nThe Dao and its virtue are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Emperors and kings are the lords of the Three Powers. Thus, the Dao and its virtue, Heaven and Earth, and emperors and kings are one. Yet why do they differ in ancient and modern times, in simplicity and decadence, in the order of Yao and the chaos of Jie?\n\nThe Dao and its virtue know no rise or decline; human relations know prosperity and adversity. Past and present do not change; only nature and emotion shift. Thus, when the era is about to prosper, the utmost yang and true essence descend to become its ruler, the worthy assist while the wicked submit. When the era is about to decline, the great yin and pure essence ascend to become its lord, the wicked aid while the worthy withdraw. The Dao of Heaven and Earth follows the reckoning of yin and yang, hence the divergence between order and chaos.\n\nThat the ancients were simple while the moderns are decadent is like a person being foolish in youth and wise in maturity. Before an infant can speak, it embodies the pristine purity of high antiquity. As it begins to discern, it upholds the benevolence and righteousness of the middle age. When it reaches the age for learning, it reveres the rites and wisdom of the later age. In adulthood, with many desires, it competes in vanity and falsehood, like the degenerate era. Such is the principle of transformation and the suitability of customs, hence the difference between simplicity and decadence.\n\nTracing the cause and source, one’s nature shifts through study, and people scatter their original simplicity by following the times. Nevertheless, a father must teach his son, and a ruler must govern his people. Teaching a son lies in proper conduct; governing people lies in the Dao and its virtue. If proper conduct is lost, teachers and friends cannot instruct; if the Dao and its virtue are forsaken, rites and music cannot be ordered. Even with punishments and floggings, it is difficult to restrain treacherous ministers and rebellious sons.\n\nThus, instructing the young with no deceit preserves loyalty and trust. Transforming the customs of the age with purity and simplicity brings harmony with Heaven’s peace. Therefore, those who do not grasp the Dao and its virtue to govern people have never attained the ultimate principle.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Clarifying Root and Branch**\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, rites, and wisdom are the great principles of imperial governance. Yet why does the Daoist school alone speak of abandoning benevolence and righteousness and belittling rites and wisdom?\n\nThe Dao values what is fundamental. Thus, utmost benevolence aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth; utmost righteousness aligns with their suitability; utmost rites align with their form; utmost wisdom aligns with their discernment. All are naturally endowed, not something that can be attained through mere admiration. To forcefully imitate them is to become false. When falsehood arises, myriad deceptions sprout, and laws cannot govern them.\n\nThus, the ancients prized simplicity and despised decadence, valued the Dao and its virtue internally while placing benevolence and righteousness externally, prioritized plainness and simplicity over rites and wisdom—to strengthen the root and secure the branch. Like deep roots yielding flourishing branches, a deep source yielding a long flow, this is not to abandon benevolence and righteousness or belittle rites and wisdom.\n\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue remains; when virtue declines, benevolence remains; when benevolence wanes, righteousness remains; when righteousness is lacking, rites remain. When rites collapse, chaos follows, and wisdom becomes sufficient to dominate the world. Thus, rites and wisdom are the great barriers against chaos, while the Dao and its virtue are the grand principles for governing it.\n\nTherefore, the Dao and its virtue are the root of rites, while rites and wisdom are the branch of the Dao. Grasping the root is easy and secure; holding the branch is difficult and perilous. Thus, if a ruler takes the Dao as his heart, virtue as his body, benevolence and righteousness as his chariot and robes, and rites and wisdom as his crown and cap, he may govern with folded arms and transform the world. If he exalts rites and wisdom while forgetting the Dao and its virtue, his actions will have outward adornment but no inner spirit. Though he toils day and night, the world will fall into decay.\n\nThus, the Three Sovereigns transformed the world with the Dao; the Five Emperors governed it with virtue; the Three Kings ordered it with benevolence and righteousness; the Five Hegemons led it with rites and wisdom. The Three Sovereigns achieved perfect governance; the Five Hegemons nearly brought chaos. Therefore, abandoning the Dao and its virtue to rely solely on rites and wisdom is not the way of ruling. Only by first clarifying the Dao and its virtue can rites and wisdom be properly esteemed.\n\nLaozi said: \"Rites are the decline of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos. Govern with wisdom, and it becomes the state’s bane; govern without wisdom, and it becomes the state’s blessing.\" This means that when rites are lacking, chaos arises; when wisdom changes, deceit follows. Thus, one must block the source of chaos and sever the root of deceit.\n\nYet scholars like Yang Xiong and Ban Gu all claim that Daoists belittle benevolence and righteousness, disparage rites and wisdom, and rely solely on emptiness and tranquility—this is because worldly Confucians do not grasp the profound intent of the mysterious sages.\n\n**Middle Section: Discourses on Methods and Teachings (Fifteen Chapters in Total)**\n\n**Chapter Ten: Establishing Teachings Through the Divine Dao**\n\nAt the inception of the Nine Mysteries, the Two Images had not yet taken form. A numinous wind gathered in subtlety, and emptiness congealed into splendor. Precious scriptures coalesced in primordial unity; jade characters marked solitary transformation. Emerging between being and nonbeing, radiant before the dark and yellow, the sun and moon drew from it to illuminate, Heaven and Earth relied on it to cover and support.\n\nThen, the Supreme Void Sovereign commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to inscribe it on golden tablets and arrange it in jade chapters. Initially hidden in the highest mystery, its influence later flowed down to the earth. Descending to observe the worthy, it bestowed this text. Thus, Fuxi received the Diagram, Xuanyuan received the Talisman, Gaoxin received the Heavenly Classic, and Great Yu received the Luo River Writing—here began the establishment of teachings through the divine Dao.\n\nLater, the Mysterious Origin sought to transform customs, serving as imperial teacher through the ages. When human relations grew decadent, it set forth the Dao and its virtue to restore simplicity. When ghosts and spirits caused disturbances, it expounded the Alliance of Might to dispel evil. Extending to Su, Mao, the Zhou kings, Pei, Wei, Yang, and Xu, none failed to personally receive the mysterious sages and transmit the precious scriptures. Thus, the Western Terrace did not conceal its numinous texts, nor did the Eastern Flower withhold its true instructions. Hence, dragon scripts and cloud seals gradually descended to humanity, with masters and disciples passing them down, and the scriptures and methods ever expanding.\n\nYet while they may be surveyed in full, it is difficult to practice them entirely. Why? Because one person’s heart, burdened with the Dao of many sages, grows weary in spirit and exhausted in form, unable to fathom their subtleties.\n\nThus, by comprehensive study to dispel doubt and by focused practice to attain subtlety, one neither neglects cultivation nor abandons tranquility and harmony. The Dao resides in utmost refinement, not in the pursuit of breadth alone.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Learning Proceeds in Order**\nThough the Dao has no fixed form, learning proceeds in order. Therefore, one begins with *Zhengyi*, advances to *Dongshen*, abides in *Lingbao*, and rests in *Dongzhen*. All take utmost stillness as their foundation, concentrated thought as their function, fasting and purification as their duty, and compassion and kindness as their priority. Without utmost stillness, the spirit does not congeal; without concentrated thought, resonance is not thorough; without fasting and purification, the true does not respond; without compassion and kindness, merit is not achieved. When the spirit congeals, resonance is thorough, the true responds, and merit is accomplished, this is called the first step of the immortal’s ascent. Thereafter, one refines the viscera through exhalation and inhalation, harmonizes the body through guiding and stretching, cherishes the spirit through treasuring the scriptures, and nourishes the bones with jade-like nectar—all in accordance with the master’s instructions, delving into the profound mysteries of the true. Then, qi and fluids flow unimpeded, form and spirit unite as one, and without need of golden elixirs or jade fungi, one may await cloud-plowing and feathered canopies. If one regards mere breath control as subtlety, bending and stretching as essential, medicinal tonics as the task, and miscellaneous arts as profit, this is to know how to nourish the form but not how to treasure the spirit. Those who do not treasure the spirit, though they may live as long as tortoises or cranes, will never attain the hope of immortality.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: When Yang Prevails, One Becomes an Immortal**\nYang and yin coexist, and thus humans are born. The hun is the yang spirit, the po is the yin numen. They intertwine to form the embryo, circulate qi, nurture the body, and construct the form. Yet their power is never complete; if complete, each returns to its origin. Thus, when yin prevails, yang is exhausted and one dies; when yang prevails, yin is dissolved and one becomes an immortal. Gentleness, kindness, integrity, and purity are yang. Harshness, malice, jealousy, and impurity are yin. When the heart is serene and empty, yang harmony pervades the mind; when restless and desirous, yin qi enters the light. These two are controlled by oneself. When yang prevails and yin is subdued, this is the beginning of longevity. This beginning is the first step of the immortal’s path, the threshold of undying.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Emptiness and Clarity Merge with the Origin**\nThe Dao does not desire a heart set on anything; with such a heart, true qi does not gather. Yet it also does not desire forced forgetfulness; if the heart is forcibly forgotten, external evils take residence. It lies in equanimity and tranquility, clarity and subtlety, emptiness and clarity merging with the origin, responding unfailingly to all stimuli. Respond but do not cling, and truth and falsehood become distinct. If my heart does not incline, nothing is not upright. If thoughts are attached to anything, nothing is not perverse. The coming of perversity or uprightness lies within myself. Though one may esteem emptiness, oblivion, and the abandonment of form and thought, without profound resonance and far-reaching clarity, one cannot penetrate the mysterious and attain the true. Thus, advanced learners who rest in contemplation are overcome by the yin corpse’s qi; those who listen to diligent zeal are dominated by the yang harmony’s spirit. Those who alternate between rest and diligence are still in the midst of battle. The key lies in disciplining the self, rousing one’s conduct, and resolutely opposing laxity and indolence, ensuring that concentration remains unbroken. Those who persevere in this will see the corpse dissolve and the spirit reign. When the spirit reigns, this is called yang prevailing. When yang prevails, the Dao is near.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Refining Yin with Yang**\nYang is fire, yin is water. Ice and charcoal cannot share the same vessel; victory and defeat each have their destination. The Daoist and the commoner reverse their natures, and each refines differently. The multitude refines yang with yin, while the Daoist refines yin with yang. Refining yang with yin leads from strength to old age, from old age to decline, from decline to senility, from senility to illness, and from illness to death. Refining yin with yang leads from old age back to infancy, from turbidity back to clarity, from decline back to vigor, from coarseness back to refinement, from illness back to harmony, and from premature death back to longevity, gradually aligning with the true Dao to attain immortality. Thus, if even a trace of yang remains unextinguished, one does not reach death. If even a fraction of yin remains unvanquished, one does not attain immortality. Immortals transcend utmost yang to unite with the true; the dead sink into great yin to become ghosts. This is called each following its kind. Therefore, embracing primordial harmony, holding to pure unity, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, guiding and stretching, concentrating the mind in stillness, and maintaining effortless detachment—all aim to refine yin stagnation with yang numinosity, making inner and outer empty and bright, thoroughly merging with the utmost true. Those who persevere in this—is immortality far away?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: When the Form Moves, the Heart is Still**\nWhen the form moves yet the heart is still, the spirit congeals while the traces shift—this is non-action. When dwelling in leisure yet the spirit is disturbed, or when outwardly reverent yet the heart wanders—this is action. Non-action brings order; action brings chaos. Though non-action is supremely easy, only the utmost enlightened can attain it. Heaven and earth are non-active by day and by night; their non-action is one, yet order and chaos differ. Why? By day, non-action is bright, so the multitude of yang appears while the yin of plants lies hidden. By night, non-action is dark, so the yin of plants moves while the multitude of yang rests. Thus, when the ruler is enlightened and non-active, the loyal and good advance while the treacherous and flattering withdraw, and the world is well-governed. When the ruler is benighted and non-active, the loyal and good retreat while the treacherous and flattering take office, and the world falls into chaos. Therefore, the enlightened practice non-action with wisdom, while the benighted practice non-action in confusion. Wisdom leads to communion with the Dao; confusion leads to conformity with things. Though both the Dao and things are non-active, how can they be the same? Thus, though the perfected value non-action, they cannot fail to discern. Only those who discern and yet remain non-active can truly be called non-active.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: When the Spirit is Clear and the Mind is Calm**\nAdvanced learners at times feel elation and distant aspirations, delighting in the realm of self-attainment, believing that true immortals may be encountered and the celestial vaults ascended—this is the spirit reigning. Though the spirit may reign, one must still guard against the dissipation of yang harmony’s qi and the encroachment of yin evil’s qi.\n\nOne may enter a quiet chamber to pacify the mind, restraining whatever arises. In stillness and silence, with single-minded focus, the spirit remains undispersed, and the yang numen remains whole. Take care not to indulge in the emotions of joy and ease, lest yin evil’s qi arrive. As the ancients said: when joy departs, sorrow comes; when yang wanes, yin prevails.\n\nShould there be moments of restlessness, agitation, or vexation, this is because the various po within the form are being refined by the yang numen’s qi, and the accumulated stagnation of the yin corpse is about to disperse—thus disturbing the true within the Crimson Palace. One may enter the chamber to settle the thoughts, preserve the One and clench the fists, expel the turbid dregs, and await the spirit’s clarity and qi’s calm. Then, reflecting on one’s errors and repenting, one must strive for self-renewal. Thus turning to align with the path of emptiness and stillness, this is also one of the arts of cleansing the mind.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Conduct Pure, Heart Steadfast**\nConduct should be pure, the heart steadfast. Let speech not exceed conduct, and conduct not betray the heart—then one roams the crossroads of the four directions. The crossroads of the four directions are the thoroughfares of traversing the Dao. In ceaseless conduct, heaven and earth cherish one, the numinous powers protect one; misfortune and violence cannot befall, and ghosts and spirits cannot disturb.\n\nIf speech is pure yet conduct is turbid, the name immaculate yet the traces defiled—though shame is concealed outwardly, the heart is deluded inwardly. When the heart is deluded inwardly, heaven and earth detest one, the numinous powers pursue one. Though one may exert great effort in the Dao, attainment is impossible. Thus, it is better to endure others’ slander than to incur heaven’s censure. Human slander may be dispelled, but heaven’s censure cannot be evaded.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The True Person as Companion**\nWhat the Dao most abhors is harm, killing, yin treachery—these are indeed easy to guard against. As for minor likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals, the common emotions of people, these are most difficult to be cautious of. One should not allow even the slightest matter to disturb the square inch of the heart. When thoughts are still and the spirit at ease, evil qi cannot enter. When one’s will is undisturbed, the true person becomes one’s companion.\n\nMoreover, those who love praise and hate slander are not the way of the worthy and enlightened. Yet if one examines oneself and finds no goodness yet receives praise, it is inauspicious. If one reflects and finds no fault yet is slandered, what harm is there? In this discussion, gain and loss lie within oneself, not elsewhere. Thus, those who remain serene, \"forgetting emotions,\" unmoved by beauty or ugliness in their hearts—these are the perfected, the perfected indeed.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Benevolence, Clarity, Steadfastness, and Stillness**\nThose who are benevolent, clear, steadfast, and still—broadly accomplished and brilliantly outstanding—are all those in whom the qi of heaven and humanity is divided, descending to be born to aid the times and benefit things. When their accumulated merit is complete across generations, their names are recorded in the Cinnabar Terrace. The primordial and steadfast flow in the Supreme Mystery; the upright qi densely gathers in the Pass Palace. Naturally, the po are refined and the corpse extinguished, the spirit congeals and the body becomes pure. When the yin dregs are entirely dissolved, one merges with the form and ascends lightly.\n\nThus, the immortals of old were never anything but heaven-born humans. To make the walking corpse share their inclinations—is this not difficult? Some accumulate cultivation and layered practice yet do not attain ascension—why? Their prior merit has not yet manifested. Some do not rely on cultivation yet spontaneously attain immortality—why? Their past conduct was fully sufficient.\n\nMerit is not built in vain; goodness is not bestowed without cause. If one sees others attaining without effort, yet oneself does not, then one must reflect on one’s own life and breath. To witness spontaneous feathered transformation and claim that merit does not depend on human effort—this is far from the truth.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Establishing Merit, Correcting Errors**\nMerit should be concealed; errors should be exposed. Concealed merit can be preserved; exposed errors can be eradicated. If merit is not preserved and errors are not eradicated, how can one’s name be recorded in the immortal registers, and long life be hoped for?\n\nYet merit need not be great—meeting things, one rescues them. Errors need not be small—recognizing wrongdoing, one becomes wise. One need not rush to establish merit or hasten to correct errors. If errors are corrected and not repeated, and merit is established without wearying halfway, this is called daily renewing one’s virtue, and heaven will protect one. For such as these, why must one wait for the eight solar terms or the three primal days to speak of merit and repent errors? The numinous and true are ever watchful—this is their constant way.\n\nMoreover, in repenting errors and praying with reflection, one must be sincere and earnest, directing one’s sincere will and focused heart toward the Three Clarities, as if standing before the Golden Portals. There is no need to prostrate the body or recite words of supplication. If one merely adds bowing, kneeling, knocking the head, and reciting ordinary texts, this may be called displaying minor goodness to others, but it is truly not the grand rule of moving and inspiring.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Restraining Evil, Cultivating Good**\nThe essence of yang is called the hun and the spirit; the essence of yin is called the corpse and the po. When the spirit prevails, one does good; when the corpse is strong, one does evil. Restraining evil and cultivating good is order; forgetting good and indulging evil is chaos. With order prolonged, the corpse is extinguished and the po refined. With chaos prolonged, the spirit departs and the hun dissolves.\n\nThus, when the corpse is extinguished and the po refined, the spirit and form merge to become an immortal. When the spirit departs and the hun dissolves, the corpse and po unite to become a ghost. This is the natural Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Emptying the Will to Whiteness**\nThe spirit and hun favor purity; the corpse and po favor filth. One should always empty the will to whiteness and bathe the form in snow, so that the spirit and hun delight in well-being, and the corpse and po are refined and extinguished. When the spirit is at peace and the corpse is extinguished, one becomes daily clearer and fresher. Though one may not yet ascend lightly, I must call this an immortal.\n\nMoreover, sorrow, grief, and suffering are companions of yin. Joy, pleasure, and ease are companions of yang. Thus, when the heart is sorrowful, yin gathers; when the will is joyful, yang disperses. Neither sorrowful nor joyful, serene and non-active—this is called primordial harmony. Without primordial harmony, one cannot attain the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Entrusting the Heart to Spontaneity**\nThe eyes delight in seductive beauty as splendor; the heart values fame and reputation. The body favors light and fine adornments; the mouth craves rare and exquisite flavors. The ears enjoy wondrous and beautiful sounds; the nose delights in fragrant and sweet scents. These six all corrupt virtue and harm nature, and are called the axes that fell the numinous root.\n\nThus, if one possesses them, one may distance oneself; if one lacks them, there is no need to seek them. Only clothing and food are essential to people—yet even these are one of the pitfalls for those who pursue the Dao.\n\nYet when one entrusts the heart to spontaneity, there is never a lack of what one needs. Even as Heaven and Earth bring forth birds and beasts, they still cover them with feathers and provide them with insects and grains—how much more so for humans? One must forget one’s pursuits and allow things to follow their natural course.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Emptying, Concentrating, Stillness, and Breath**\nWaking unites with yang; sleep merges with yin. Excessive waking strengthens the hun-soul; prolonged sleep fortifies the po-soul. A strong hun-soul belongs to the living; a robust po-soul belongs to the dead. If one feasts on primordial harmony, purges rich flavors, and thereby clarifies the spirit and refreshes the qi, attaining wakefulness day and night—only in empty concentration and still breath is there nothing greater.\n\n**Nine Chapters on Resolving Obstructions: Lower Section**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Meeting Heavenly Principle**\nSomeone asked: \"When the human heart is left to its own devices for long, it becomes vast and forgets to return; when suddenly reined in, it leaps beyond all bounds. Letting it roam harms our nature; restraining it exhausts our spirit. What method can one who seeks the Dao use to attain stillness?\"\n\nI replied: \"Nature is originally most concentrated, moved only by external stimuli. Once stirred, the habit of movement grows over time—how can it suddenly become tranquil? Having grown accustomed to movement and drifted far, one may grow accustomed to stillness and become serene. Thus, those who cultivate stillness well achieve tranquility with ease; those who do so poorly become troubled without result. Therefore, when agitation arises, restrain it with calm; when deviance arises, guard it with integrity; when seeking arises, suppress it with relinquishment; when isolation arises, clarify it with purity. Leisurely and at ease, neither desiring nor scheming—then take the mysterious and empty as your domain, the indifferent and remote as your city gates, the Great Harmony as your palace, and silent illumination as your sun and moon. Be only precise and subtle, neither neglecting nor overstepping. Act thus, rest thus, be hasty thus, be carefree thus. One who practices this for long will find things darkening outside while the spirit mirrors within. Without seeking stillness, one becomes still; without pursuing peace, one becomes ever more peaceful. Then movement and stillness are both forgotten, and Heavenly Principle naturally converges. Thus, treading on frost is the beginning of solid ice; cultivating stillness is the step to attaining the Dao. Did the ancients not say, 'Accumulated habits become constant'? This is what they meant.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Revering the Spirit-Way**\nSomeone asked: \"Humans have good and evil—do Heaven, Earth, and the spirit luminaries all know of them?\"\n\nI replied: \"What words are these? What words are these? The heart is the abode of the spirit numen, where the spirit dwells. If the heart schemes, the spirit knows of it. If the spirit knows, then Heaven, Earth, and the spirit luminaries all know of it. There has never been good or evil not schemed in the heart. Once schemed in the heart, the spirit-way perceives it, leaving no escape even by a hair’s breadth. With no escape even by a hair’s breadth, then the blessing of good and the calamity of excess will not err. Someone asked: 'Why did Yan Hui die young, Ran Qiu suffer illness, the thief Zhi live long, Zhuang Shan grow wealthy, King Mu of Chu become a hegemon, and Tian Dan prosper?' I replied: 'The Way of Heaven is distant; the way of humans is near. The effects of karmic retribution are difficult to measure in speed. Thus, the noble may meet their fate, and the petty may have good fortune—but good and ill fortune intertwine in ways not limited to a single form. Therefore, the classic says: \"The net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide, yet nothing escapes.\" It also says: \"What goes around comes around.\" Thus, the principle of karmic retribution is clear. Why must everything be verified in the present?'\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Following Nature and Concentrating the Spirit**\nSomeone asked: \"The spirit presides over stillness—why then does the heart have desires?\"\n\nI replied: \"The spirit is the most numinous of the formless. The spirit is endowed by the Dao, still and in harmony with nature. Humans perceive through the spirit, moving and in harmony with emotion. Thus, following nature concentrates the spirit; following emotion disturbs it. Prolonged concentration stills the spirit; extreme disturbance scatters it. Stillness gives life; scattering brings death—all shifted by emotion, not commanded by the spirit. Someone asked: 'Then who transforms nature into emotion?' I replied: 'Internally, it is the qi of the yin-corpse that rebels; externally, it is the allure of sounds and sights that seduces. Accumulated habits become vast and unruly, unable to settle—this is not what the spirit desires to move.'\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Dao Reverses Custom**\nSomeone asked: \"What people most love is what Daoists most abhor—why is this?\"\n\nI replied: \"Fortune and longevity are what people desire; misfortune and early death are what they detest. Yet they do not know that what they most love invites misfortune and early death, while desirelessness brings lasting fortune and longevity. In such excessive pursuit, they harm themselves—how deeply deluded they are! Moreover, the seductive beauties of Yan and Zhao are nature’s enemies. The lewd music of Zheng and Wei is the spirit’s foe. Rare delicacies and fine wine cloud the heart. Official robes and caps burden the body. Abandoning these four brings stillness; pursuing them brings disturbance. Forgetting them brings longevity; indulging in them brings early death. Thus, they are what Daoists most abhor.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Focusing Single-Mindedly on the Supreme Dao**\nSomeone asked: \"In ancient times, those who studied immortality were many, yet those who attained the Dao were few—why is this?\"\n\nI replied: \"Among a thousand common people who study the Dao, one understands it. Among a thousand who understand it, one is determined to follow it. Among a thousand determined, one focuses single-mindedly. Among a thousand who focus, one persists long and diligently. Thus, learners are many, but those who succeed are few. If one understands the Dao and can sever worldly ties, and one who severs worldly ties can establish resolve, and one who establishes resolve can focus single-mindedly, and one who focuses can persist long and diligently—there has never been one who studied and did not attain it. Someone asked: 'Then must those who govern the world give up hope of immortality?' I replied: 'Not so. If one is specially endowed with true qi and broadly shelters the living, then governing the world is not an obstacle. But if an ordinary person loves the Dao and yearns to ascend lightly, they must rely on secluded dwelling.'\"\n\nThus, Fuxi inherited from the Qi Mother, the Yellow Emperor ascended through cloud-plowing, Zhuanxu dwelled in the Dark Palace, and Yu the Great roamed the Purple Court—all were those who governed the world yet attained the Dao. As for Laozi serving as the Archivist, Zhuangzi as the Keeper of the Lacquer Garden, Wang Qiao in Huaye County, and Fang Hu ascending the Golden Gate—these too were those who aided their times yet attained the Dao.\n\nMoreover, immortals desire seclusion, and the Dao values namelessness. Some reveal their traces, while others conceal their tracks; they cannot be discerned by a single path nor inferred by a single principle. According to the *True Declarations* and Ge Hong’s *Records of the Primordial Immortals*, since ancient times, those of utmost loyalty, utmost filial piety, utmost sincerity, and utmost integrity—those who have rendered great service to the world—have all attained something, differing from the common stream. Yao, Shun, the Zhou kings, Confucius, Yi Yin, and Lü Shang—all these former sages and worthies were promoted to immortal ranks, which is what is meant by \"those who die yet do not perish live long.\"\n\nMoreover, Baihua, though following the world, feared death and yearned for immortality; after passing, he became a spirit official, his bones undecayed. Once his merits were fulfilled, his spirit and flesh reunited with his remains, his soul returned to his form, and in an instant, he ascended lightly. If even those with but a single virtue do not lose their reward, how much more so for those who devote themselves entirely to the pursuit of immortality?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Preciousness of Long Life**\nSomeone asked: \"Of the great essentials of the Dao, none precede Laozi and Zhuangzi. Yet Laozi and Zhuangzi did not esteem the immortal way—why then do you alone prize immortality?\"\n\nI replied: \"How can you say they did not esteem it? It is said: 'Laozi spoke of \"those who die yet do not perish live long,\"' and again, 'May your descendants’ sacrifices never cease.' Zhuangzi said, 'Who can regard life and death as a single thread?' and again, 'The sage treats the body as an inn.' Are these not proofs?\"\n\nI answered: \"The mysterious sages established their teachings for the common people. Not all who enter the Dao must become immortals. Thus, they first taught them to cultivate their nature. To cultivate one’s nature, one must pacify the heart; when the heart is calm, the spirit harmonizes, and the Dao may be hoped for. Of all things for humans, none is greater than life and death—who can be without feeling? When feeling stirs, nature is diminished, hastening death. If one is content in life and unafraid of death, carefree and at ease, forgetting both sorrow and joy, then feeling is extinguished while nature remains; the form perishes, yet the spirit endures. This is still better than the total loss of both form and nature, hence the saying of equating life and death—this is the utmost. How can you say they did not esteem immortality?\n\n\"The reason humans die is the form; what does not perish is nature. The sages did not esteem the body because it is the dwelling of the spirit and the vessel of nature. What they prized was the spirit and nature. If one fears death and regards the body as real, this is the way of cultivating the self, not the subtlety of cultivating the true. Laozi said: 'Deep roots and firm stems are the way of long life and enduring vision,' and again, 'The valley spirit does not die.' Zhuangzi said: 'After a thousand years, weary of the world, one departs and ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the imperial realm.' Again: 'Thus, I cultivated myself for twelve hundred years, yet my form never once declined.' Again: 'Riding the clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, to roam beyond the four seas.' Again: 'All people die completely, yet I alone endure.' Again: 'When the spirit guards the form, the form attains long life.' Thus, Laozi and Zhuangzi’s words on long life and immortality are clear—how can you say they did not esteem it?\n\n\"Moreover, the *Dao De Jing* and *Nanhua Treatise* largely elucidate the Dao to instruct the world, emphasizing the root to still the branches. The mysteries of immortality are preserved but not discussed. Their esoteric chapters and hidden texts, the wondrous ways of refining the true, are concealed within the Three Caverns and transmitted only to the worthy. Those who lightly disclose them incur the wrath of the celestial officials, while those who revere them have their names recorded in the mysterious registers. Blessings and misfortunes extend to nine generations, and rise and fall affect the individual. How can those who are but walking corpses be allowed to hear and see everything?\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Dao Does Not Abandon Things**\nSomeone asked: \"Things arise from the Dao, and the Dao does not abandon things—why then are those who attain the Dao long-lived, while those who lose it perish?\"\n\nI replied: \"The dragon and the fish both grow in water; light and darkness both arise from the Dao. The dragon summons clouds and dispenses rain, emerging from being and entering non-being. The fish delights among the algae but withers when the spring dries. The dragon grasps the subtlety of water and can transform through it; the fish does not grasp the subtlety of water and cannot transform through it. The superior person dwells in spirit and refines qi, soaring above the celestial vastness. The inferior person harms nature and shortens life, sinking beneath the dark earth. The superior person grasps the subtlety of the Dao and can transform through it; the inferior person does not grasp the subtlety of the Dao and cannot transform through it.\n\n\"Thus, the fish does not know that water gives it life and abandons it—not that water abandons the fish. People do not know that the Dao gives them life and abandon it—not that the Dao abandons people.\"\n\nSomeone said: \"Dragons and fish differ in nature; light and darkness differ in endowment. How can fish transform through water or commoners transform through the Dao?\"\n\nI answered: \"If a fish can dive into deep abysses, hide in secluded caves, and not covet bait, then when it grows large, it will thrash its scales and lash its fins, leaping over Lüliang to become a dragon. If a person can wander Mount Kongtong, rest in tranquility, and sever desires, then when they reach perfection, they will embrace subtlety and契虚, tread the true realm, and become an immortal. The regret is that they conceal themselves insufficiently and guard their spirit inadequately—how could water or the Dao betray the fish or people?\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Discerning Acceptance and Rejection**\nSomeone asked: \"Immortality is the highest beauty for humans, and death is the greatest evil. Yet throughout the ages, gentlemen have known this, yet those who follow the common way are many, while those who practice immortality are few—why is this?\"\n\nSomeone replied: \"There are two reasons for this. First, those whose endowment of qi is not lofty will find their aspirations difficult to broaden. Thus, they drown in immediate affairs, forget far-reaching vision, are muddled by fame and reputation, and obscured by desires. In the end, they remain entangled in the world’s net, never treading the true realm. Second, though some may be endowed with refined qi and a spirit of transcendent excellence, if their merit in aiding others is not yet complete and the path to immortality remains distant, they linger in mortal ranks, unable to untie the celestial bonds.\n\n\"If, however, their early merits have already shone forth and their names are inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace, then they transcend traces and leave the dust behind—nothing in the world can burden them.\"\n\nSomeone further asked: \"Immortals must possess immortal bones. Without such bones, one cannot study immortality—what then?\"\n\nThe reply: \"A craftsman must work with the material at hand to apply his skill. A student must possess the proper bones to aspire to the Dao. Thus, ice cannot be carved, and the foolish cannot become immortals—this is the principle of nature. Those whose spirit is not clear and whose bones are not towering have not been endowed with the yang numinous qi. Without this endowment, they cannot harbor the heart that yearns for immortality. If one does yearn for immortality, none fail to be born with immortal bones.\"\n\nAsked again: \"Then can one with immortal bones who does not cultivate still attain it?\"\n\nReplied: \"To have bones yet not cultivate is like having material but no craftsman. Gold hidden in ore, if not smelted, remains stone. The Dao within a person, if not refined, remains common. Though one may lack bones and not become immortal, one cannot rely on bones alone to await effortless ascension.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Harmonizing Being with Non-Being**\nSomeone asked: \"The Dao is fundamentally formless, yet immortals value having form. To harmonize being with non-being—how can this principle endure long? Would it not be more wondrous to attain nature while shedding form?\"\n\nThe reply: \"The Dao is supremely empty and boundless, yet it contains spirit and moves qi, generating being from non-being. Thus, the vast and obscure void is the formless form of the Great Dao. Heaven and earth, sun and moon are the formed forms of the Great Dao. By non-being linking being, and being uniting with non-being, the cosmos endures forever, and immortals and sages never perish.\n\n\"Life is the great virtue of heaven and earth. It is because we possess form that we perceive the vastness of the six directions and the brilliance of the three luminaries. If one were to dissolve entirely into transformation, then heaven, earth, and the myriad things would no longer be one’s own—thus, death is the bitterest poison of human relations.\n\n\"Therefore, refining the common to become immortal, refining the immortal to become perfected, refining the perfected to unite with the subtle, uniting with the subtle to merge with spirit, and spirit merging with the Dao—then the Dao becomes one’s body. Thus, one ascends to the Jade Capital, roams the Golden Gates, can be or not be, neither ending nor perishing. How can this principle not endure long?\n\n\"Those who regard attaining nature alone as wondrous, unaware of the necessity of refining form, are but clear and spirited ghosts—how can they compare to lofty immortals?\"\n\nAsked again: \"Yet immortals existed in ancient times—why, once hidden, are they no longer seen?\"\n\nReplied: \"The pure and the turbid flow in separate streams; the true and the common dwell in different realms. How can they be seen? Nevertheless, Lord Lingwei returned briefly after a thousand years, and the Primordial One has descended repeatedly even to this day—how can one say they are no longer seen?\"\n\nAsked: \"Then who are the immortals of today?\"\n\nReplied: \"Since the Tang dynasty, some may be briefly mentioned. Liu Qingyun ascended from the land of Shu; Wei Junlong soared in Songyang. The Daoist adept shed his mortal form at the Great Unity; Dongxuan’s bones took flight in Jifang. Others, concealing their traces and withdrawing from the world, attained the Dao and ascended lightly—too many to record. These are all matters within living memory; how can they be falsified or obscured? Few understand the Dao, and thus few attain immortality. The supreme music does not delight the vulgar ear—alas!\"\n\n*The Treatise on the Mysterious Principles by Master Zongxuan* concludes.\n\n**The Transmission of Master Wu**\nWu Jun, styled Zhenjie, was a Confucian scholar from central Lu.\n\nIn his youth, he mastered the classics and excelled in composition, yet failed the imperial examinations. His nature was lofty and pure, refusing to align with common customs. Thus, he entered Mount Song, becoming a Daoist under Master Pan Shizheng of the Body of the Mysterious, and transmitted the Orthodox Unity teachings. Through diligent study and reverent inquiry, he fully grasped its arts.\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, he journeyed south to Jinling, seeking the Dao on Mount Mao, and later traveled east to Tiantai. Wu Jun was particularly skilled in writing; while in Ke and Yue, he gathered with literati for poetic and wine-filled gatherings, and his compositions circulated in the capital. Emperor Xuanzong, hearing of his reputation, dispatched an envoy to summon him. Upon arrival, the emperor was greatly pleased by their conversation and appointed him to await imperial commands in the Hanlin Academy. The emperor inquired about Daoist methods.\n\nWu Jun replied: \"The essence of Daoist methods is found in no text more perfect than the *Five Thousand Characters*. All other verbose and branching discourses are but a waste of paper and ink.\"\n\nThe emperor further asked about the cultivation of immortals and alchemical refinement.\n\nWu Jun answered: \"These are the concerns of rustics, to be pursued through years of practice and merit. They are not matters for a sovereign to indulge in.\"\n\nWhenever he sat among Daoists and Buddhist monks, or when court ministers presented memorials, Wu Jun’s remarks pertained solely to the teachings of names and the affairs of the world. When questioned, he would respond with subtle verses to convey his sincerity. Emperor Xuanzong held him in deep esteem.\n\nDuring the Tianbao era, as Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong wielded power, the moral order of the court daily eroded. Wu Jun, foreseeing the coming chaos, persistently requested to return to Mount Song, but his petitions were repeatedly denied. Instead, the emperor decreed the establishment of a separate Daoist abbey at the mountain’s temple. When An Lushan’s rebellion loomed, Wu Jun sought to return to Mount Mao, and this time his request was granted. Soon after, the Central Plains descended into turmoil, and bandits multiplied in the Jiangnan region. He then traveled to Kuaiji, frequently journeying between Tiantai and Ke. There, he exchanged poems with the poet Li Bai and Kong Chaofu, wandering among springs and rocks, with many following in his footsteps. He ultimately passed away in Yue.\n\nHis collected works comprise twenty scrolls, among which *The Mysterious Principles* in three chapters and *On the Learnability of Immortality* are especially praised by those of profound insight. In all his writings, the reasoning is vast and penetrating, the literary brilliance radiant—whenever he composed a piece, people would copy and circulate it widely. Even Li Bai’s unrestrained boldness and Du Fu’s majestic splendor—he alone, perhaps, could unite both in his work. The Tang Minister of Rites, Quan Deyu, composed this account.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the *Xuan Gang Lun* Presented to the Emperor**\n\nYour servant, the Daoist Wu Jun, respectfully submits: I have heard that the Dao relies on emptiness to achieve union, and principles depend on words to be made manifest. When I formerly dwelled in mountain caves, I composed writings on the practice of cultivation. I humbly consider that the Profound Mystery is deep and difficult to trace to its depths, while the Three Caverns are recondite and rarely does one glimpse their gate. This leaves those who turn toward the wind adrift and without foundation. Thus, I have gathered the essentials and called them the *Xuan Gang*. I hope that by following the current, one may return to the source, and that by expounding the subtle, its purport will not be lost. As for the signs of solitary transformation in the highest emptiness or the means by which the loftiest adepts ascend as immortals—matters unaddressed by former sages or omitted in the true scriptures—I have ventured to set forth my humble thoughts and arranged them in these chapters.\n\nI reverently consider that Your Majesty, the Sagely, Civil, Divine, and Martial Emperor Who Proves the Dao and Embodies Filial Virtue, is the sovereign of the Supreme Dao, who magnifies the teachings of spontaneity. All things flourish under the potter’s wheel of your governance, and the black-haired people are at peace within the realm of benevolence and longevity. How could a speck of dust add to the towering mountain, or a spark of fire aid the sun? Yet though this offering is slight, Your Sagely Luminance does not reject it. I dare to present these meager words, hoping they may catch a ray of celestial light. The old writings I have composed are respectfully submitted with this memorial. To trouble Your August Attention with such trifles fills me with trembling awe.\n\nYour servant Wu Jun, with utmost reverence and fear, bows his head again and again.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\nOn the eleventh day of the sixth month in the thirteenth year of the Tianbao era,\nYour servant Wu Jun, a Daoist of the Zhongyue Songyang Abbey, presents this memorial.\n\n---\n\n**The *Xuan Gang Lun* of Master Zongxuan**\n\n**First Scroll: Clarifying the Dao and Its Virtue (Nine Chapters)**\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao and Its Virtue**\n\nWhat is the Dao?\nIt is the lineage of emptiness and nothingness, the root of creation and transformation, the foundation of spirit and illumination, the source of heaven and earth. Vast beyond all bounds, subtle beyond all interiors, boundless and without limit, darkly obscure and without counterpart—so profoundly hidden it cannot be perceived, yet its great brilliance sheds light; so utterly still it has no mind, yet the ten thousand things attain their proper forms. Formless and indistinct, soundless and silent, the myriad images arise from it, and the five notes are completed through it. That which is born has its end, and that which is completed must decline. Birth after birth, completion after completion—this has never changed from ancient times to the present. This is called the Dao.\n\nWhat is virtue?\nIt is what heaven and earth receive, what yin and yang rely upon. It is ordered by the five phases and woven by the four seasons. Governed by the ruler, instructed by the teacher, the hidden and the manifest, the moving and the still—all flourish in accord with what is fitting. Its blessings flow without end, yet grasses grow without knowing to thank its merit. Its kindness extends without limit, yet the hundred clans do not know to rely on its power. This is called virtue.\n\nThus, that which pervades and gives life is called the Dao, and the Dao is fundamentally nameless. That which nurtures and brings to completion is called virtue, and virtue is fundamentally unnameable. Let us consider: heaven and earth, humans and things, spirits and immortals, ghosts and gods—without the Dao, none could be born; without virtue, none could be completed. That which is born does not know its beginning; that which is completed does not see its end. Though one delves into mysteries and seeks out subtleties, none can fathom its origin. It enters the end of being and emerges before non-being. None can exhaust its traces—it is called the spontaneous.\n\nThe spontaneous is the constant of the Dao and virtue, the warp of heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Two: Primordial Qi**\n\nBefore the great emptiness, what was there in the silence and desolation?\nThe purest essence stirred and responded, and the True One arose.\nThe True One moved with spirit, and primordial qi transformed of itself.\nPrimordial qi is being within non-being, non-being within being—boundless and immeasurable, subtle and imperceptible. Vaporous and gradually manifesting, indistinct and without boundary, it is the origin of the ten thousand images, the first sign of their emergence.\n\nThereupon, the clear, penetrating, and limpid qi floated upward to become heaven; the turbid, stagnant, and murky qi congealed below to become earth. The harmonious, gentle, and compliant qi coalesced to form human relationships; the errant, perverse, and harsh qi dispersed to become miscellaneous kinds. From the nurturing of this single qi, the ten thousand differences spread and species divided. Once they enter the mechanism of transformation, their changes are endless.\n\nThus, it is primordial qi that gives form to heaven, earth, humans, and things. It is spirit and illumination that bestow numinosity upon them. Therefore, Qian and Kun govern heaven and earth, while essence and soul direct humans and things. Qi undergoes the revolutions of yin and yang, but spirit knows no changes of cold or heat. Though its movements are manifold and its transformations innumerable, it perishes and revives again, ends and begins anew.

      "translated_text": "These all have no ancestor, no lineage, no beginning, no end. They embrace harmony and cherish compassion, pitying the benighted and mourning the deluded. Though their bodies differ in purity and turbidity, the true and the vulgar share no common ground.\n\nThey descend with qi and divide their radiance, thus born among men. Wise and enlightened, broadly accomplished, they take universal relief as their work. As rulers and leaders, they enable all things to flow freely. Passing through the ages, their mysterious merit is truly fulfilled. Their virtue transforms heaven and earth, their names inscribed in the imperial archives.\n\nThereupon, when the movement ceases in the Northern Capital, the mandate is marked in the Southern Palace. The primordial true descends, becoming the master of form. Once yin qi has fallen, the world’s dust is naturally obstructed. Refining the embryo and altering the substance, they cast off filth and remove decay. Spirit and form unite in harmony, and in broad daylight, they ascend lightly.\n\nThis is what is called returning to my homeland, returning to my constancy, and being boundless with the Dao—who then knows its method?\n\n**Heavenly Endowment, Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is fundamentally without movement or stillness, yet yin and yang arise from it. Qi is fundamentally without purity or turbidity, yet heaven and earth take shape from it. Pure yang blazes brightly above, for above the Nine Heavens there is no yin. Pure yin lies darkly below, for below the Nine Earths there is no yang. Yin and yang intermingle and steam forth, giving birth to the ten thousand existences. That which gives birth to the ten thousand existences resides precisely between heaven and earth.\n\nThus, the configurations of qi transform and shift, darkness and light take form. Yang, through clarity, is upright, and its essence becomes true numen. Yin, through obscurity, is perverse, and its essence becomes demonic specters. Therefore, those born endowed with yang numen are wise and sagacious, while those nurtured by yin specters are stubborn and fierce. The wise and sagacious are kind and harmonious, for yang delights in giving life. The stubborn and fierce are perverse and violent, for yin delights in killing.\n\nSome are good, some are not—these two qi combine equally to produce the mediocre. Each of the three receives its endowment differently, so where should teaching be applied? Teaching is applied for the mediocre alone. Why? The wise and sagacious know without being taught, while the stubborn and fierce, though taught, do not change. These all receive the pure qi of yin and yang. It is like fire, which can be extinguished but cannot be made cold, or ice, which can melt but cannot be made hot. Such is the inherent principle.\n\nWhen the mediocre do good, harmonious qi responds; when they do evil, harmful qi gathers. Thus, accumulating good brings surplus blessings, while accumulating evil brings surplus misfortune. With blessings and misfortunes, teaching is thereby established.\n\n**Nature and Emotion, Chapter Five**\nThat which gives me life is the Dao; that which endows me is spirit. Yet longevity or early death, departure or abiding—these do not depend on oneself. Why? Because nature moves and becomes emotion, and emotion turns against the Dao. Thus, one is moved by the mechanism of transformation and cannot maintain oneself.\n\nTo transcend the realm of existence and nonexistence, to lodge the heart in the realm of self-attainment—why should it be so? The Dao can be one’s teacher, and spirit can be one’s friend. How is this so? The Dao and spirit act without striving, and qi transforms of itself; they deliberate without thought, and things complete themselves. They enter into the ranks of the myriad kinds and emerge beyond the bounds of life and death.\n\nTherefore, the noble person rejects desires, quiets brilliance, sees without color, hears without sound. Serene and pure, embodying harmony and spirit clarity, empty and at ease, forgetting the self—only then do they unite with the utmost essence. This is what is called returning to my origin, reverting to unity with the Dao. United with the Dao, then the workings of creation cannot alter them, ghosts and spirits cannot know them—how much less can men?\n\n**Transcending Movement and Stillness, Chapter Six**\nThe Dao is utterly without form, yet it gives birth to heaven and earth. Heaven moves, yet the Northern Asterism does not shift, and the qi it contains does not diminish. Earth is still, yet the eastern flow does not cease, and the arising of clouds does not exhaust. Thus, stillness is the heart of heaven and earth, and movement is the qi of heaven and earth. The heart is still, and qi moves—this is how they cover and bear without limit.\n\nTherefore, those who penetrate the Dao, though they soar beyond the cosmos, their hearts remain ever tranquil. Though they rest within the finest hair’s breadth, their qi moves of itself. Thus, if the heart is not tranquil, there is no way to unite with the Dao; if qi does not move, there is no way to preserve form. When form is preserved and the Dao is united, this is the virtue of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, one who moves yet does not know they move has transcended movement. One who is still yet does not know they are still has gone beyond stillness. Therefore, one who has transcended movement cannot be pushed by yang. One who has gone beyond stillness cannot be shifted by yin. Yin and yang cannot alter them—how much less can the ten thousand things?\n\nThus, one who is not enticed by things is called utmost stillness. Only after utmost stillness can one unite with utmost emptiness. When emptiness reaches its limit, there is clarity; when clarity reaches its limit, there is luminosity; when luminosity reaches its limit, there is penetration. The penetrating one, though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things abundant, cannot escape the mirror of the square inch.\n\n**Uniting Being and Nonbeing, Chapter Seven**\nThe Dao encompasses countless numbers yet is not great; it penetrates the tip of an autumn hair yet is not small. It precedes emptiness and nothingness yet is not a beginning; it follows heaven and earth yet is not an end. It ascends and accumulates yang yet is not bright; it sinks into heavy yin yet is not dark.\n\nOriginally without spirit, when emptiness reaches its limit, spirit arises of itself. Originally without qi, when spirit moves, qi transforms of itself. Qi is originally without substance; when it congeals and accumulates, it forms shape. Shape is originally without emotion; when it is put to use, it harms nature. Once shape is formed and nature moves, one drifts ever farther from the Dao.\n\nThus, one is submerged in life and death, shifted by yin and yang, unable to maintain oneself—not because the Dao exists and then perishes. Therefore, if the Dao can generate being from nonbeing, how could it not make being unite with nonbeing? If being unites with nonbeing, then being does not perish.\n\nThus, that which gives me life is the Dao; that which destroys me is emotion. If one forgets emotion, then nature is preserved whole. When nature is whole, form is whole; when form is whole, qi is whole; when qi is whole, spirit is whole; when spirit is whole, the Dao is whole. When the Dao is whole, spirit is sovereign; when spirit is sovereign, qi is numinous; when qi is numinous, form transcends; when form transcends, nature is penetrating; when nature is penetrating, it circulates and flows back, uniting with the Dao as one.\n\nOne can make being into nonbeing, make emptiness into fullness. I shall be a companion to the creator—how can life and death burden me?",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Eight: Transforming the Customs of the Age**\n\nThe Dao and its virtue are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Emperors and kings are the lords of the Three Powers. Thus, the Dao and its virtue, Heaven and Earth, and emperors and kings are one. Yet why do they differ in ancient and modern times, in simplicity and decadence, in the order of Yao and the chaos of Jie?\n\nThe Dao and its virtue know no rise or decline; human relations know prosperity and adversity. Past and present do not change; only nature and emotion shift. Thus, when the era is about to prosper, the utmost yang and true essence descend to become its ruler, the worthy assist while the wicked submit. When the era is about to decline, the great yin and pure essence ascend to become its lord, the wicked aid while the worthy withdraw. The Dao of Heaven and Earth follows the reckoning of yin and yang, hence the divergence between order and chaos.\n\nThat the ancients were simple while the moderns are decadent is like a person being foolish in youth and wise in maturity. Before an infant can speak, it embodies the pristine purity of high antiquity. As it begins to discern, it upholds the benevolence and righteousness of the middle age. When it reaches the age for learning, it reveres the rites and wisdom of the later age. In adulthood, with many desires, it competes in vanity and falsehood, like the degenerate era. Such is the principle of transformation and the suitability of customs, hence the difference between simplicity and decadence.\n\nTracing the cause and source, one’s nature shifts through study, and people scatter their original simplicity by following the times. Nevertheless, a father must teach his son, and a ruler must govern his people. Teaching a son lies in proper conduct; governing people lies in the Dao and its virtue. If proper conduct is lost, teachers and friends cannot instruct; if the Dao and its virtue are forsaken, rites and music cannot be ordered. Even with punishments and floggings, it is difficult to restrain treacherous ministers and rebellious sons.\n\nThus, instructing the young with no deceit preserves loyalty and trust. Transforming the customs of the age with purity and simplicity brings harmony with Heaven’s peace. Therefore, those who do not grasp the Dao and its virtue to govern people have never attained the ultimate principle.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Clarifying Root and Branch**\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, rites, and wisdom are the great principles of imperial governance. Yet why does the Daoist school alone speak of abandoning benevolence and righteousness and belittling rites and wisdom?\n\nThe Dao values what is fundamental. Thus, utmost benevolence aligns with the virtue of Heaven and Earth; utmost righteousness aligns with their suitability; utmost rites align with their form; utmost wisdom aligns with their discernment. All are naturally endowed, not something that can be attained through mere admiration. To forcefully imitate them is to become false. When falsehood arises, myriad deceptions sprout, and laws cannot govern them.\n\nThus, the ancients prized simplicity and despised decadence, valued the Dao and its virtue internally while placing benevolence and righteousness externally, prioritized plainness and simplicity over rites and wisdom—to strengthen the root and secure the branch. Like deep roots yielding flourishing branches, a deep source yielding a long flow, this is not to abandon benevolence and righteousness or belittle rites and wisdom.\n\nWhen the Dao is lost, virtue remains; when virtue declines, benevolence remains; when benevolence wanes, righteousness remains; when righteousness is lacking, rites remain. When rites collapse, chaos follows, and wisdom becomes sufficient to dominate the world. Thus, rites and wisdom are the great barriers against chaos, while the Dao and its virtue are the grand principles for governing it.\n\nTherefore, the Dao and its virtue are the root of rites, while rites and wisdom are the branch of the Dao. Grasping the root is easy and secure; holding the branch is difficult and perilous. Thus, if a ruler takes the Dao as his heart, virtue as his body, benevolence and righteousness as his chariot and robes, and rites and wisdom as his crown and cap, he may govern with folded arms and transform the world. If he exalts rites and wisdom while forgetting the Dao and its virtue, his actions will have outward adornment but no inner spirit. Though he toils day and night, the world will fall into decay.\n\nThus, the Three Sovereigns transformed the world with the Dao; the Five Emperors governed it with virtue; the Three Kings ordered it with benevolence and righteousness; the Five Hegemons led it with rites and wisdom. The Three Sovereigns achieved perfect governance; the Five Hegemons nearly brought chaos. Therefore, abandoning the Dao and its virtue to rely solely on rites and wisdom is not the way of ruling. Only by first clarifying the Dao and its virtue can rites and wisdom be properly esteemed.\n\nLaozi said: \"Rites are the decline of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos. Govern with wisdom, and it becomes the state’s bane; govern without wisdom, and it becomes the state’s blessing.\" This means that when rites are lacking, chaos arises; when wisdom changes, deceit follows. Thus, one must block the source of chaos and sever the root of deceit.\n\nYet scholars like Yang Xiong and Ban Gu all claim that Daoists belittle benevolence and righteousness, disparage rites and wisdom, and rely solely on emptiness and tranquility—this is because worldly Confucians do not grasp the profound intent of the mysterious sages.\n\n**Middle Section: Discourses on Methods and Teachings (Fifteen Chapters in Total)**\n\n**Chapter Ten: Establishing Teachings Through the Divine Dao**\n\nAt the inception of the Nine Mysteries, the Two Images had not yet taken form. A numinous wind gathered in subtlety, and emptiness congealed into splendor. Precious scriptures coalesced in primordial unity; jade characters marked solitary transformation. Emerging between being and nonbeing, radiant before the dark and yellow, the sun and moon drew from it to illuminate, Heaven and Earth relied on it to cover and support.\n\nThen, the Supreme Void Sovereign commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to inscribe it on golden tablets and arrange it in jade chapters. Initially hidden in the highest mystery, its influence later flowed down to the earth. Descending to observe the worthy, it bestowed this text. Thus, Fuxi received the Diagram, Xuanyuan received the Talisman, Gaoxin received the Heavenly Classic, and Great Yu received the Luo River Writing—here began the establishment of teachings through the divine Dao.\n\nLater, the Mysterious Origin sought to transform customs, serving as imperial teacher through the ages. When human relations grew decadent, it set forth the Dao and its virtue to restore simplicity. When ghosts and spirits caused disturbances, it expounded the Alliance of Might to dispel evil. Extending to Su, Mao, the Zhou kings, Pei, Wei, Yang, and Xu, none failed to personally receive the mysterious sages and transmit the precious scriptures. Thus, the Western Terrace did not conceal its numinous texts, nor did the Eastern Flower withhold its true instructions. Hence, dragon scripts and cloud seals gradually descended to humanity, with masters and disciples passing them down, and the scriptures and methods ever expanding.\n\nYet while they may be surveyed in full, it is difficult to practice them entirely. Why? Because one person’s heart, burdened with the Dao of many sages, grows weary in spirit and exhausted in form, unable to fathom their subtleties.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, by comprehensive study to dispel doubt and by focused practice to attain subtlety, one neither neglects cultivation nor abandons tranquility and harmony. The Dao resides in utmost refinement, not in the pursuit of breadth alone.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Learning Proceeds in Order**\nThough the Dao has no fixed form, learning proceeds in order. Therefore, one begins with *Zhengyi*, advances to *Dongshen*, abides in *Lingbao*, and rests in *Dongzhen*. All take utmost stillness as their foundation, concentrated thought as their function, fasting and purification as their duty, and compassion and kindness as their priority. Without utmost stillness, the spirit does not congeal; without concentrated thought, resonance is not thorough; without fasting and purification, the true does not respond; without compassion and kindness, merit is not achieved. When the spirit congeals, resonance is thorough, the true responds, and merit is accomplished, this is called the first step of the immortal’s ascent. Thereafter, one refines the viscera through exhalation and inhalation, harmonizes the body through guiding and stretching, cherishes the spirit through treasuring the scriptures, and nourishes the bones with jade-like nectar—all in accordance with the master’s instructions, delving into the profound mysteries of the true. Then, qi and fluids flow unimpeded, form and spirit unite as one, and without need of golden elixirs or jade fungi, one may await cloud-plowing and feathered canopies. If one regards mere breath control as subtlety, bending and stretching as essential, medicinal tonics as the task, and miscellaneous arts as profit, this is to know how to nourish the form but not how to treasure the spirit. Those who do not treasure the spirit, though they may live as long as tortoises or cranes, will never attain the hope of immortality.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: When Yang Prevails, One Becomes an Immortal**\nYang and yin coexist, and thus humans are born. The hun is the yang spirit, the po is the yin numen. They intertwine to form the embryo, circulate qi, nurture the body, and construct the form. Yet their power is never complete; if complete, each returns to its origin. Thus, when yin prevails, yang is exhausted and one dies; when yang prevails, yin is dissolved and one becomes an immortal. Gentleness, kindness, integrity, and purity are yang. Harshness, malice, jealousy, and impurity are yin. When the heart is serene and empty, yang harmony pervades the mind; when restless and desirous, yin qi enters the light. These two are controlled by oneself. When yang prevails and yin is subdued, this is the beginning of longevity. This beginning is the first step of the immortal’s path, the threshold of undying.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Emptiness and Clarity Merge with the Origin**\nThe Dao does not desire a heart set on anything; with such a heart, true qi does not gather. Yet it also does not desire forced forgetfulness; if the heart is forcibly forgotten, external evils take residence. It lies in equanimity and tranquility, clarity and subtlety, emptiness and clarity merging with the origin, responding unfailingly to all stimuli. Respond but do not cling, and truth and falsehood become distinct. If my heart does not incline, nothing is not upright. If thoughts are attached to anything, nothing is not perverse. The coming of perversity or uprightness lies within myself. Though one may esteem emptiness, oblivion, and the abandonment of form and thought, without profound resonance and far-reaching clarity, one cannot penetrate the mysterious and attain the true. Thus, advanced learners who rest in contemplation are overcome by the yin corpse’s qi; those who listen to diligent zeal are dominated by the yang harmony’s spirit. Those who alternate between rest and diligence are still in the midst of battle. The key lies in disciplining the self, rousing one’s conduct, and resolutely opposing laxity and indolence, ensuring that concentration remains unbroken. Those who persevere in this will see the corpse dissolve and the spirit reign. When the spirit reigns, this is called yang prevailing. When yang prevails, the Dao is near.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Refining Yin with Yang**\nYang is fire, yin is water. Ice and charcoal cannot share the same vessel; victory and defeat each have their destination. The Daoist and the commoner reverse their natures, and each refines differently. The multitude refines yang with yin, while the Daoist refines yin with yang. Refining yang with yin leads from strength to old age, from old age to decline, from decline to senility, from senility to illness, and from illness to death. Refining yin with yang leads from old age back to infancy, from turbidity back to clarity, from decline back to vigor, from coarseness back to refinement, from illness back to harmony, and from premature death back to longevity, gradually aligning with the true Dao to attain immortality. Thus, if even a trace of yang remains unextinguished, one does not reach death. If even a fraction of yin remains unvanquished, one does not attain immortality. Immortals transcend utmost yang to unite with the true; the dead sink into great yin to become ghosts. This is called each following its kind. Therefore, embracing primordial harmony, holding to pure unity, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, guiding and stretching, concentrating the mind in stillness, and maintaining effortless detachment—all aim to refine yin stagnation with yang numinosity, making inner and outer empty and bright, thoroughly merging with the utmost true. Those who persevere in this—is immortality far away?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: When the Form Moves, the Heart is Still**\nWhen the form moves yet the heart is still, the spirit congeals while the traces shift—this is non-action. When dwelling in leisure yet the spirit is disturbed, or when outwardly reverent yet the heart wanders—this is action. Non-action brings order; action brings chaos. Though non-action is supremely easy, only the utmost enlightened can attain it. Heaven and earth are non-active by day and by night; their non-action is one, yet order and chaos differ. Why? By day, non-action is bright, so the multitude of yang appears while the yin of plants lies hidden. By night, non-action is dark, so the yin of plants moves while the multitude of yang rests. Thus, when the ruler is enlightened and non-active, the loyal and good advance while the treacherous and flattering withdraw, and the world is well-governed. When the ruler is benighted and non-active, the loyal and good retreat while the treacherous and flattering take office, and the world falls into chaos. Therefore, the enlightened practice non-action with wisdom, while the benighted practice non-action in confusion. Wisdom leads to communion with the Dao; confusion leads to conformity with things. Though both the Dao and things are non-active, how can they be the same? Thus, though the perfected value non-action, they cannot fail to discern. Only those who discern and yet remain non-active can truly be called non-active.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: When the Spirit is Clear and the Mind is Calm**\nAdvanced learners at times feel elation and distant aspirations, delighting in the realm of self-attainment, believing that true immortals may be encountered and the celestial vaults ascended—this is the spirit reigning. Though the spirit may reign, one must still guard against the dissipation of yang harmony’s qi and the encroachment of yin evil’s qi.",
      "overlap_context": "Terrace did not conceal its numinous texts, nor did the Eastern Flower withhold its true instructions. Hence, dragon scripts and cloud seals gradually descended to humanity, with masters and disciples passing them down, and the scriptures and methods ever expanding.\n\nYet while they may be surveyed in full, it is difficult to practice them entirely. Why? Because one person’s heart, burdened with the Dao of many sages, grows weary in spirit and exhausted in form, unable to fathom their subtleties.",

      "translated_text": "One may enter a quiet chamber to pacify the mind, restraining whatever arises. In stillness and silence, with single-minded focus, the spirit remains undispersed, and the yang numen remains whole. Take care not to indulge in the emotions of joy and ease, lest yin evil’s qi arrive. As the ancients said: when joy departs, sorrow comes; when yang wanes, yin prevails.\n\nShould there be moments of restlessness, agitation, or vexation, this is because the various po within the form are being refined by the yang numen’s qi, and the accumulated stagnation of the yin corpse is about to disperse—thus disturbing the true within the Crimson Palace. One may enter the chamber to settle the thoughts, preserve the One and clench the fists, expel the turbid dregs, and await the spirit’s clarity and qi’s calm. Then, reflecting on one’s errors and repenting, one must strive for self-renewal. Thus turning to align with the path of emptiness and stillness, this is also one of the arts of cleansing the mind.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Conduct Pure, Heart Steadfast**\nConduct should be pure, the heart steadfast. Let speech not exceed conduct, and conduct not betray the heart—then one roams the crossroads of the four directions. The crossroads of the four directions are the thoroughfares of traversing the Dao. In ceaseless conduct, heaven and earth cherish one, the numinous powers protect one; misfortune and violence cannot befall, and ghosts and spirits cannot disturb.\n\nIf speech is pure yet conduct is turbid, the name immaculate yet the traces defiled—though shame is concealed outwardly, the heart is deluded inwardly. When the heart is deluded inwardly, heaven and earth detest one, the numinous powers pursue one. Though one may exert great effort in the Dao, attainment is impossible. Thus, it is better to endure others’ slander than to incur heaven’s censure. Human slander may be dispelled, but heaven’s censure cannot be evaded.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The True Person as Companion**\nWhat the Dao most abhors is harm, killing, yin treachery—these are indeed easy to guard against. As for minor likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals, the common emotions of people, these are most difficult to be cautious of. One should not allow even the slightest matter to disturb the square inch of the heart. When thoughts are still and the spirit at ease, evil qi cannot enter. When one’s will is undisturbed, the true person becomes one’s companion.\n\nMoreover, those who love praise and hate slander are not the way of the worthy and enlightened. Yet if one examines oneself and finds no goodness yet receives praise, it is inauspicious. If one reflects and finds no fault yet is slandered, what harm is there? In this discussion, gain and loss lie within oneself, not elsewhere. Thus, those who remain serene, \"forgetting emotions,\" unmoved by beauty or ugliness in their hearts—these are the perfected, the perfected indeed.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Benevolence, Clarity, Steadfastness, and Stillness**\nThose who are benevolent, clear, steadfast, and still—broadly accomplished and brilliantly outstanding—are all those in whom the qi of heaven and humanity is divided, descending to be born to aid the times and benefit things. When their accumulated merit is complete across generations, their names are recorded in the Cinnabar Terrace. The primordial and steadfast flow in the Supreme Mystery; the upright qi densely gathers in the Pass Palace. Naturally, the po are refined and the corpse extinguished, the spirit congeals and the body becomes pure. When the yin dregs are entirely dissolved, one merges with the form and ascends lightly.\n\nThus, the immortals of old were never anything but heaven-born humans. To make the walking corpse share their inclinations—is this not difficult? Some accumulate cultivation and layered practice yet do not attain ascension—why? Their prior merit has not yet manifested. Some do not rely on cultivation yet spontaneously attain immortality—why? Their past conduct was fully sufficient.\n\nMerit is not built in vain; goodness is not bestowed without cause. If one sees others attaining without effort, yet oneself does not, then one must reflect on one’s own life and breath. To witness spontaneous feathered transformation and claim that merit does not depend on human effort—this is far from the truth.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Establishing Merit, Correcting Errors**\nMerit should be concealed; errors should be exposed. Concealed merit can be preserved; exposed errors can be eradicated. If merit is not preserved and errors are not eradicated, how can one’s name be recorded in the immortal registers, and long life be hoped for?\n\nYet merit need not be great—meeting things, one rescues them. Errors need not be small—recognizing wrongdoing, one becomes wise. One need not rush to establish merit or hasten to correct errors. If errors are corrected and not repeated, and merit is established without wearying halfway, this is called daily renewing one’s virtue, and heaven will protect one. For such as these, why must one wait for the eight solar terms or the three primal days to speak of merit and repent errors? The numinous and true are ever watchful—this is their constant way.\n\nMoreover, in repenting errors and praying with reflection, one must be sincere and earnest, directing one’s sincere will and focused heart toward the Three Clarities, as if standing before the Golden Portals. There is no need to prostrate the body or recite words of supplication. If one merely adds bowing, kneeling, knocking the head, and reciting ordinary texts, this may be called displaying minor goodness to others, but it is truly not the grand rule of moving and inspiring.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Restraining Evil, Cultivating Good**\nThe essence of yang is called the hun and the spirit; the essence of yin is called the corpse and the po. When the spirit prevails, one does good; when the corpse is strong, one does evil. Restraining evil and cultivating good is order; forgetting good and indulging evil is chaos. With order prolonged, the corpse is extinguished and the po refined. With chaos prolonged, the spirit departs and the hun dissolves.\n\nThus, when the corpse is extinguished and the po refined, the spirit and form merge to become an immortal. When the spirit departs and the hun dissolves, the corpse and po unite to become a ghost. This is the natural Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Emptying the Will to Whiteness**\nThe spirit and hun favor purity; the corpse and po favor filth. One should always empty the will to whiteness and bathe the form in snow, so that the spirit and hun delight in well-being, and the corpse and po are refined and extinguished. When the spirit is at peace and the corpse is extinguished, one becomes daily clearer and fresher. Though one may not yet ascend lightly, I must call this an immortal.\n\nMoreover, sorrow, grief, and suffering are companions of yin. Joy, pleasure, and ease are companions of yang. Thus, when the heart is sorrowful, yin gathers; when the will is joyful, yang disperses. Neither sorrowful nor joyful, serene and non-active—this is called primordial harmony. Without primordial harmony, one cannot attain the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Entrusting the Heart to Spontaneity**\nThe eyes delight in seductive beauty as splendor; the heart values fame and reputation. The body favors light and fine adornments; the mouth craves rare and exquisite flavors. The ears enjoy wondrous and beautiful sounds; the nose delights in fragrant and sweet scents. These six all corrupt virtue and harm nature, and are called the axes that fell the numinous root.\n\nThus, if one possesses them, one may distance oneself; if one lacks them, there is no need to seek them. Only clothing and food are essential to people—yet even these are one of the pitfalls for those who pursue the Dao.",

One must forget one’s pursuits and allow things to follow their natural course.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Emptying, Concentrating, Stillness, and Breath**\nWaking unites with yang; sleep merges with yin. Excessive waking strengthens the hun-soul; prolonged sleep fortifies the po-soul. A strong hun-soul belongs to the living; a robust po-soul belongs to the dead. If one feasts on primordial harmony, purges rich flavors, and thereby clarifies the spirit and refreshes the qi, attaining wakefulness day and night—only in empty concentration and still breath is there nothing greater.\n\n**Nine Chapters on Resolving Obstructions: Lower Section**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Meeting Heavenly Principle**\nSomeone asked: \"When the human heart is left to its own devices for long, it becomes vast and forgets to return; when suddenly reined in, it leaps beyond all bounds.

What method can one who seeks the Dao use to attain stillness?\"\n\nI replied: \"Nature is originally most concentrated, moved only by external stimuli. Once stirred, the habit of movement grows over time—how can it suddenly become tranquil? Having grown accustomed to movement and drifted far, one may grow accustomed to stillness and become serene. Thus, those who cultivate stillness well achieve tranquility with ease; those who do so poorly become troubled without result. Therefore, when agitation arises, restrain it with calm; when deviance arises, guard it with integrity; when seeking arises, suppress it with relinquishment; when isolation arises, clarify it with purity. Leisurely and at ease, neither desiring nor scheming—then take the mysterious and empty as your domain, the indifferent and remote as your city gates, the Great Harmony as your palace, and silent illumination as your sun and moon. Be only precise and subtle, neither neglecting nor overstepping. Act thus, rest thus, be hasty thus, be carefree thus. One who practices this for long will find things darkening outside while the spirit mirrors within. Without seeking stillness, one becomes still; without pursuing peace, one becomes ever more peaceful. Then movement and stillness are both forgotten, and Heavenly Principle naturally converges. Thus, treading on frost is the beginning of solid ice; cultivating stillness is the step to attaining the Dao. Did the ancients not say, 'Accumulated habits become constant'? This is what they meant.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Revering the Spirit-Way**\nSomeone asked: \"Humans have good and evil—do Heaven, Earth, and the spirit luminaries all know of them?\"\n\nI replied: \"What words are these? What words are these? The heart is the abode of the spirit numen, where the spirit dwells. If the heart schemes, the spirit knows of it. If the spirit knows, then Heaven, Earth, and the spirit luminaries all know of it. There has never been good or evil not schemed in the heart. Once schemed in the heart, the spirit-way perceives it, leaving no escape even by a hair’s breadth. With no escape even by a hair’s breadth, then the blessing of good and the calamity of excess will not err. Someone asked: 'Why did Yan Hui die young, Ran Qiu suffer illness, the thief Zhi live long, Zhuang Shan grow wealthy, King Mu of Chu become a hegemon, and Tian Dan prosper?' I replied: 'The Way of Heaven is distant; the way of humans is near. The effects of karmic retribution are difficult to measure in speed. Thus, the noble may meet their fate, and the petty may have good fortune—but good and ill fortune intertwine in ways not limited to a single form. Therefore, the classic says: \"The net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide, yet nothing escapes.\" It also says: \"What goes around comes around.\" Thus, the principle of karmic retribution is clear. Why must everything be verified in the present?'\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Following Nature and Concentrating the Spirit**\nSomeone asked: \"The spirit presides over stillness—why then does the heart have desires?\"\n\nI replied: \"The spirit is the most numinous of the formless. The spirit is endowed by the Dao, still and in harmony with nature. Humans perceive through the spirit, moving and in harmony with emotion. Thus, following nature concentrates the spirit; following emotion disturbs it. Prolonged concentration stills the spirit; extreme disturbance scatters it. Stillness gives life; scattering brings death—all shifted by emotion, not commanded by the spirit. Someone asked: 'Then who transforms nature into emotion?' I replied: 'Internally, it is the qi of the yin-corpse that rebels; externally, it is the allure of sounds and sights that seduces. Accumulated habits become vast and unruly, unable to settle—this is not what the spirit desires to move.'\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Dao Reverses Custom**\nSomeone asked: \"What people most love is what Daoists most abhor—why is this?\"\n\nI replied: \"Fortune and longevity are what people desire; misfortune and early death are what they detest. Yet they do not know that what they most love invites misfortune and early death, while desirelessness brings lasting fortune and longevity. In such excessive pursuit, they harm themselves—how deeply deluded they are! Moreover, the seductive beauties of Yan and Zhao are nature’s enemies. The lewd music of Zheng and Wei is the spirit’s foe. Rare delicacies and fine wine cloud the heart. Official robes and caps burden the body. Abandoning these four brings stillness; pursuing them brings disturbance. Forgetting them brings longevity; indulging in them brings early death. Thus, they are what Daoists most abhor.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Focusing Single-Mindedly on the Supreme Dao**\nSomeone asked: \"In ancient times, those who studied immortality were many, yet those who attained the Dao were few—why is this?\"\n\nI replied: \"Among a thousand common people who study the Dao, one understands it. Among a thousand who understand it, one is determined to follow it. Among a thousand determined, one focuses single-mindedly. Among a thousand who focus, one persists long and diligently. Thus, learners are many, but those who succeed are few. If one understands the Dao and can sever worldly ties, and one who severs worldly ties can establish resolve, and one who establishes resolve can focus single-mindedly, and one who focuses can persist long and diligently—there has never been one who studied and did not attain it. Someone asked: 'Then must those who govern the world give up hope of immortality?' I replied: 'Not so. If one is specially endowed with true qi and broadly shelters the living, then governing the world is not an obstacle. But if an ordinary person loves the Dao and yearns to ascend lightly, they must rely on secluded dwelling.'\"",

The ears enjoy wondrous and beautiful sounds; the nose delights in fragrant and sweet scents. These six all corrupt virtue and harm nature, and are called the axes that fell the numinous root.\n\nThus, if one possesses them, one may distance oneself; if one lacks them, there is no need to seek them. Only clothing and food are essential to people—yet even these are one of the pitfalls for those who pursue the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Fuxi inherited from the Qi Mother, the Yellow Emperor ascended through cloud-plowing, Zhuanxu dwelled in the Dark Palace, and Yu the Great roamed the Purple Court—all were those who governed the world yet attained the Dao. As for Laozi serving as the Archivist, Zhuangzi as the Keeper of the Lacquer Garden, Wang Qiao in Huaye County, and Fang Hu ascending the Golden Gate—these too were those who aided their times yet attained the Dao.\n\nMoreover, immortals desire seclusion, and the Dao values namelessness. Some reveal their traces, while others conceal their tracks; they cannot be discerned by a single path nor inferred by a single principle. According to the *True Declarations* and Ge Hong’s *Records of the Primordial Immortals*, since ancient times, those of utmost loyalty, utmost filial piety, utmost sincerity, and utmost integrity—those who have rendered great service to the world—have all attained something, differing from the common stream. Yao, Shun, the Zhou kings, Confucius, Yi Yin, and Lü Shang—all these former sages and worthies were promoted to immortal ranks, which is what is meant by \"those who die yet do not perish live long.\"\n\nMoreover, Baihua, though following the world, feared death and yearned for immortality; after passing, he became a spirit official, his bones undecayed. Once his merits were fulfilled, his spirit and flesh reunited with his remains, his soul returned to his form, and in an instant, he ascended lightly. If even those with but a single virtue do not lose their reward, how much more so for those who devote themselves entirely to the pursuit of immortality?\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The Preciousness of Long Life**\nSomeone asked: \"Of the great essentials of the Dao, none precede Laozi and Zhuangzi. Yet Laozi and Zhuangzi did not esteem the immortal way—why then do you alone prize immortality?\"\n\nI replied: \"How can you say they did not esteem it? It is said: 'Laozi spoke of \"those who die yet do not perish live long,\"' and again, 'May your descendants’ sacrifices never cease.' Zhuangzi said, 'Who can regard life and death as a single thread?' and again, 'The sage treats the body as an inn.' Are these not proofs?\"\n\nI answered: \"The mysterious sages established their teachings for the common people. Not all who enter the Dao must become immortals. Thus, they first taught them to cultivate their nature. To cultivate one’s nature, one must pacify the heart; when the heart is calm, the spirit harmonizes, and the Dao may be hoped for. Of all things for humans, none is greater than life and death—who can be without feeling? When feeling stirs, nature is diminished, hastening death. If one is content in life and unafraid of death, carefree and at ease, forgetting both sorrow and joy, then feeling is extinguished while nature remains; the form perishes, yet the spirit endures. This is still better than the total loss of both form and nature, hence the saying of equating life and death—this is the utmost. How can you say they did not esteem immortality?\n\n\"The reason humans die is the form; what does not perish is nature. The sages did not esteem the body because it is the dwelling of the spirit and the vessel of nature. What they prized was the spirit and nature. If one fears death and regards the body as real, this is the way of cultivating the self, not the subtlety of cultivating the true. Laozi said: 'Deep roots and firm stems are the way of long life and enduring vision,' and again, 'The valley spirit does not die.' Zhuangzi said: 'After a thousand years, weary of the world, one departs and ascends as an immortal, riding the white clouds to the imperial realm.' Again: 'Thus, I cultivated myself for twelve hundred years, yet my form never once declined.' Again: 'Riding the clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, to roam beyond the four seas.' Again: 'All people die completely, yet I alone endure.' Again: 'When the spirit guards the form, the form attains long life.' Thus, Laozi and Zhuangzi’s words on long life and immortality are clear—how can you say they did not esteem it?\n\n\"Moreover, the *Dao De Jing* and *Nanhua Treatise* largely elucidate the Dao to instruct the world, emphasizing the root to still the branches. The mysteries of immortality are preserved but not discussed. Their esoteric chapters and hidden texts, the wondrous ways of refining the true, are concealed within the Three Caverns and transmitted only to the worthy. Those who lightly disclose them incur the wrath of the celestial officials, while those who revere them have their names recorded in the mysterious registers. Blessings and misfortunes extend to nine generations, and rise and fall affect the individual. How can those who are but walking corpses be allowed to hear and see everything?\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: The Dao Does Not Abandon Things**\nSomeone asked: \"Things arise from the Dao, and the Dao does not abandon things—why then are those who attain the Dao long-lived, while those who lose it perish?\"\n\nI replied: \"The dragon and the fish both grow in water; light and darkness both arise from the Dao. The dragon summons clouds and dispenses rain, emerging from being and entering non-being. The fish delights among the algae but withers when the spring dries. The dragon grasps the subtlety of water and can transform through it; the fish does not grasp the subtlety of water and cannot transform through it. The superior person dwells in spirit and refines qi, soaring above the celestial vastness. The inferior person harms nature and shortens life, sinking beneath the dark earth. The superior person grasps the subtlety of the Dao and can transform through it; the inferior person does not grasp the subtlety of the Dao and cannot transform through it.\n\n\"Thus, the fish does not know that water gives it life and abandons it—not that water abandons the fish. People do not know that the Dao gives them life and abandon it—not that the Dao abandons people.\"\n\nSomeone said: \"Dragons and fish differ in nature; light and darkness differ in endowment. How can fish transform through water or commoners transform through the Dao?\"\n\nI answered: \"If a fish can dive into deep abysses, hide in secluded caves, and not covet bait, then when it grows large, it will thrash its scales and lash its fins, leaping over Lüliang to become a dragon. If a person can wander Mount Kongtong, rest in tranquility, and sever desires, then when they reach perfection, they will embrace subtlety and契虚, tread the true realm, and become an immortal. The regret is that they conceal themselves insufficiently and guard their spirit inadequately—how could water or the Dao betray the fish or people?\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Discerning Acceptance and Rejection**\nSomeone asked: \"Immortality is the highest beauty for humans, and death is the greatest evil. Yet throughout the ages, gentlemen have known this, yet those who follow the common way are many, while those who practice immortality are few—why is this?\"",

      "translated_text": "Someone replied: \"There are two reasons for this. First, those whose endowment of qi is not lofty will find their aspirations difficult to broaden. Thus, they drown in immediate affairs, forget far-reaching vision, are muddled by fame and reputation, and obscured by desires. In the end, they remain entangled in the world’s net, never treading the true realm. Second, though some may be endowed with refined qi and a spirit of transcendent excellence, if their merit in aiding others is not yet complete and the path to immortality remains distant, they linger in mortal ranks, unable to untie the celestial bonds.\n\n\"If, however, their early merits have already shone forth and their names are inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace, then they transcend traces and leave the dust behind—nothing in the world can burden them.\"\n\nSomeone further asked: \"Immortals must possess immortal bones. Without such bones, one cannot study immortality—what then?\"\n\nThe reply: \"A craftsman must work with the material at hand to apply his skill. A student must possess the proper bones to aspire to the Dao. Thus, ice cannot be carved, and the foolish cannot become immortals—this is the principle of nature. Those whose spirit is not clear and whose bones are not towering have not been endowed with the yang numinous qi. Without this endowment, they cannot harbor the heart that yearns for immortality. If one does yearn for immortality, none fail to be born with immortal bones.\"\n\nAsked again: \"Then can one with immortal bones who does not cultivate still attain it?\"\n\nReplied: \"To have bones yet not cultivate is like having material but no craftsman. Gold hidden in ore, if not smelted, remains stone. The Dao within a person, if not refined, remains common. Though one may lack bones and not become immortal, one cannot rely on bones alone to await effortless ascension.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Harmonizing Being with Non-Being**\nSomeone asked: \"The Dao is fundamentally formless, yet immortals value having form. To harmonize being with non-being—how can this principle endure long? Would it not be more wondrous to attain nature while shedding form?\"\n\nThe reply: \"The Dao is supremely empty and boundless, yet it contains spirit and moves qi, generating being from non-being. Thus, the vast and obscure void is the formless form of the Great Dao. Heaven and earth, sun and moon are the formed forms of the Great Dao. By non-being linking being, and being uniting with non-being, the cosmos endures forever, and immortals and sages never perish.\n\n\"Life is the great virtue of heaven and earth. It is because we possess form that we perceive the vastness of the six directions and the brilliance of the three luminaries. If one were to dissolve entirely into transformation, then heaven, earth, and the myriad things would no longer be one’s own—thus, death is the bitterest poison of human relations.\n\n\"Therefore, refining the common to become immortal, refining the immortal to become perfected, refining the perfected to unite with the subtle, uniting with the subtle to merge with spirit, and spirit merging with the Dao—then the Dao becomes one’s body. Thus, one ascends to the Jade Capital, roams the Golden Gates, can be or not be, neither ending nor perishing. How can this principle not endure long?\n\n\"Those who regard attaining nature alone as wondrous, unaware of the necessity of refining form, are but clear and spirited ghosts—how can they compare to lofty immortals?\"\n\nAsked again: \"Yet immortals existed in ancient times—why, once hidden, are they no longer seen?\"\n\nReplied: \"The pure and the turbid flow in separate streams; the true and the common dwell in different realms.

His nature was lofty and pure, refusing to align with common customs. Thus, he entered Mount Song, becoming a Daoist under Master Pan Shizheng of the Body of the Mysterious, and transmitted the Orthodox Unity teachings. Through diligent study and reverent inquiry, he fully grasped its arts.\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, he journeyed south to Jinling, seeking the Dao on Mount Mao, and later traveled east to Tiantai. Wu Jun was particularly skilled in writing; while in Ke and Yue, he gathered with literati for poetic and wine-filled gatherings, and his compositions circulated in the capital. Emperor Xuanzong, hearing of his reputation, dispatched an envoy to summon him. Upon arrival, the emperor was greatly pleased by their conversation and appointed him to await imperial commands in the Hanlin Academy. The emperor inquired about Daoist methods.\n\nWu Jun replied: \"The essence of Daoist methods is found in no text more perfect than the *Five Thousand Characters*. All other verbose and branching discourses are but a waste of paper and ink.\"\n\nThe emperor further asked about the cultivation of immortals and alchemical refinement.\n\nWu Jun answered: \"These are the concerns of rustics, to be pursued through years of practice and merit. They are not matters for a sovereign to indulge in.\"\n\nWhenever he sat among Daoists and Buddhist monks, or when court ministers presented memorials, Wu Jun’s remarks pertained solely to the teachings of names and the affairs of the world. When questioned, he would respond with subtle verses to convey his sincerity. Emperor Xuanzong held him in deep esteem.\n\nDuring the Tianbao era, as Li Linfu and Yang Guozhong wielded power, the moral order of the court daily eroded. Wu Jun, foreseeing the coming chaos, persistently requested to return to Mount Song, but his petitions were repeatedly denied. Instead, the emperor decreed the establishment of a separate Daoist abbey at the mountain’s temple. When An Lushan’s rebellion loomed, Wu Jun sought to return to Mount Mao, and this time his request was granted. Soon after, the Central Plains descended into turmoil, and bandits multiplied in the Jiangnan region. He then traveled to Kuaiji, frequently journeying between Tiantai and Ke.
