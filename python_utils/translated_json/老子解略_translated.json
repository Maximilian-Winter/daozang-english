  "full_translation": "**Excerpts from *A Brief Explanation of the Laozi***\n*(By Yuan Xingzong of the Song Dynasty, from *Siku Quanshu*, *Jibu*, *Bieji*, *Jiuhua Ji*, Volume 23)*\n\n---\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\nEarth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows spontaneity—this is the form of the formless.\nTo seek to describe it is already to err.\nThus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, and spontaneity is the ultimate, the absolute.\nBefore there were things, there was nothing; then, in an instant, things arose.\nOnce things exist, they can be named, yet though they may be named as \"being,\" they cannot yet be called \"the many.\"\nThus, the named becomes the mother of the myriad things.\n\n**Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.**\nThe worthy are the instruments of the state.\nIf the worthy are not employed, the state will be diminished in great matters and weakened in small—how can this be acceptable?\nYet how could it be otherwise?\nThe sage can govern the world through the worthy but cannot make the world value worthiness.\nTo govern through the worthy is to employ them; to not make the world value worthiness is to not exalt them.\nFor exaltation is the root of contention and the origin of deceit.\n\n**Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from becoming thieves.**\nWhen gold and jade fill the halls, none can guard them.\nThus, rare goods are not prized.\nI favor stillness, and the people naturally return to simplicity; therefore, they do not become thieves.\n\n**I do not know whose child it is—it resembles the ancestor of the Emperor.**\nBefore the One and Three had taken form, there was still the One in its unshaped state—I do not know whose child it is.\nWhen things arise, they take shape, and I model them accordingly; the Emperor emerges from *Zhen* (Thunder), and I thus name it \"Emperor.\"\nYet in its beginning, it was vast and silent, and I could not name it.\nI call it \"Dao\" and, by force, name it \"Great\"—that is all.\n\n**Much speech leads to exhaustion.**\nExcessive words are superfluous, for they are untimely.\nSpeak only when the time is right, and people will not weary of your words—thus, they will not be exhausted.\n\n**Heaven is enduring, Earth is lasting.**\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, they are not free from form and measure, so their endurance is limited.\nYet Laozi speaks of \"enduring\" and \"lasting\" only up to Heaven and Earth, for he speaks of what is visible.\nAs for the ultimate in endurance, it is what is called the \"beginning of Heaven and Earth\"—this is it.\n\n**The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they do not live for themselves, and thus they can live long.**\nSome ask: \"If Heaven and Earth do not live for themselves, then who gives them life? Is this not absurd?\"\nI say: This is the subtlety of Laozi’s teaching, for he speaks metaphorically.\nHumans live *for* life, and because life is so abundant, they are ultimately burdened by it.\nFree from the burden of life, they do not live for themselves—this is the Way of non-perishing.\nIt is merely a metaphor.\n\n**My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would I have?**\nThe sage lodges me—lodges me in things.\nLodged in things, there are no boundaries; without boundaries, there is no mind.\nWhen it reaches the point of no-mind, who can say whether things are me or I am things?\nThis is called \"no-self.\"\nNo-self is the ultimate in forgetting the body.\nForgetting the body, there are no desires, no entrances, no poisons—what affliction could accumulate?\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had begun to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I was no longer myself.\"\nIf Yan Hui, though employed, was still truly himself, he still had a body.\nNow, having never been himself, he has forgotten his body.\nThus, while others cannot bear their sorrows, Yan Hui does not alter his joy.\nThis is called \"no affliction.\"\n\n**Look at it and it cannot be seen—it is called \"subtle\";**\n**Listen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called \"rare\";**\n**Grasp it and it cannot be held—it is called \"minute.\"**\nWhat I see is what everyone sees.\nThe vision of Li Lou must see what others cannot, yet can his vision surpass this? This is called \"subtle.\"\nWhat I hear is what everyone hears.\nThe hearing of Shi Kuang must hear what others cannot, yet can his hearing be singular? This is called \"rare.\"\nPeople vie to grasp what Wu Huo grasps, yet nothing is seized.\nThough Wu Huo grasps it, he truly obtains nothing—this is the real grasp. This is called \"minute.\"\nThus, the Dao cannot be heard, cannot be seen, cannot be seized.\nTherefore, look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; grasp it and it cannot be held.\n\n**The ancients who were good at being scholars were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating.**\nThe so-called \"scholar\" is one who serves the Dao.\n\"Subtle\" is the heart of the Dao;\n\"wondrous\" is the utmost of subtlety;\n\"profound\" is the gateway to wonder;\n\"penetrating\" is the function of profundity.\nIts coming has no trace; its going leaves no mark. It retreats and hides in secrecy.\nThis is true understanding—thus, it cannot be known.\n\nThe all-embracing is impartial—\nwhen nothing is not embraced, self and other merge.\nWhen self and other merge within, how can there be partiality?\n\nVast indeed, it knows no bounds—\nyet when one marks its corners, one centers it.\nMy Dao is utterly great, thus it has no gate, no sides;\nits radiance extends in all four directions—why must it be centered?\n\nThe multitude bustle and rejoice,\nas if feasting on grand sacrifice, as if ascending the spring terrace.\nYet the multitude merely savor the grand sacrifice—they do not savor the flavorless.\nThey wander the spring terrace—they do not wander the ultimate wandering.\nThus, in the end, they find no flavor; in the end, they do not wander—\nfor they know the ultimate flavor, the ultimate wandering.\n\nThe true person who fills their belly\nfinds blandness in the flavorless.\nThe true person who wanders without limit\nsees what cannot be seen.\n\nThe crooked is preserved—\na tree’s gnarled knots, its branches hollow and brittle,\nunfit for the craftsman’s use, unfit for the woodsman’s firewood,\nthus it fulfills its natural span alone.\nThe crooked is preserved—this is the effect.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Straight trees are felled first.\"*\nThe bent becomes straight.\n\nWhen a sister-in-law drowns and one reaches to save her—is this bending? It is called straightness: what is bent becomes straight. When a father steals a sheep and his son testifies against him—is this straightness? It is called bending: what is straight becomes bent.\n\nThe hollow becomes full—\nonly because it is hollow does it receive and become full.\n\nThe worn becomes new—\nstripped, it is renewed in sequence;\ncorrupted, it is restored in sequence;\ntrapped in water, it is freed by fire in sequence;\nobstructed, it is resolved in succession;\nhaving crossed, it ends in the uncrossed.\n\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning;\ntorrential rains do not last the day.\nHow could this be true of these alone?\nThe sun waxes and then wanes;\nthe moon fills and then wanes;\nhills shift into valleys;\nearth is exhausted and water flows.\nThus the sage constantly excels at saving others—\ntherefore, none are cast aside.\n\nSome say: *\"‘Constantly excels at saving others—therefore, none are cast aside.’ The noble person can indeed be saved, but what of the petty person? How can they be saved?\"*\nIt is not as you suppose.\nTo measure others by the sage’s standard is to see them as the multitude;\nto measure others by human standards is to see them as sages.\nThe small is perfected in smallness; the great is perfected in greatness.\nLike grasses and trees, each is distinct in its kind.\nThus, to save the noble person is to teach them the Dao so they love others;\nto save the petty person is to teach them the Dao so they are easier to employ.\nThis is what is meant by \"none are cast aside.\"\n\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine—\nbecome the world’s valley.\nThe *Classic* says: *\"The world’s intercourse is the world’s femininity.\"*\nIn intercourse, all return to receive it—\nthus it is called the valley.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it—\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe affairs of Tang and Wu are examples.\nTo act is to fail;\nto grasp is to lose.\n\nThose of old who took the world did so by non-action.\nWhen they acted, it was insufficient to take the world.\nOne who assists a ruler through the Dao does not dominate the world with arms.\nArms are instruments of misfortune;\nwar is a violation of virtue;\nthose who delight in killing engage in inauspicious affairs.\nWielding instruments of misfortune, practicing violations of virtue, testing inauspicious affairs—\none of the Dao does not dwell in these.\nConfucius said: *\"I have not studied the affairs of armies.\"*\nMencius said: *\"Why resort to war?\"*\nSuch deeds rebound upon their doers.\n\nWhat issues from you returns to you.\nThose who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world.\nMencius said: *\"Only those who do not delight in killing can unify it.\"*\nTo not lose one’s place is to endure.\nYan’s son—was he not close to it?\nNot shifting anger, not repeating faults, never deviating all day—\nhe did not lose his place.\nYet to not deviate from humaneness for three months—\nhow long it is!\nThose who die yet do not perish live long.\nThings grow strong, then age—\nto age is to be without the Dao.\nO my master!\nO my master!\nTo endure through ten thousand ages and not be called long-lived—\ncould it be that he has died?\nIt is said: *\"Though he has died, there is that by which he does not perish.\"*\n\nThe great Dao overflows, and it may be employed to left or right.\nThere is nothing it cannot be used for, thus it may be employed to left or right.\nThe Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, insipid in its tastelessness.\nTravelers stop for its bait.\nThe Dao is bland in its tastelessness—what profit do travelers find in it?\nThus, to savor tastelessness is the solitude of the true person.\n\nSoftness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\nOnly the softness of the world suffices to gallop through the world’s utmost hardness.\nWhen the evergreen pine was old, it said to its disciples:\n*\"Is my tongue still here?\"*\nThey said: *\"It is.\"*\n*\"Are my teeth still here?\"*\nThey said: *\"They are gone.\"*\nIt said: *\"Teeth are gone because of their hardness; the tongue remains because of its softness.\"*\nThis is the effect of softness and weakness overcoming hardness and strength.\n\nFish cannot be removed from the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others.\nThe tradition says: *\"To monopolize the state is called kingly; to control benefit and harm is called kingly.\"*\nYet if one models oneself upon it and grasps it, the kingly name is diminished.\nThus, when a king displays his instruments to others, others join together to steal his instruments.\nWhen instruments are stolen, the name shifts—\nthere is no state that cannot be lost.\nThus, those who dwell in Qi hear of Qi’s Tian clan, but do not hear of its king.\nThose who dwell in Qin hear of Qin’s Marquis Rang, but do not hear of its king.\nThis is the fault of displaying sharp instruments to others.\nThe *Yi* says: *\"Losing one’s axe.\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\n\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nlords and kings attained the One to become the steadfast pole of the world.\nTheir attainment was one and the same.\n\nIf Heaven had nothing by which to become clear, it would fear rending;\nif Earth had nothing by which to become tranquil, it would fear eruption;\nif spirits had nothing by which to become numinous, they would fear exhaustion;\nif valleys had nothing by which to become full, they would fear depletion;\nif the myriad things had nothing by which to come to life, they would fear annihilation;\nif lords and kings had nothing by which to become the steadfast pole and thus exalted themselves on high, they would fear downfall.\n\nThe meaning of the One is difficult to know.\nHow great is the significance of the One in its time!\nThat the sages reached this point—\nI cannot fathom it.\nNow, following my own thoughts to its depths:\nthe meaning of the One—is it not like water?\nWater in truth makes no distinction between east and west,\nyet water has never failed to distinguish east and west.\nThough the One does not seek to bring about its efficacy,\nits efficacy has never been apart from the One.\n\nWater’s guidance is vast and surging,\nrushing forth in all four directions,\nthereby becoming rivers and streams, the sea,\nflowing into ditches and channels.\nYet water’s constancy remains unchanged—\nthis is the effect of the One.\n\nWhen the noble person seeks to attain the One,\ncultivating the self is how one exhausts principle;\nexhausting principle is how one fulfills one’s nature.\nTo fulfill one’s nature is the utmost of sincerity.\nWhen sincerity reaches its utmost,\nthe One reaches its utmost.\nAttaining the One, then the myriad things have never failed to attain unity.\n\nThe tradition says:\n*\"Whether unified or not, it is one.\"*\nThe sage must have some means to thread this through.\nThis is how one exhausts the efficacy of the One.\nWhen the efficacy of the One is exhausted,\nthere is nothing in the world that does not know the One;\nwhen the One is not attained,\nthere is nothing in the world that could know it.\n\nObtaining it in darkness,\nemploying it in brightness—\nby this one knows the causes of the hidden and manifest,\nunderstands the theories of life and death,\nand comprehends the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\nPermeating Heaven as Heaven,\npermeating Earth as Earth.\n\nAlas!\nHow could this be the work of external imposition?\nThe noble person, knowing the greatness of the One,\nfinds no room for words.\n\nBefore yin and yang divided, it was called the One;\nwhen the Dao first arose, it was called the One.\nThese cannot be named as one alone.\nThe sage provisionally lodges the One here,\nexhausting its efficacy through the ten thousand transformations.\n\nThus:\nHeaven attained it and became clear;\nEarth attained it and became tranquil;\nspirits attained it and became numinous;\nvalleys attained it and became full;\nthe myriad things attained it and came to life;\nlords and kings attained it to become the steadfast pole of the world—\nthrough their attainment of the One.\nWithout this,\nsome would rend,\nsome would erupt,\nsome would exhaust,\nsome would annihilate,\nsome would fall.\n\nMaster Zisi said:\n*\"From sincerity to illumination is called nature;\nfrom illumination to sincerity is called teaching.\"*\nThe beginning of sincerity and illumination is not a different vessel.\nMaster Zisi’s center held the One—\nit was not externally imposed.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"I have one thing that threads it all through.\"*\nWhat the Master had to thread it through—\nthese are all matters difficult to speak of.\n\nThe classic says:\n*\"Embrace the One as the model for the world.\"*\nThat \"embracing\" of the One—\nit does not shift with the world.\n\nAlas!\nTracing back to the origins of Kong and Lao’s self-attainment—\nwere they not streams converging from different sources?\nYet the various scholars, following their currents,\npoint to Kong and Lao as distinct.\nWere the roots of Kong and Lao different?\nThey were not.\nYet the Laoist school speaks exclusively in terms of form,\nwhile the Confucian school speaks exclusively in terms of vessel.\n\nThe Confucians proceed from vessel to reach form,\nultimately entering into form;\nthe Laoists proceed from form to reach vessel,\nseeking not to be confined by vessel.\nThis is the distinction between Kong and Lao in their beginning and end, attaining the One.\n\nThe tradition says:\n*\"When one is thorough in the One, the myriad things are complete.\"*\nWhat do those various scholars know of this?\n\n*\"Reversion is the movement of the Dao—\nhow true!\"*\n\nThe Dao is emptiness—\nemptiness is clarity,\nclarity is spirit.\nSpirit is the wondrous functioning of the myriad things.\n\nTurning inward to achieve sincerity—\nis this not so?\nThis is my Dao,\nwhat is called *\"the ultimate in movement.\"*\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Refining it ever more refined,\none returns to serve Heaven.\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao;\nstiffness and strength belong to the cohort of death.\nHow could the cohort of death partake in the great Dao?\nThus, without weakness, one cannot employ the Dao.\n\nThe myriad things of the world are born from Being,\nBeing is born from Nonbeing.\nTo penetrate to the source of things—\nthis is the Dao of Being and Nonbeing.\n\nIn the beginning, there was Nonbeing;\nsuddenly there was qi,\nand with qi came form,\nform transformed to give life,\nlife transformed to give things—\nthis is the mutual succession of the four seasons.\n\nI can reverse the Dao’s course:\nby moving weakly and employing the Dao,\none forgets things;\nforgetting things, there is no life;\nwithout life, there is no form or qi.\nThus, the myriad things of the world are born from Being,\nBeing is born from Nonbeing.\n\n*\"The bright Dao seems dim\"*\nThe essence of the ultimate Dao is profound and obscure;\nits utmost limit is dark and silent.\nThis is the form of the formless—\nhence it seems dim.\n\n*\"Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat\"*\nThe multitude takes advancement as retreat—\nMencius says:\n*\"Their advance is sharp, their retreat swift.\"*\nThis is it.\nYan Yuan took retreat as advancement—\nConfucius says:\n*\"All day without contradiction, as if stupid.\"*\nThis is it.\n\n*\"The level Dao seems uneven\"*\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Using the uneven to level the level.\"*\nThus, it seems uneven.\n\n*\"Supreme virtue seems like a valley\"*\nA valley attains the One and becomes full;\nthe sage attains the One and reaches the virtue of utmost virtue.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nwith harmonizing qi as their union.\nGuliangzi says:\n*\"Neither yin alone nor yang alone can generate;\nonly their triune union brings life.\"*\nThis triune union is yin, yang, and harmonizing qi.\nOne, three, five, seven embrace yang;\ntwo, four, six, eight bear yin.\nWithout five, there is no four;\nwithout completeness, there is no establishment.\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five.\nFive governs all:\nthe spleen attains five to harmonize the organs;\nsound attains five to harmonize music;\nflavor attains five to harmonize things.\nHarmonizing qi is the thread—\nthus, their harmony.\nTherefore, the myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nwith harmonizing qi as their union.\n\nThe softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest.\nOnly by not contending does nothing under Heaven contend with it.\n\nWhich is harmful—gain or loss?\nThe multitude says:\n*\"This is gain, this is loss.\"*\nThe true person says:\n*\"Loss is also gain, gain is also loss.\"*\nThus, neither diminishes nor augments true gain.\nWhich is harmful—gain or loss?\n\n*\"Much hoarding invites great loss\"*\nMencius says:\n*\"Those who treasure pearls and jade bring calamity upon themselves.\"*\n\nIn learning, one daily accumulates;\nin cultivating the Dao, one daily diminishes.\nDiminish and further diminish,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\n\nLearning can be learned, but not attained;\nthe Dao can be attained, but not learned.\nSince it cannot be attained,\npeople do not know who or what—\nbetter to turn inward and align oneself.\nTurning inward and aligning,\none daily diminishes.\nDiminish and further diminish,\nuntil one reaches the utmost alignment.\nThus, one arrives at non-action.\nOnly by reaching non-action\ndoes one attain what is naturally attained.\nThen, there is no thought, no action.\nResponding, one penetrates the causes of all under Heaven—\nis this not *\"non-action yet nothing left undone\"*?\n\nTherefore, those who gain the world always do so through non-affair;\nwhen they engage in affairs,\nthey are insufficient to gain the world.\n\nThe accumulation of cold and heat makes winter and summer.\nPeople discuss summer, saying:\n*\"Why is its heat so violent?\"*\nThey discuss winter, saying:\n*\"Why is its cold so biting?\"*\nThey do not consider that cold and heat,\nalternating between uselessness and usefulness,\nconstitute the great winter and great summer.\nThus, confining cold and heat to usefulness\nis insufficient to make winter and summer;\nseizing the world through affairs\nis insufficient to gain the world.\n\n*\"The good I treat as good;\nthe not-good I also treat as good.\"*\nPeople enslave things,\nand things affirm this—\nhence, they affirm the affirmed.\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"How is it not so?\nNot affirming the not-affirmed.\"*\nThis must be due to something external overriding them—\nhence, there is a way to not affirm.\nYet, things inherently have what they affirm,\ninherently have what they approve.\nIf things do not bind me,\nthen I have a way to equalize them;\nif I have a way to equalize them,\nthen nothing is not affirmed, nothing is not approved.\nThus, it is said:\n*\"The good I treat as good;\nthe not-good I also treat as good.\"*\n\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them,\nthings give them form,\npotency completes them.\nThe Dao is the mother of the myriad things;\nvirtue is the radiance of the Dao;\nthings are the vessels of virtue;\npotency is the principle of things.\nIts mother can give birth to its radiance,\ncan nourish its vessels,\ncan shape its principles,\ncan bring them to completion.\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the mother of the world.\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"There is a beginning,\nand there is what precedes even the beginning.\"*\nWhat precedes the beginning is nameless.\nOnce the world has a beginning,\nthere are names.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The named is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\nThus, the world’s beginning\nserves as the mother of the world.\n\nHaving attained the mother,\none knows her children.\nThe common people all fixate on their senses,\nwhile the sage treats all as infants.\n\nHaving known the children,\none returns to guard the mother.\nIf the mother loses her children,\nor the children lose their mother,\nthe world’s Dao is lost.\nWhen the world’s Dao is lost,\nwhat is to be done?\nIt reverts.\nThus, how am I different from others?\nI value seeking sustenance from the mother.\n\nTo end one’s days without peril—\nknowing mother and child suffices.\nWhat does *\"to end one’s days without peril\"* mean?\nIt means there is no ground for death.\nBlock the apertures, shut the gates,\nand one labors not for a lifetime;\nopen the apertures, advance one’s affairs,\nand one cannot be saved for a lifetime.\n*Apertures* (兑) are joy—\nwhat enters from without.\nThus the true person blocks them.\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Open heaven’s heaven, not man’s heaven.\"*\nThis is to block the apertures and shut the gates.\nTo *\"open man’s heaven, not heaven’s heaven\"*\nis to open the apertures and advance one’s affairs.\nOpening heaven’s [way] gives rise to virtue,\nthus one labors not for a lifetime.\nOpening man’s [way] harms life,\nthus one cannot be saved for a lifetime.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity.\nKing Zhou made ivory chopsticks,\nand Jizi grew fearful;\nChu did not prepare sweet wine,\nand Musheng departed;\nZhao killed Mingdu,\nand Confucius met no favor.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To see the small is called clarity.\"*\n\nTo guard softness is called strength.\nTang was imprisoned at Xatai,\nand the Xia collapsed;\nKing Wen was imprisoned at Youli,\nand the Shang was destroyed;\nGoujian groomed horses for Wu,\nand after ten generations Yue endured.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To guard softness is called strength.\"*\n\nDescendants continue sacrifices without cease.\n\nLiu Zizheng said: *\"When the noble person preserves their spirit, good fortune extends to their descendants.\"*\n\nCultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true;\ncultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring;\ncultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful;\ncultivate it in the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nThe Record states: *\"Those in antiquity who wished to illumine their luminous virtue throughout the world first governed their states; wishing to govern their states, they first harmonized their families; wishing to harmonize their families, they first cultivated their selves; wishing to cultivate their selves, they first rectified their hearts.\"*\n\nNow, to well establish and well embrace is to rectify the heart. Thus:\ncultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true;\nharmonize the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate the village to govern the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful;\nfinally illumine luminous virtue throughout the world, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nOne whose accumulated virtue is profound is comparable to an infant.\nWhen the spirit within is tranquil, the harmony of heaven is firm;\nwhen the harmony of heaven is firm, one preserves the thread of emptiness—\nthis is the guarding of pure *qi*.\n\nThus it is said: *\"One whose accumulated virtue is profound is comparable to an infant.\"*\nThe Classic states: *\"Can you be like a newborn babe?\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"Can you be like a little child?\"*\nThis is what it means.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting them,\nfierce beasts do not seize them,\ngrasping birds do not strike them.\n\nPreserving the thread of emptiness, one’s movement and stillness become spirit-like.\nWhen movement and stillness possess spirit, transformation and change follow constancy, and the myriad things are mastered.\nAlas! Is this not the work of spirit?\n\nThus the rhinoceros has no use for its horn—this is what is meant by *\"poisonous creatures do not sting\"*;\nthe tiger has no place to set its claws—this is what is meant by *\"fierce beasts do not seize\"*;\nhumans and beasts do not disrupt the herd—this is what is meant by *\"grasping birds do not strike.\"*\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nFish wish to rest in the pot; governance wishes to rest in the state.\nIf the fish is constantly disturbed in the pot, there will be no whole fish;\nif governance is constantly disturbed among the people, there will be no well-governed state.\nThough this saying is small, it can illustrate great truths.\n\nThose who oversee the world with the Dao—even their ghosts do not act as spirits.\nWhen the Dao oversees the world, the people all know the joy of heaven.\nZhuangzi said: *\"The people know the joy of heaven,\"* and thus there are no people to condemn and no ghosts to blame—this is why their ghosts do not act as spirits.\nIt is not that their ghosts do not act as spirits, but that their spirits do not harm people.\n\nThe tradition states: *\"The people are the masters of the spirits.\"*\nSpirits act in dependence upon people; when people fulfill their duties, spirits act in accordance with them.\nOne who harms their master—this has never been.\nIt is not only that their spirits do not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm people.\nWhen the two do not harm one another, their virtues converge and return.\n\n*The Explanation of the Laozi* states: *\"When the people violate the law, this is called the people harming their superiors; when superiors punish the people, this is called superiors harming the people; when the people do not violate the law and superiors do not employ punishments, this is called superiors not harming themselves.\"*\nThis is like ghosts not afflicting the people and the people not being violent toward ghosts—neither side acts with intent.\nThis is the affair of utmost virtue.\nThus, when the two do not harm one another, their virtues converge and return.\n\nA great state is like the lower reaches of a river—water flows downward without exception. This is how the Jiang and the Sea become the kings of all valleys. When people are not good, how can they be cast aside? The good, I treat with goodness; the not-good, I also treat with goodness. This is how the Old Master saves all things, correcting the world by speaking thus.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Ever skillful in saving people, there are no outcasts.\"* Plan for difficulty while it is still easy; accomplish the great while it is still small. Clarity arises from obscurity; order emerges from formlessness. As for clarity and order, I need not dispute them—it is because the dispute was not settled early.\n\nThe difficult affairs of the world must begin in the easy; the great affairs of the world must begin in the small. Therefore, when the sage wishes to rise above others, he speaks as though beneath them; when he wishes to precede others, he places himself behind them. Thus, though the sage stands above, people do not feel burdened; though he stands ahead, people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.\n\nOthers hold to their doctrines, and I hold to mine. It is not that I dare not speak my doctrine—it is that I cannot overcome their opposition. Thus, I would rather abandon my doctrine to preserve it. To abandon my doctrine and yet preserve it—this is how I have maintained my doctrine in the world. The world delights in exalting him and does not weary. Even in my conduct, it is the same.\n\nGuanzi said: *\"To rule others with superiority never wins their hearts; to humble oneself before others never fails to win them.\"* This is what is meant. The world all says my Dao is great yet seems unrefined. Precisely because it is great, it seems unrefined. The Classic states: *\"All people have their uses, but I alone am dull and coarse.\"* This is what makes it seem unrefined. What does the sage gain from this? He gains its semblance of unrefinement.\n\nThus, disputation need not be clever, erudition need not be wise—when applied, it is inexhaustible. What manner of person is he? What manner of person is he?\n\nThus it is said in the tradition: *\"Vague and obscure, without intent yet difficult to scheme with.\"* If it were refined, how long would it endure? How trifling it would be!\n\nThe Dao is formless, hence without resemblance. To resemble is to be confined by form—yet to confine form is not the way of form. Is this not petty?\n\nI possess three treasures, which I safeguard and uphold:\nFirst is compassion,\nsecond is frugality,\nthird is not daring to take the lead in the world.\nThese are the distinct teachings of the *Virtue Classic*, what the Old Master embodied in practice.\n\nThe essence of compassion is benevolent virtue;\nthe essence of frugality is obscure virtue;\nthe essence of not daring to take the lead is humble virtue.\n\nCompassion thus enables courage. There was a governance of unyielding kindness—King Wen’s compassion. When the king’s wrath blazed forth, he ultimately responded to the world. Hence it is said: *\"The benevolent are surely courageous.\"*\n\nNot daring to take the lead in the world thus enables one to become the vessel’s elder. The world’s great vessel cannot be made—those who make it ruin it. I do not strive, nor am I enslaved to this vessel, and so I become its elder. This is what is meant by *\"putting oneself last yet coming first.\"*\n\nThose who are skilled at overcoming enemies do not contend. The *Book of Changes*’ *\"Army\"* states: *\"Water within the earth—an army.\"* An army is rectified by the many. Water benefits all things yet does not contend—this is the highest skill in overcoming enemies.\n\nThose who are skilled at employing others place themselves below them. Mencius said: *\"By rank, you are the lord and I the minister; by virtue, you serve me.\"* How dare I compare with them? Thus, Tang’s minister Yi Yin, King Wen’s minister Hong Yao, King Wu’s minister the Duke of Zhou, and Duke Huan’s minister Guan Zhong—though they placed themselves below, they received the mandate. How could they deign otherwise?\n\nIn later ages, none were not lords, yet they could not employ ministers; none were not ministers, yet they did not serve their lords. This arises from nothing else: lords favor ministers for the mandate they receive, not for the way by which they receive it. This is called *\"the virtue of non-contention.\"*\n\nThe tradition states: *\"Contention is the least of affairs.\"* Thus, the Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at overcoming; the sage’s Way is non-action yet does not contend. Now, when what is called *\"virtue\"* emerges, the Dao recedes—this is virtue’s doing.\n\nThis is called *\"employing the strength of others.\"* I practice non-action and employ the world—who in the world would not be employed by me? It is by employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called *\"matching Heaven, the ancient utmost.\"* Yao asked Xu You: *\"Can Nie Que match Heaven?\"* Xu You replied: *\"He exalts knowledge and races like fire—he is but a thread, merely transforming with things. How could he match Heaven? Yet one who does not compete or contend, who skillfully employs others—this is how to match Heaven to the utmost.\"*\n\nThere is a saying in warfare: *\"I dare not act as host but only as guest.\"* Dare one call this excessive timidity? It is said: *\"What words are these? The noble person only knows how to place himself below others—thus he is seen as below others.\"* Is this not the meaning of the *Book of Changes*’ *\"Army\"*?\n\nIn *\"Army,\"* the sixth line of the third hexagram states: *\"Perhaps bearing corpses in a chariot—misfortune.\"* Yin riding over yang is the fault of rigidity. Advancing without achievement is a punishment that does not fit the crime—this is the error of acting as host rather than guest.\n\nIn *\"Army,\"* the sixth line of the fifth hexagram states: *\"There are birds in the field; it is beneficial to seize them—no blame.\"* The soft occupying the hard’s position does not dare to lead. Going forth and capturing prey brings advantage—this is the principle of acting as guest rather than host.\n\nThus, the harm of acting as host in warfare is like this! Hence it is said: *\"I dare not.\"*\n\n*\"To repel without arms.\"*\n\n\"Only through endurance can one achieve success.\n*Cast aside the unmatched.*\n\nIt is precisely by not contending that none in the world can contend with one’s ability, none in the world can contend with one’s merit.\n*Grasp no weapon.*\n\nWithout weapons, there is no attack—why then engage in battle? It is said: The highest warfare is fought without action; the imperial warfare is fought with virtue; the kingly warfare is fought with righteousness—what need is there to grasp weapons?\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nTo underestimate the enemy is to nearly forfeit one’s treasure.\nWeapons are inauspicious instruments.\nTo observe them is to toy with them; to toy with them is to grow arrogant; to grow arrogant is to lack resilience.\nThus, no misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy.\nWithout resilience, there is defeat; defeat leads to weakness; weakness leads to chaos and ruin in succession.\nThus, to underestimate the enemy is to nearly forfeit one’s treasure.\n\nTherefore, when opposing armies clash, the grieving side prevails.\nThe humane possess a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others—they do not delight in killing but use killing to halt killing.\nThus, when opposing armies clash, to say to others, *'I am skilled in formation, I am skilled in battle,'* is a grave transgression.\nThe grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\nThe Great Dao is utterly level.\n*Level* is to say *easy.*\nThus, the Dao is the most level of things and the most simple of instruments.\nLevel, then easy to know; simple, then easy to practice.\nHence it is said: *'My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.'*\nEven the ignorance of common men and women may grasp them;\neven the unworthiness of common men and women may practice them.\nAt first, they stand resolute; in the end, they vanish abruptly—this is not the fault of common men and women.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long days; thus, none in the world can know, none can practice.\n\nIt is only due to their lack of knowledge that they do not know me.\nThe sage observes the spirit without entanglement;\nemerges from the multitude without scheming.\nThus, the mind listens to qi, qi listens to the spirit, the spirit listens to the Dao.\nIn its emergence and its return, none can comprehend it.\nThis is true knowledge.\nThey do not know it—thus, they do not know me.\n\nYet though they do not know me, what affliction is it to me?\nZhuangzi said: If they call me a horse, I too shall be a horse;\nif they call me an ox, I too shall be an ox.\nDo they know me?\nOr do they not?\"\n\nThus, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.\nThe hide of a patterned leopard—its markings gleam;\nthe words of a refined scholar—their elegance flourishes.\nYet when elegance flourishes, the world lacks whole scholars;\nwhen markings gleam, the wilds lack unblemished leopards.\nMust I grieve for these two? How might they escape such fate?\nIt is said: Perilous indeed—such adornment becomes their disaster.\nTherefore, the sage appears as a dragon yet dwells in stillness,\nsweeps away his shadow and erases his tracks—does he not shun the display of worth?\nThis is called \"wearing coarse cloth while holding jade within.\"\n\nTo know what one does not know—this is excellence.\nNot to feign knowledge of what one does not know—this is true knowledge.\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in restraint leads to life.\nTo charge like a tiger or ford a river—these are acts of daring boldness.\nTo die without regret is only enough to destroy one’s body.\nNot to stand beneath a crumbling wall—this is boldness in restraint.\nFearing harm to one’s true destiny is only enough to preserve one’s life.\n\nThe people do not fear death—why threaten them with it?\nThis is the lament of the Old Master, a sigh for the times.\nWhen those above lose the Dao, they esteem cunning schemes;\nwhen they esteem cunning schemes, strict oversight follows;\nwhen strict oversight follows, the people grow desperate and lightly transgress the law.\nThus, the executed lie heaped upon one another—how then could they fear death?\nAbandon cunning schemes, and there will be no strict oversight;\nwithout strict oversight, reverence for clarity and stillness arises;\nwith reverence for clarity and stillness, the people settle themselves and commit no crimes.\nHow much less would they fear death?\n\nIf the people truly feared death, and I seized and executed those who act strangely, who would dare?\nYet the people do fear death, and still there are those who act strangely—\nthis is to stir up disorder among the people.\nThus, those who disrupt the people with strangeness are like weeds that choke the sprouts.\nRemove the weeds, and the sprouts flourish;\nremove the strange, and the people are at peace.\nIf I seize and execute them—\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes; thus, they starve.\nMencius said: \"There are levies of cloth and thread, levies of grain, and levies of labor.\nIf a gentleman removes one but employs the other two, the people will starve.\"\nIf the people hold death in dread, they will not flee far.\n\nIf this is reversed, it is the fault of tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials. Some, old and weak, perish in ditches—thus the people hold death lightly. The strong scatter to the four directions—thus the people hold migration lightly. Though there be boats and carriages, none ride them. Mountains lack paths and tunnels; marshes lack boats and bridges—such is an age of utmost virtue.\n\nNeighboring states gaze upon one another; the sounds of chickens and dogs carry between them. Zhuangzi said: \"The myriad creatures live in flocks, bound to their native land.\" Thus, neighboring states gaze upon one another, and beasts gather in herds—hence the sounds of chickens and dogs carry between them.\n\nTruthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful.\nThe Dao is not questioned; questions receive no answer. The good do not dispute.\nTo question what cannot be questioned is endless.\nTo answer what cannot be answered is hollow.\nThus, those who dispute are not good.\n\n*Collected Writings of Jiuhua, Volume 23*\n*Explanations of the Laozi* *[Original Text]*\n*Laozi Jielüe from the Siku Quanshu Jiuhua Ji*\n*(Song Dynasty) Yuan Xingzong*\n\n---\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\nEarth follows Heaven; Heaven follows the Dao; the Dao follows nature—this is the form of the formless. If one desires to shape it, one errs. Thus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Nature is the utmost, the ultimate. For before things arose, there was nothing. Suddenly, things came to be; once there are things, they can be named. Yet though things can be named, they cannot be named as mere multiplicity. Thus, the named becomes the mother of the myriad things.\n\n\"Not to esteem the worthy prevents the people from contending.\"\nThe worthy are the state’s instruments. If the worthy are not employed, the state will diminish if great, weaken if small. Can one do without them? How could one? The sage can govern the world with the worthy but cannot exalt the worthy to govern the world. To govern the world with the worthy is to employ them; to exalt the worthy to govern the world is not to esteem them. For esteem is the root of contention and the source of deceit.\n\n\"Not to prize rare goods prevents the people from stealing.\"\nGold and jade fill the halls, yet none can guard them. Thus, not prizing rare goods, I value stillness, and the people naturally return to simplicity—hence they do not steal.\n\n\"I do not know whose child it is—the image of the Lord’s predecessor.\"\nBefore the One and Three began, there was still the One, though unformed. I do not know whose child it is. When things arise, they take form; I follow their form to name them. When the Lord emerges from the east, I follow the Lord to name him. Yet in its beginning, it was vast and silent—I cannot name it. I call it the Dao; I force the name \"great,\" and that is all.\n\n\"Much speech leads to exhaustion.\"\nWords in excess are untimely. Speak only in due time, and people will not tire of them—thus one does not exhaust oneself.\n\nThe heavens endure, the earth persists. Though vast, heaven and earth have not transcended form and number—thus their endurance, though great, remains measurable. Yet Laozi speaks of \"enduring and persisting\" in the utmost, referring only to what is visible. As for the ultimate endurance, it is what is called \"the beginning of heaven and earth.\" That heaven and earth endure so long is because they do not live for themselves—thus they attain long life.\n\nSome ask: If heaven and earth do not live for themselves, who then gives them life? Perhaps they arise spontaneously? This is the subtlety of Laozi’s teaching—he merely suggests as much. Humans live by the abundance of life-giving forces, and thus are ultimately burdened by life. Free from the burden of life, they do not live for themselves. This is the Way of non-perishing, merely suggested in passing.\n\nMy greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would I have? The sage’s lodging of the self is to lodge it in things. Lodged in things, there are no boundaries; without boundaries, there is no mind. When the mind is utterly absent, one does not know whether things are the self or the self is things—this is called \"no-self.\" With no-self comes the utmost forgetting of the body. Forgetting the body, there are no desires, no entrances, no poisons—what affliction could accumulate?\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I began to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I was no longer myself.\" Before there was Yan Hui, he had already forgotten his body. Thus, when others cannot bear their sorrows, Yan Hui remains unchanged in his joy—this is called \"no affliction.\"\n\nLook and it cannot be seen—call it \"subtle.\"\nListen and it cannot be heard—call it \"rare.\"\nGrasp and it cannot be held—call it \"minute.\"\nWhat I see is what the multitude sees. The vision of Li Lou must lie beyond what the multitude does not see—yet can his vision be complete? This is called \"subtle.\" What I hear is what the multitude hears. The hearing of Shi Kuang must lie beyond what the multitude does not hear—yet can his hearing be unified? This is called \"rare.\" The multitude compete in grasping—yet even Wu Huo cannot seize it. Wu Huo grasps at it, yet truly obtains nothing. This is the true grasping—called \"minute.\" Thus the Dao cannot be heard, cannot be seen, cannot be grasped. Therefore, look and it cannot be seen; listen and it cannot be heard; grasp and it cannot be held.\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, deeply unknowable. What is called a scholar is one who serves the Dao. Subtlety is the heart of the Dao; mystery is the utmost of subtlety; profundity is the gateway to mystery; penetration is the function of profundity. Its coming has no side; its going leaves no trace. Retreating, it hides in secrecy—how could it be known?\n\nOnly when one’s demeanor is impartial can it be just. Impartiality leaves nothing unembraced—thus self and other merge within. How could there be partiality?\n\nVast indeed, it has no end! It is whole in every corner, its center everywhere. My Dao is so great it has no gate, no side—radiant in all four directions, why must it have a center?\n\nThe multitude bustle about, as if feasting on grand sacrifices, as if ascending spring terraces. The multitude savor the grand feast, yet do not savor the flavorless; they wander the spring terrace, yet do not wander the ultimate wandering. Thus they end without flavor, conclude without wandering—because they know the ultimate flavor, the ultimate wandering. The true person’s filling of the belly is insipid, without flavor. The true person’s wandering is boundless—seen yet unseen.\n\nThat which is bent becomes whole. A tree’s gnarled knots and hollow ends are not chosen by the carpenter, nor gathered by the woodcutter—thus it fulfills its natural lifespan. This is the effect of \"that which is bent becomes whole.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Straight trees are the first felled.\"\n\nThat which is crooked becomes straight. If a sister-in-law is drowning and one extends a hand to save her, is this crooked? It is called straight. This is \"that which is crooked becomes straight.\" If a father steals a sheep and the son testifies against him, is this straight? It is called crooked. This is \"that which is straight becomes crooked.\"\n\nThat which is low becomes full. Only because it is low can it be filled.\n\nRagged becomes new. Peeling, it returns to sequence; decay, it faces renewal; peril, it turns to separation; adversity, it finds resolution—thus follows the succession of \"already crossed\" and \"not yet crossed,\" bringing all to completion.\n\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning; torrential rains do not last the day. How could this be true of these alone? The sun at its zenith declines; the moon at its full wanes. Hills erode into valleys; dry earth gives way to flowing water.\n\nThus the sage constantly excels at saving others, and so none are cast aside. Some say: \"Constantly excelling at saving others, none are cast aside.\" The noble person can indeed be saved—how then can the petty person be saved? It is not as you suppose. To measure others by the standard of the sage is to see them as common; to measure others by the standard of common people is to see them as sages. The small is perfected in smallness, the great in greatness—like grasses and trees, each distinct in its kind. Thus to save the noble person: let them study the Dao and love others. To save the petty person: let them study the Dao and become easy to employ. This is what is meant by \"none are cast aside.\"\n\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine—become the world’s valley. As the *Classic* says: \"The world’s intercourse, the world’s female—its intercourse is submission, and thus it receives.\" Therefore it is called the valley.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The affairs of Tang and Wu are examples of this. To act is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it. Those who took the world in ancient times did so by means of non-action; when they acted, it was insufficient to take the world.\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use weapons to overpower the world. Weapons are instruments of misfortune; war is contrary to virtue. Those who delight in killing are engaged in inauspicious affairs—those with the Dao do not dwell in such things. Confucius said: \"I have not studied the affairs of armies.\" Mencius said: \"Why resort to war?\"\n\nIts consequences return swiftly: what issues from you will rebound upon you. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world. Mencius said: \"Only those who do not delight in killing can unify it.\"\n\nThose who do not lose their place endure. Yan Hui was nearly there—never transferring anger, never repeating a mistake, never deviating from his place all day. How much more so his three months without deviating from humaneness!\n\nThose who die yet do not perish live long. Things in their prime grow old—aging is contrary to the Dao. My teacher! My teacher! You endure through ten thousand ages without being long-lived—how could you be dead? Though dead, there is that by which you do not perish.\n\nThe great Dao overflows—it may be used to the left or right. Employed, there is nothing it cannot do; thus it may be used to the left or right.\n\nThe Dao that issues from the mouth is bland, as if without flavor. Travelers stop for its bait—yet what profit lies in the Dao’s blandness, as if without flavor? Thus, to savor the flavorless is the solitude of the true person.\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong. Only the softness under heaven suffices to gallop through the utmost hardness. A venerable elder, nearing his end, said to his disciples: \"Is my tongue still here?\" They replied, \"It is.\" \"Are my teeth still here?\" They replied, \"Gone.\" \"The teeth are gone because of their hardness; the tongue remains because of its softness—such is the efficacy of the soft and weak overcoming the hard and strong.\"\n\nFish must not be taken from the depths; the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others. The tradition says: \"To monopolize the state is called kingship; to master profit and harm is called kingship; to model and hold to it is called kingship—yet the name of kingship suffers loss.\" Thus, if a king displays his instruments to others, others will join together to steal both his instruments and him. When instruments are stolen, names shift—without a state, one cannot avoid perishing. Therefore, those who dwell in Qi hear only of Qi’s Tian clan, not of its king; those who dwell in Qin hear only of Qin’s Marquis Rang, not of its king—this is the fault of showing one’s sharp instruments to others. The *Yi* says: \"Losing one’s axe of resources\"—this is what it means.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nThe spirits attained the One and became numinous;\nThe valleys attained the One and became full;\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nThe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\nTheir attainment was one and the same:\nWithout heaven’s clarity, it would fear splitting;\nWithout earth’s tranquility, it would fear erupting;\nWithout the spirits’ numinosity, it would fear fading;\nWithout the valleys’ fullness, it would fear exhausting;\nWithout the myriad things’ life, it would fear perishing;\nWithout the lords and kings’ standard, exalted and lofty, it would fear stumbling.\nThe meaning of the One is hard to know;\nThe timeliness of the One—how great it is!\n\nAlas! That the sage has reached this point—I cannot fathom it. Yet if I probe it with my mind, the meaning of the One may be likened to water. Water in truth makes no distinction between east and west, yet there is nowhere water does not divide east and west. The One, though not seeking utility, is never without utility. Water’s guidance flows vast and surging, rushing forth in all directions—thus it becomes the Yangtze, the Yellow River, the sea, or disperses into ditches and streams—yet water itself remains unchanged. Such is the efficacy of the One.\n\nThe noble person, in seeking to attain the One, cultivates the self to exhaust principle. Exhausting principle, one fully realizes one’s nature. To fully realize one’s nature is the perfection of sincerity; the perfection of sincerity is the perfection of the One. Attaining the One, the myriad things are never not unified. The *Transmission* says: \"Its oneness—oneness is its non-oneness.\" The\n\nTo gain or to lose—which brings affliction? The multitude says: \"This is gain, that is loss.\" The true person says: \"Loss is also gain, gain is also loss—this neither harms nor benefits the gain.\" To gain or to lose—which brings affliction? Hoarding much ensures heavy loss. Mencius said: \"Those who treasure pearls and jade invite calamity upon themselves.\"\n\nIn learning, one daily accumulates; in pursuing the Dao, one daily diminishes. Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action—through non-action, nothing is left undone. Learning may be learned, but the Dao cannot be attained through learning. The Dao may be attained, but not through learning. If it cannot be attained, then none can know who or what it is. Better to turn inward and align with principle. Turning inward and aligning with principle is called \"diminishing\"; diminish and further diminish, until one reaches the utmost alignment. Thus, through non-action, one attains what is naturally attained. Only then is there no thought, no action—yet responding, one penetrates the patterns of all under heaven. This is what is meant by \"through non-action, nothing is left undone.\"\n\nTherefore, those who govern all under heaven do so by non-interference; when they interfere, they are no longer capable of governing all under heaven. The accumulation of cold and heat, winter and summer—when people discuss summer, they ask: \"Why is the heat so scorching?\" When they discuss winter, they ask: \"Why is the cold so biting?\" They do not reflect that cold and heat, in their alternation, render each other useless, yet their very uselessness gives rise to their great utility. Thus, confining cold and heat to utility is insufficient to constitute true winter and summer; governing all under heaven through interference is insufficient to govern all under heaven.\n\nWhat is good, I deem good; what is not good, I also deem good. Things enslave people, and people call this \"so.\" Yet how is it not so? It is not so because it is so—this must be seized from without. Thus, there is a way to make it not so. Nevertheless, things inherently have their \"so,\" inherently have their \"permissible.\" If things do not adhere to me, then I have a way to equalize them. Having a way to equalize them, nothing is not so, nothing is not permissible. Therefore, \"What is good, I deem good; what is not good, I also deem good.\"\n\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things give them form, and circumstances bring them to completion. The Dao is the mother of the myriad things; virtue is the radiance of the Dao; things are the vessels of virtue; circumstances are the principles of things. The mother can give life, the radiance can nourish, the vessels can take form, and the principles can reach completion.\n\nAll under heaven has a beginning, which serves as the mother of all under heaven. Zhuangzi said: \"There is a beginning, and there is that which precedes the beginning—what precedes the beginning is nameless.\" All under heaven has a beginning, and thus it has a name. The *Classic* says: \"The named is the mother of the myriad things.\" Therefore, the beginning of all under heaven serves as its mother.\n\nHaving grasped the mother, one knows her children. The common people all fixate on their senses, while the sage remains like a child.\n\nHaving known the children, one must again guard the mother. If the mother loses her children or the children lose their mother, the world’s Way is lost. When the world’s Way is lost, how can one return? Thus, why should I alone be different from others? I value seeking sustenance from the mother. To the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\n\nTo know both mother and child is sufficient; to the end of one’s days, one does not perish—what does this mean? It means there is no ground for death. Block the apertures, shut the gates, and one will not toil for a lifetime. Open the apertures, further one’s affairs, and one will not be saved for a lifetime. \"Apertures\" refer to pleasure, which enters from without. Thus, the true person blocks them. Zhuangzi said: \"To open the heavens’ heaven and not open the human’s heaven is to block the apertures and shut the gates. To open the human’s heaven and not open the heavens’ heaven is to open the apertures and further one’s affairs.\" Opening the heavens gives rise to virtue, so one does not toil for a lifetime. Opening the human gives rise to harm, so one is not saved for a lifetime.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity. When King Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi feared; when Chu did not prepare sweet wine for Musheng, he departed; when Zhao killed Mingdu, Confucius did not encounter them. Thus it is said: to see the small is called clarity.\n\nTo guard the soft is called strength. Tang was imprisoned at Xatai, and the Xia perished; King Wen was imprisoned at Youli, and the Shang was destroyed; Goujian groomed horses for Wu, yet after ten generations, Yue endured. Thus it is said: to guard the soft is called strength.\n\nThat descendants may continue sacrifices without cease—Liu Zizheng said: \"When the noble person preserves their spirit, good fortune extends to their descendants.\" Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nThe *Record* says: \"In ancient times, those who wished to make their illustrious virtue shine throughout all under heaven first governed their states. Wishing to govern their states, they first harmonized their families. Wishing to harmonize their families, they first cultivated their selves. Wishing to cultivate their selves, they first rectified their hearts.\" Now, to well establish and well embrace is to rectify the heart. Thus, cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true; harmonize the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant; cultivate it in the village to govern the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful; finally, make illustrious virtue shine throughout all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nThose who contain profound virtue are comparable to an infant. When the spirit is inwardly still, the harmony of heaven is firm. When the harmony of heaven is firm, one preserves the thread of emptiness—this is the guarding of pure qi. Thus it is said: those who contain profound virtue are comparable to an infant. The *Classic* says: \"Can you be like a newborn babe?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Can you be like a little child?\" This is what is meant.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and birds of prey do not strike. Preserving the thread of emptiness, movement and stillness become spirit-like. When movement and stillness are spirit-like, transformation has constancy, and the myriad things are mastered. Alas! Is this not the work of the spirit? Thus, the rhinoceros has no use for its horn—this is what is meant by \"poisonous insects do not sting.\" The tiger has no place to set its claws—this is what is meant by \"fierce beasts do not seize.\" Humans and beasts do not disrupt their herds—this is what is meant by \"birds of prey do not strike.\"\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish. Fish wish to be at ease in the pot; governance wishes to be at ease in the state. If fish are frequently disturbed in the pot, there will be no whole fish. If governance is frequently disturbed among the people, there will be no well-governed state. Though this speaks of small things, it can illustrate great ones.\n\nWhen one attends to all under heaven with the Dao, its ghosts do not become spirits. When the Dao attends to all under heaven, the people all know the joy of heaven. Zhuangzi said: \"When the people know the joy of heaven, there are no human transgressions, no human faults, and no ghosts to blame.\" Thus, its ghosts do not become spirits.\n\nIt is not that its ghosts do not become spirits, but that their spirits do not harm people. The *Tradition* says: \"The people are the masters of ghosts and spirits.\" Spirits rely on people to act. When people are at peace in their duties, the spirits rely on them and act. To harm their master—this has never been. It is not that their spirits do not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm people. When the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge therein.\n\nThe *Explanation of the Laozi* says: \"When the people violate the law, this is called the people harming their superiors. When superiors punish the people, this is called superiors harming the people. When the people do not violate the law and superiors do not employ punishments, this is called superiors not harming. Is this not like ghosts not becoming malevolent? When the people are not violent toward ghosts, and ghosts are not violent toward the people, both are without intent—this is the work of utmost virtue. Thus, when the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge therein.\"\n\nA great state is the lower reaches. Water flows downward without exception—this is why the rivers and seas are the kings of the hundred valleys.\n\nIf people are not good, how can they be cast aside? The good I treat with goodness, and the not-good I also treat with goodness—this is how the Old Master saves all things, correcting the world by speaking thus. Therefore it is said: \"Ever skillful in saving people, there are no outcasts.\"\n\nResolve difficulties while they are still easy; accomplish great things while they are still small. What is bright and clear arises from what is dark and obscure; what has pattern arises from what is formless. Bright and clear, patterned as they are, I cannot explain them—because I did not discern them early enough to explain. The difficult affairs of the world must first appear in what is easy; the great affairs of the world must first appear in what is small. Thus the sage, wishing to be above others, speaks as though beneath them; wishing to be ahead of others, places himself behind. Therefore, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel his weight; though he stands in front, they do not feel harmed. Thus the world delights in exalting him without tiring, because he does not contend. Others cling to their doctrines, and I cling to mine—not that I dare not speak, nor that I cannot overcome opponents. Rather, I would rather set aside my doctrine to preserve it. For in setting aside my doctrine to preserve it, I have possessed, from of old, the world’s doctrine. The world delights in exalting and does not tire of it. Though I act, it is the same.\n\nGuanzi said: \"To govern others with superiority has never won people; to govern others by placing oneself below has never failed to win them.\" This is what is meant.\n\nThe world all says my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. The *Classic* says: \"The multitude all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse\"—this is what makes it seem unworthy. What does the sage gain from this? He gains its semblance of unworthiness. Therefore, to argue is not necessarily wisdom; to be learned is not necessarily intelligence. To employ it is not to exhaust it—what manner of person is he? What manner of person is he? He is what the tradition calls \"dim and obscure, without intent, difficult to plan with.\"\n\nIf it were worthy, it would have long since been petty—for it is fine indeed. The Dao has no form, thus it has no likeness. To be like is to be confined by form; this is not how to be free of form. Is this not small?\n\nI have three treasures that I hold and preserve: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. These are the distinct teachings of the *Virtue Classic*, what the Old Master personally practiced. The reality of compassion is benevolent virtue; the reality of frugality is hidden virtue; the reality of not daring to be first in the world is humble virtue.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous. The governance of one who cannot bear the suffering of others—this was King Wen’s compassion. When he burned with righteous anger, he ultimately triumphed over the world. Thus it is said: \"The benevolent must be courageous.\"\n\nNot daring to be first in the world enables one to become the vessel’s elder. The great vessel of the world cannot be made; to make it is to ruin it. I do nothing and am not enslaved, thus I become the vessel’s elder. This is what is meant by \"putting oneself last and thereby coming first.\"\n\nOne who is skillful in overcoming opponents does not contend. The *Changes* says in *The Army*: \"Within the earth there is water—*The Army*. The noble person uses the multitude with correctness.\" Water benefits the myriad things without contending—this is the greatest good in overcoming opponents.\n\nOne who is skillful in employing others places himself below them. Mencius said: \"In terms of position, you are the lord and I the minister; in terms of virtue, you should serve me. How dare I rank with you?\" Thus, Tang made Yi Yin his minister, King Wen made Hong Yao his minister, King Wu made the Duke of Zhou his minister, and Duke Huan made Guan Zhong his minister. Though they placed themselves below, they received the mandate. For they disdained not the one they served, while later generations—though none are not lords—cannot employ ministers, and none are not ministers yet cannot be employed by lords. This has no other cause: lords love the ministers they receive the mandate from, but do not love the ministers by whom they receive the mandate.\n\nThis is called the virtue of not contending.\n\nThe tradition says: \"Contention is the least of affairs.\" Thus, the Dao of Heaven does not contend yet skillfully overcomes; the Dao of the sage does nothing yet does not contend. Now, what is called virtue emerges from the Dao and enters into virtue—this is why.\n\nThis is called employing the strength of others. I do nothing yet employ the world; who in the world would not be employed by me? It is by employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nWhen Yao asked Xu You and Nie Que if they could match Heaven, he said: \"They are now exalting knowledge and rushing like fire; they are now entangled in trivialities; they are now blending with things—how could they match Heaven?\" Yet if one does not compete, does not contend, and skillfully employs others, this is matching Heaven to the utmost.\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms: \"I dare not act as host but act as guest.\"\n\nIs not daring to act as host but acting as guest too weak? It is not so. The noble person only knows how to place himself below others, thus he is seen as below others. Is this not what is meant in the *Changes* by *The Army*? In *The Army*, the third six says: \"Some carry corpses in their chariots—misfortune.\" This is the fault of the yin riding the yang, the hard. Advancing achieves nothing; the fault is not fitting. This is the error of acting as host, not as guest. In *The Army*, the fifth six says: \"There are birds in the field; it is beneficial to capture them—no blame.\" Being soft in a hard position, he does not dare to lead. Going forth, he captures the birds—this is the meaning of acting as guest, not as host. Thus, the harm of acting as host in the use of arms is like this. Therefore it is said: \"I dare not.\"\n\nTo seize without arms—\nOne must be patient, then there will be success.\n\nTo cast aside arms is to have no enemy—only by not contending does none in the world contend with him; only by not contending does none in the world contend for merit. To grasp no weapon is to have no war—without arms, what is there to strike? Why speak of battle? The highest warfare is waged without action; the imperial warfare is waged through virtue; the kingly warfare is waged through righteousness—what need is there for arms?\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy is to nearly lose what I treasure. Arms are instruments of ill omen: to observe them is to grow complacent; to grow complacent is to become arrogant; to become arrogant is to lose vigilance. Thus, no misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy. Without vigilance, there is defeat; with defeat, there is weakness; with weakness, there is chaos and ruin—this is why underestimating the enemy nearly loses what I treasure.\n\nTherefore, when armies clash, the side that grieves prevails. The humane possess a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others—not from a love of killing, but to end killing with killing. Thus, when armies clash, to say to others, *\"I am skilled in formation, I am skilled in battle,\"* is a grave transgression—yet the grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. The Great Dao is utterly level—*\"level\"* means *\"easy\"* in its expression. Thus, the Dao is the most level of things, the simplest of instruments. Level, it is easy to know; simple, it is easy to practice. Therefore, I say: *\"My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.\"* Even the ignorance of common men and women can comprehend them; even the unworthiness of common men and women can enact them. At first, they stand alone in clarity; in the end, they vanish like mist—not the fault of common men and women, but because the people’s delusion has lasted too long. Thus, none in the world can know, none can practice.\n\nOnly through lack of knowledge do they fail to know me. The sage observes the spirit without entanglement, emerges from the crowd without scheming. Thus, the mind listens to qi, qi listens to the spirit, the spirit listens to the Dao. Its going forth and returning cannot be known—this is true knowledge. Those who do not know this cannot know me. Yet even if they do not know me, what affliction is it to me?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"If you call me a horse, I will be a horse; if you call me an ox, I will be an ox.\"* Do they truly know me, or do they not? Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade. The patterned leopard’s hide—its markings shine; the scholar’s words—his patterns flourish. Because his patterns flourish, the world has no complete scholars; because its hide shines, the wilds have no unscathed leopards. Should I grieve for them? What can these two do to avoid harm? Alas, their patterns bring them disaster! Thus, the sage appears like a dragon yet dwells like a corpse, sweeps away his shadow and erases his tracks—does he not wish to display his worth? This is what is meant by *\"wearing coarse cloth while holding jade.\"*\n\nTo know yet appear not to know is supreme. Not to know yet claim to know is ignorance.\n\nThose bold in daring will perish; those bold in restraint will live. To wrestle a tiger bare-handed or ford a river without a boat—these are the acts of the bold in daring, who die without regret, and this is enough to destroy their bodies and nothing more. Not standing beneath a crumbling wall—this is the boldness of restraint. Fearing to harm one’s true destiny is enough to preserve one’s life and nothing more. The people do not fear death—why then threaten them with it? This is the lament of the Old Master, a lament for the times. When those above lose the Dao, they esteem cunning and strategy. Esteeming cunning and strategy leads to harsh supervision; harsh supervision leads to a people without recourse, who lightly transgress the law. Thus, the executed lie heaped upon one another—how could they fear death? If cunning and strategy were abandoned, there would be no harsh supervision. Without harsh supervision, reverence for tranquility would prevail, and the people would settle themselves, leaving no crimes to commit—how much less would they fear death?\n\nIf the people were made to constantly fear death, and those who acted strangely were seized and executed, who would dare? Yet if the people fear death and still act strangely, this is one who seeks to stir up disorder among them—such a person is to the people as weeds are to seedlings. Thus, remove the weeds and the seedlings flourish; remove the strange and the people are at peace. If I seize and execute them—\n\nThe people suffer hunger because those above consume excessive taxes. Mencius said: \"There are taxes on cloth and thread, taxes on grain, and corvée labor. If a ruler reduces one and employs the other two, the people will starve.\" To make the people value life and not wander far—this is the opposite of the crimes of tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials. When the old and weak perish in ditches, the people lightly embrace death; when the strong scatter to the four directions, the people lightly wander. Though there may be boats and carriages, none will ride them. Though mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges, this was the world of utmost virtue. Neighboring states gaze upon one another; the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The myriad things thrive in clusters, their villages connected. Thus, neighboring states gaze upon one another, and beasts gather in herds—so the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them.\"\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. The Dao is not questioned; questions receive no answer. The good do not dispute; to question without end is to lack limit. To answer without cease is to lack depth. Thus, those who dispute are not good.\n\n*Jiuhua Collection, Volume Twenty-Three*",

      "translated_text": "**Excerpts from *A Brief Explanation of the Laozi***\n*(By Yuan Xingzong of the Song Dynasty, from *Siku Quanshu*, *Jibu*, *Bieji*, *Jiuhua Ji*, Volume 23)*\n\n---\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.\nEarth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows spontaneity—this is the form of the formless.\nTo seek to describe it is already to err.\nThus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, and spontaneity is the ultimate, the absolute.\nBefore there were things, there was nothing; then, in an instant, things arose.\nOnce things exist, they can be named, yet though they may be named as \"being,\" they cannot yet be called \"the many.\"\nThus, the named becomes the mother of the myriad things.\n\n**Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.**\nThe worthy are the instruments of the state.\nIf the worthy are not employed, the state will be diminished in great matters and weakened in small—how can this be acceptable?\nYet how could it be otherwise?\nThe sage can govern the world through the worthy but cannot make the world value worthiness.\nTo govern through the worthy is to employ them; to not make the world value worthiness is to not exalt them.\nFor exaltation is the root of contention and the origin of deceit.\n\n**Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from becoming thieves.**\nWhen gold and jade fill the halls, none can guard them.\nThus, rare goods are not prized.\nI favor stillness, and the people naturally return to simplicity; therefore, they do not become thieves.\n\n**I do not know whose child it is—it resembles the ancestor of the Emperor.**\nBefore the One and Three had taken form, there was still the One in its unshaped state—I do not know whose child it is.\nWhen things arise, they take shape, and I model them accordingly; the Emperor emerges from *Zhen* (Thunder), and I thus name it \"Emperor.\"\nYet in its beginning, it was vast and silent, and I could not name it.\nI call it \"Dao\" and, by force, name it \"Great\"—that is all.\n\n**Much speech leads to exhaustion.**\nExcessive words are superfluous, for they are untimely.\nSpeak only when the time is right, and people will not weary of your words—thus, they will not be exhausted.\n\n**Heaven is enduring, Earth is lasting.**\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, they are not free from form and measure, so their endurance is limited.\nYet Laozi speaks of \"enduring\" and \"lasting\" only up to Heaven and Earth, for he speaks of what is visible.\nAs for the ultimate in endurance, it is what is called the \"beginning of Heaven and Earth\"—this is it.\n\n**The reason Heaven and Earth can be enduring and lasting is that they do not live for themselves, and thus they can live long.**\nSome ask: \"If Heaven and Earth do not live for themselves, then who gives them life? Is this not absurd?\"\nI say: This is the subtlety of Laozi’s teaching, for he speaks metaphorically.\nHumans live *for* life, and because life is so abundant, they are ultimately burdened by it.\nFree from the burden of life, they do not live for themselves—this is the Way of non-perishing.\nIt is merely a metaphor.\n\n**My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would I have?**\nThe sage lodges me—lodges me in things.\nLodged in things, there are no boundaries; without boundaries, there is no mind.\nWhen it reaches the point of no-mind, who can say whether things are me or I am things?\nThis is called \"no-self.\"\nNo-self is the ultimate in forgetting the body.\nForgetting the body, there are no desires, no entrances, no poisons—what affliction could accumulate?\nYan Hui said: \"Before I had begun to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I was no longer myself.\"\nIf Yan Hui, though employed, was still truly himself, he still had a body.\nNow, having never been himself, he has forgotten his body.\nThus, while others cannot bear their sorrows, Yan Hui does not alter his joy.\nThis is called \"no affliction.\"\n\n**Look at it and it cannot be seen—it is called \"subtle\";**\n**Listen to it and it cannot be heard—it is called \"rare\";**\n**Grasp it and it cannot be held—it is called \"minute.\"**\nWhat I see is what everyone sees.\nThe vision of Li Lou must see what others cannot, yet can his vision surpass this? This is called \"subtle.\"\nWhat I hear is what everyone hears.\nThe hearing of Shi Kuang must hear what others cannot, yet can his hearing be singular? This is called \"rare.\"\nPeople vie to grasp what Wu Huo grasps, yet nothing is seized.\nThough Wu Huo grasps it, he truly obtains nothing—this is the real grasp. This is called \"minute.\"\nThus, the Dao cannot be heard, cannot be seen, cannot be seized.\nTherefore, look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; grasp it and it cannot be held.\n\n**The ancients who were good at being scholars were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating.**\nThe so-called \"scholar\" is one who serves the Dao.\n\"Subtle\" is the heart of the Dao;\n\"wondrous\" is the utmost of subtlety;\n\"profound\" is the gateway to wonder;\n\"penetrating\" is the function of profundity.\nIts coming has no trace; its going leaves no mark. It retreats and hides in secrecy.\nThis is true understanding—thus, it cannot be known.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said in the tradition: *\"Vague and obscure, without intent yet difficult to scheme with.\"* If it were refined, how long would it endure? How trifling it would be!\n\nThe Dao is formless, hence without resemblance. To resemble is to be confined by form—yet to confine form is not the way of form. Is this not petty?\n\nI possess three treasures, which I safeguard and uphold:\nFirst is compassion,\nsecond is frugality,\nthird is not daring to take the lead in the world.\nThese are the distinct teachings of the *Virtue Classic*, what the Old Master embodied in practice.\n\nThe essence of compassion is benevolent virtue;\nthe essence of frugality is obscure virtue;\nthe essence of not daring to take the lead is humble virtue.\n\nCompassion thus enables courage. There was a governance of unyielding kindness—King Wen’s compassion. When the king’s wrath blazed forth, he ultimately responded to the world. Hence it is said: *\"The benevolent are surely courageous.\"*\n\nNot daring to take the lead in the world thus enables one to become the vessel’s elder. The world’s great vessel cannot be made—those who make it ruin it. I do not strive, nor am I enslaved to this vessel, and so I become its elder. This is what is meant by *\"putting oneself last yet coming first.\"*\n\nThose who are skilled at overcoming enemies do not contend. The *Book of Changes*’ *\"Army\"* states: *\"Water within the earth—an army.\"* An army is rectified by the many. Water benefits all things yet does not contend—this is the highest skill in overcoming enemies.\n\nThose who are skilled at employing others place themselves below them. Mencius said: *\"By rank, you are the lord and I the minister; by virtue, you serve me.\"* How dare I compare with them? Thus, Tang’s minister Yi Yin, King Wen’s minister Hong Yao, King Wu’s minister the Duke of Zhou, and Duke Huan’s minister Guan Zhong—though they placed themselves below, they received the mandate. How could they deign otherwise?\n\nIn later ages, none were not lords, yet they could not employ ministers; none were not ministers, yet they did not serve their lords. This arises from nothing else: lords favor ministers for the mandate they receive, not for the way by which they receive it. This is called *\"the virtue of non-contention.\"*\n\nThe tradition states: *\"Contention is the least of affairs.\"* Thus, the Way of Heaven does not contend yet excels at overcoming; the sage’s Way is non-action yet does not contend. Now, when what is called *\"virtue\"* emerges, the Dao recedes—this is virtue’s doing.\n\nThis is called *\"employing the strength of others.\"* I practice non-action and employ the world—who in the world would not be employed by me? It is by employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called *\"matching Heaven, the ancient utmost.\"* Yao asked Xu You: *\"Can Nie Que match Heaven?\"* Xu You replied: *\"He exalts knowledge and races like fire—he is but a thread, merely transforming with things. How could he match Heaven? Yet one who does not compete or contend, who skillfully employs others—this is how to match Heaven to the utmost.\"*\n\nThere is a saying in warfare: *\"I dare not act as host but only as guest.\"* Dare one call this excessive timidity? It is said: *\"What words are these? The noble person only knows how to place himself below others—thus he is seen as below others.\"* Is this not the meaning of the *Book of Changes*’ *\"Army\"*?\n\nIn *\"Army,\"* the sixth line of the third hexagram states: *\"Perhaps bearing corpses in a chariot—misfortune.\"* Yin riding over yang is the fault of rigidity. Advancing without achievement is a punishment that does not fit the crime—this is the error of acting as host rather than guest.\n\nIn *\"Army,\"* the sixth line of the fifth hexagram states: *\"There are birds in the field; it is beneficial to seize them—no blame.\"* The soft occupying the hard’s position does not dare to lead. Going forth and capturing prey brings advantage—this is the principle of acting as guest rather than host.\n\nThus, the harm of acting as host in warfare is like this!

      "translated_text": "If this is reversed, it is the fault of tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials. Some, old and weak, perish in ditches—thus the people hold death lightly.

Mountains lack paths and tunnels; marshes lack boats and bridges—such is an age of utmost virtue.\n\nNeighboring states gaze upon one another; the sounds of chickens and dogs carry between them. Zhuangzi said: \"The myriad creatures live in flocks, bound to their native land.\" Thus, neighboring states gaze upon one another, and beasts gather in herds—hence the sounds of chickens and dogs carry between them.\n\nTruthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful.\nThe Dao is not questioned; questions receive no answer.

Suddenly, things came to be; once there are things, they can be named. Yet though things can be named, they cannot be named as mere multiplicity. Thus, the named becomes the mother of the myriad things.\n\n\"Not to esteem the worthy prevents the people from contending.\"\nThe worthy are the state’s instruments. If the worthy are not employed, the state will diminish if great, weaken if small. Can one do without them? How could one? The sage can govern the world with the worthy but cannot exalt the worthy to govern the world. To govern the world with the worthy is to employ them; to exalt the worthy to govern the world is not to esteem them. For esteem is the root of contention and the source of deceit.\n\n\"Not to prize rare goods prevents the people from stealing.\"\nGold and jade fill the halls, yet none can guard them. Thus, not prizing rare goods, I value stillness, and the people naturally return to simplicity—hence they do not steal.\n\n\"I do not know whose child it is—the image of the Lord’s predecessor.\"\nBefore the One and Three began, there was still the One, though unformed. I do not know whose child it is. When things arise, they take form; I follow their form to name them. When the Lord emerges from the east, I follow the Lord to name him.

      "translated_text": "The heavens endure, the earth persists. Though vast, heaven and earth have not transcended form and number—thus their endurance, though great, remains measurable. Yet Laozi speaks of \"enduring and persisting\" in the utmost, referring only to what is visible. As for the ultimate endurance, it is what is called \"the beginning of heaven and earth.\" That heaven and earth endure so long is because they do not live for themselves—thus they attain long life.\n\nSome ask: If heaven and earth do not live for themselves, who then gives them life? Perhaps they arise spontaneously? This is the subtlety of Laozi’s teaching—he merely suggests as much. Humans live by the abundance of life-giving forces, and thus are ultimately burdened by life. Free from the burden of life, they do not live for themselves. This is the Way of non-perishing, merely suggested in passing.\n\nMy greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would I have? The sage’s lodging of the self is to lodge it in things. Lodged in things, there are no boundaries; without boundaries, there is no mind. When the mind is utterly absent, one does not know whether things are the self or the self is things—this is called \"no-self.\" With no-self comes the utmost forgetting of the body. Forgetting the body, there are no desires, no entrances, no poisons—what affliction could accumulate?\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I began to be employed, I was truly myself. Once employed, I was no longer myself.\" Before there was Yan Hui, he had already forgotten his body. Thus, when others cannot bear their sorrows, Yan Hui remains unchanged in his joy—this is called \"no affliction.\"\n\nLook and it cannot be seen—call it \"subtle.\"\nListen and it cannot be heard—call it \"rare.\"\nGrasp and it cannot be held—call it \"minute.\"\nWhat I see is what the multitude sees. The vision of Li Lou must lie beyond what the multitude does not see—yet can his vision be complete? This is called \"subtle.\" What I hear is what the multitude hears. The hearing of Shi Kuang must lie beyond what the multitude does not hear—yet can his hearing be unified? This is called \"rare.\" The multitude compete in grasping—yet even Wu Huo cannot seize it. Wu Huo grasps at it, yet truly obtains nothing. This is the true grasping—called \"minute.\" Thus the Dao cannot be heard, cannot be seen, cannot be grasped. Therefore, look and it cannot be seen; listen and it cannot be heard; grasp and it cannot be held.\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, deeply unknowable. What is called a scholar is one who serves the Dao. Subtlety is the heart of the Dao; mystery is the utmost of subtlety; profundity is the gateway to mystery; penetration is the function of profundity. Its coming has no side; its going leaves no trace. Retreating, it hides in secrecy—how could it be known?\n\nOnly when one’s demeanor is impartial can it be just. Impartiality leaves nothing unembraced—thus self and other merge within. How could there be partiality?\n\nVast indeed, it has no end! It is whole in every corner, its center everywhere. My Dao is so great it has no gate, no side—radiant in all four directions, why must it have a center?\n\nThe multitude bustle about, as if feasting on grand sacrifices, as if ascending spring terraces. The multitude savor the grand feast, yet do not savor the flavorless; they wander the spring terrace, yet do not wander the ultimate wandering. Thus they end without flavor, conclude without wandering—because they know the ultimate flavor, the ultimate wandering. The true person’s filling of the belly is insipid, without flavor. The true person’s wandering is boundless—seen yet unseen.\n\nThat which is bent becomes whole. A tree’s gnarled knots and hollow ends are not chosen by the carpenter, nor gathered by the woodcutter—thus it fulfills its natural lifespan. This is the effect of \"that which is bent becomes whole.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Straight trees are the first felled.\"\n\nThat which is crooked becomes straight. If a sister-in-law is drowning and one extends a hand to save her, is this crooked? It is called straight. This is \"that which is crooked becomes straight.\" If a father steals a sheep and the son testifies against him, is this straight? It is called crooked. This is \"that which is straight becomes crooked.\"\n\nThat which is low becomes full. Only because it is low can it be filled.",

How could this be true of these alone? The sun at its zenith declines; the moon at its full wanes. Hills erode into valleys; dry earth gives way to flowing water.\n\nThus the sage constantly excels at saving others, and so none are cast aside. Some say: \"Constantly excelling at saving others, none are cast aside.\" The noble person can indeed be saved—how then can the petty person be saved? It is not as you suppose. To measure others by the standard of the sage is to see them as common; to measure others by the standard of common people is to see them as sages. The small is perfected in smallness, the great in greatness—like grasses and trees, each distinct in its kind. Thus to save the noble person: let them study the Dao and love others. To save the petty person: let them study the Dao and become easy to employ. This is what is meant by \"none are cast aside.\"\n\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine—become the world’s valley. As the *Classic* says: \"The world’s intercourse, the world’s female—its intercourse is submission, and thus it receives.\" Therefore it is called the valley.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The affairs of Tang and Wu are examples of this. To act is to ruin it; to grasp is to lose it. Those who took the world in ancient times did so by means of non-action; when they acted, it was insufficient to take the world.\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao does not use weapons to overpower the world. Weapons are instruments of misfortune; war is contrary to virtue. Those who delight in killing are engaged in inauspicious affairs—those with the Dao do not dwell in such things. Confucius said: \"I have not studied the affairs of armies.\" Mencius said: \"Why resort to war?\"\n\nIts consequences return swiftly: what issues from you will rebound upon you. Those who delight in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world. Mencius said: \"Only those who do not delight in killing can unify it.\"\n\nThose who do not lose their place endure. Yan Hui was nearly there—never transferring anger, never repeating a mistake, never deviating from his place all day.

Thus, to savor the flavorless is the solitude of the true person.\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong. Only the softness under heaven suffices to gallop through the utmost hardness. A venerable elder, nearing his end, said to his disciples: \"Is my tongue still here?\" They replied, \"It is.\" \"Are my teeth still here?\" They replied, \"Gone.\" \"The teeth are gone because of their hardness; the tongue remains because of its softness—such is the efficacy of the soft and weak overcoming the hard and strong.\"\n\nFish must not be taken from the depths; the state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others. The tradition says: \"To monopolize the state is called kingship; to master profit and harm is called kingship; to model and hold to it is called kingship—yet the name of kingship suffers loss.\" Thus, if a king displays his instruments to others, others will join together to steal both his instruments and him. When instruments are stolen, names shift—without a state, one cannot avoid perishing. Therefore, those who dwell in Qi hear only of Qi’s Tian clan, not of its king; those who dwell in Qin hear only of Qin’s Marquis Rang, not of its king—this is the fault of showing one’s sharp instruments to others.

      "translated_text": "To gain or to lose—which brings affliction? The multitude says: \"This is gain, that is loss.\" The true person says: \"Loss is also gain, gain is also loss—this neither harms nor benefits the gain.\" To gain or to lose—which brings affliction? Hoarding much ensures heavy loss. Mencius said: \"Those who treasure pearls and jade invite calamity upon themselves.\"\n\nIn learning, one daily accumulates; in pursuing the Dao, one daily diminishes. Diminish and further diminish, until one reaches non-action—through non-action, nothing is left undone. Learning may be learned, but the Dao cannot be attained through learning. The Dao may be attained, but not through learning. If it cannot be attained, then none can know who or what it is. Better to turn inward and align with principle. Turning inward and aligning with principle is called \"diminishing\"; diminish and further diminish, until one reaches the utmost alignment. Thus, through non-action, one attains what is naturally attained. Only then is there no thought, no action—yet responding, one penetrates the patterns of all under heaven. This is what is meant by \"through non-action, nothing is left undone.\"\n\nTherefore, those who govern all under heaven do so by non-interference; when they interfere, they are no longer capable of governing all under heaven. The accumulation of cold and heat, winter and summer—when people discuss summer, they ask: \"Why is the heat so scorching?\" When they discuss winter, they ask: \"Why is the cold so biting?\" They do not reflect that cold and heat, in their alternation, render each other useless, yet their very uselessness gives rise to their great utility. Thus, confining cold and heat to utility is insufficient to constitute true winter and summer; governing all under heaven through interference is insufficient to govern all under heaven.\n\nWhat is good, I deem good; what is not good, I also deem good. Things enslave people, and people call this \"so.\" Yet how is it not so? It is not so because it is so—this must be seized from without. Thus, there is a way to make it not so. Nevertheless, things inherently have their \"so,\" inherently have their \"permissible.\" If things do not adhere to me, then I have a way to equalize them. Having a way to equalize them, nothing is not so, nothing is not permissible. Therefore, \"What is good, I deem good; what is not good, I also deem good.\"\n\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things give them form, and circumstances bring them to completion. The Dao is the mother of the myriad things; virtue is the radiance of the Dao; things are the vessels of virtue; circumstances are the principles of things. The mother can give life, the radiance can nourish, the vessels can take form, and the principles can reach completion.\n\nAll under heaven has a beginning, which serves as the mother of all under heaven. Zhuangzi said: \"There is a beginning, and there is that which precedes the beginning—what precedes the beginning is nameless.\" All under heaven has a beginning, and thus it has a name. The *Classic* says: \"The named is the mother of the myriad things.\" Therefore, the beginning of all under heaven serves as its mother.\n\nHaving grasped the mother, one knows her children.

      "translated_text": "Having known the children, one must again guard the mother. If the mother loses her children or the children lose their mother, the world’s Way is lost. When the world’s Way is lost, how can one return? Thus, why should I alone be different from others? I value seeking sustenance from the mother. To the end of one’s days, one does not perish.\n\nTo know both mother and child is sufficient; to the end of one’s days, one does not perish—what does this mean? It means there is no ground for death. Block the apertures, shut the gates, and one will not toil for a lifetime. Open the apertures, further one’s affairs, and one will not be saved for a lifetime. \"Apertures\" refer to pleasure, which enters from without. Thus, the true person blocks them. Zhuangzi said: \"To open the heavens’ heaven and not open the human’s heaven is to block the apertures and shut the gates. To open the human’s heaven and not open the heavens’ heaven is to open the apertures and further one’s affairs.\" Opening the heavens gives rise to virtue, so one does not toil for a lifetime. Opening the human gives rise to harm, so one is not saved for a lifetime.\n\nTo see the small is called clarity. When King Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi feared; when Chu did not prepare sweet wine for Musheng, he departed; when Zhao killed Mingdu, Confucius did not encounter them. Thus it is said: to see the small is called clarity.\n\nTo guard the soft is called strength. Tang was imprisoned at Xatai, and the Xia perished; King Wen was imprisoned at Youli, and the Shang was destroyed; Goujian groomed horses for Wu, yet after ten generations, Yue endured. Thus it is said: to guard the soft is called strength.\n\nThat descendants may continue sacrifices without cease—Liu Zizheng said: \"When the noble person preserves their spirit, good fortune extends to their descendants.\" Cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true. Cultivate it in the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the village, and one’s virtue becomes enduring. Cultivate it in the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful. Cultivate it in all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nThe *Record* says: \"In ancient times, those who wished to make their illustrious virtue shine throughout all under heaven first governed their states. Wishing to govern their states, they first harmonized their families. Wishing to harmonize their families, they first cultivated their selves. Wishing to cultivate their selves, they first rectified their hearts.\" Now, to well establish and well embrace is to rectify the heart. Thus, cultivate it in the self, and one’s virtue becomes true; harmonize the family, and one’s virtue becomes abundant; cultivate it in the village to govern the state, and one’s virtue becomes bountiful; finally, make illustrious virtue shine throughout all under heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.\n\nThose who contain profound virtue are comparable to an infant. When the spirit is inwardly still, the harmony of heaven is firm. When the harmony of heaven is firm, one preserves the thread of emptiness—this is the guarding of pure qi. Thus it is said: those who contain profound virtue are comparable to an infant. The *Classic* says: \"Can you be like a newborn babe?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Can you be like a little child?\" This is what is meant.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and birds of prey do not strike. Preserving the thread of emptiness, movement and stillness become spirit-like. When movement and stillness are spirit-like, transformation has constancy, and the myriad things are mastered. Alas! Is this not the work of the spirit? Thus, the rhinoceros has no use for its horn—this is what is meant by \"poisonous insects do not sting.\" The tiger has no place to set its claws—this is what is meant by \"fierce beasts do not seize.\" Humans and beasts do not disrupt their herds—this is what is meant by \"birds of prey do not strike.\"\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish. Fish wish to be at ease in the pot; governance wishes to be at ease in the state. If fish are frequently disturbed in the pot, there will be no whole fish. If governance is frequently disturbed among the people, there will be no well-governed state. Though this speaks of small things, it can illustrate great ones.\n\nWhen one attends to all under heaven with the Dao, its ghosts do not become spirits. When the Dao attends to all under heaven, the people all know the joy of heaven. Zhuangzi said: \"When the people know the joy of heaven, there are no human transgressions, no human faults, and no ghosts to blame.\" Thus, its ghosts do not become spirits.\n\nIt is not that its ghosts do not become spirits, but that their spirits do not harm people. The *Tradition* says: \"The people are the masters of ghosts and spirits.\" Spirits rely on people to act. When people are at peace in their duties, the spirits rely on them and act. To harm their master—this has never been. It is not that their spirits do not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm people. When the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge therein.\n\nThe *Explanation of the Laozi* says: \"When the people violate the law, this is called the people harming their superiors. When superiors punish the people, this is called superiors harming the people. When the people do not violate the law and superiors do not employ punishments, this is called superiors not harming. Is this not like ghosts not becoming malevolent? When the people are not violent toward ghosts, and ghosts are not violent toward the people, both are without intent—this is the work of utmost virtue. Thus, when the two do not harm one another, virtue and power converge therein.\"\n\nA great state is the lower reaches.

      "translated_text": "If people are not good, how can they be cast aside? The good I treat with goodness, and the not-good I also treat with goodness—this is how the Old Master saves all things, correcting the world by speaking thus. Therefore it is said: \"Ever skillful in saving people, there are no outcasts.\"\n\nResolve difficulties while they are still easy; accomplish great things while they are still small. What is bright and clear arises from what is dark and obscure; what has pattern arises from what is formless. Bright and clear, patterned as they are, I cannot explain them—because I did not discern them early enough to explain. The difficult affairs of the world must first appear in what is easy; the great affairs of the world must first appear in what is small. Thus the sage, wishing to be above others, speaks as though beneath them; wishing to be ahead of others, places himself behind. Therefore, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel his weight; though he stands in front, they do not feel harmed. Thus the world delights in exalting him without tiring, because he does not contend. Others cling to their doctrines, and I cling to mine—not that I dare not speak, nor that I cannot overcome opponents. Rather, I would rather set aside my doctrine to preserve it. For in setting aside my doctrine to preserve it, I have possessed, from of old, the world’s doctrine. The world delights in exalting and does not tire of it. Though I act, it is the same.\n\nGuanzi said: \"To govern others with superiority has never won people; to govern others by placing oneself below has never failed to win them.\" This is what is meant.\n\nThe world all says my Dao is great, yet it seems unworthy. Precisely because it is great, it seems unworthy. The *Classic* says: \"The multitude all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse\"—this is what makes it seem unworthy. What does the sage gain from this? He gains its semblance of unworthiness. Therefore, to argue is not necessarily wisdom; to be learned is not necessarily intelligence. To employ it is not to exhaust it—what manner of person is he? What manner of person is he? He is what the tradition calls \"dim and obscure, without intent, difficult to plan with.\"\n\nIf it were worthy, it would have long since been petty—for it is fine indeed. The Dao has no form, thus it has no likeness. To be like is to be confined by form; this is not how to be free of form. Is this not small?\n\nI have three treasures that I hold and preserve: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to be first in the world. These are the distinct teachings of the *Virtue Classic*, what the Old Master personally practiced. The reality of compassion is benevolent virtue; the reality of frugality is hidden virtue; the reality of not daring to be first in the world is humble virtue.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous. The governance of one who cannot bear the suffering of others—this was King Wen’s compassion. When he burned with righteous anger, he ultimately triumphed over the world. Thus it is said: \"The benevolent must be courageous.\"\n\nNot daring to be first in the world enables one to become the vessel’s elder. The great vessel of the world cannot be made; to make it is to ruin it. I do nothing and am not enslaved, thus I become the vessel’s elder. This is what is meant by \"putting oneself last and thereby coming first.\"\n\nOne who is skillful in overcoming opponents does not contend. The *Changes* says in *The Army*: \"Within the earth there is water—*The Army*. The noble person uses the multitude with correctness.\" Water benefits the myriad things without contending—this is the greatest good in overcoming opponents.\n\nOne who is skillful in employing others places himself below them. Mencius said: \"In terms of position, you are the lord and I the minister; in terms of virtue, you should serve me. How dare I rank with you?\" Thus, Tang made Yi Yin his minister, King Wen made Hong Yao his minister, King Wu made the Duke of Zhou his minister, and Duke Huan made Guan Zhong his minister. Though they placed themselves below, they received the mandate. For they disdained not the one they served, while later generations—though none are not lords—cannot employ ministers, and none are not ministers yet cannot be employed by lords. This has no other cause: lords love the ministers they receive the mandate from, but do not love the ministers by whom they receive the mandate.\n\nThis is called the virtue of not contending.\n\nThe tradition says: \"Contention is the least of affairs.\" Thus, the Dao of Heaven does not contend yet skillfully overcomes; the Dao of the sage does nothing yet does not contend. Now, what is called virtue emerges from the Dao and enters into virtue—this is why.\n\nThis is called employing the strength of others. I do nothing yet employ the world; who in the world would not be employed by me? It is by employing the strength of others.\n\nThis is called matching Heaven—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nWhen Yao asked Xu You and Nie Que if they could match Heaven, he said: \"They are now exalting knowledge and rushing like fire; they are now entangled in trivialities; they are now blending with things—how could they match Heaven?\" Yet if one does not compete, does not contend, and skillfully employs others, this is matching Heaven to the utmost.\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms: \"I dare not act as host but act as guest.\"\n\nIs not daring to act as host but acting as guest too weak? It is not so. The noble person only knows how to place himself below others, thus he is seen as below others. Is this not what is meant in the *Changes* by *The Army*? In *The Army*, the third six says: \"Some carry corpses in their chariots—misfortune.\" This is the fault of the yin riding the yang, the hard. Advancing achieves nothing; the fault is not fitting. This is the error of acting as host, not as guest. In *The Army*, the fifth six says: \"There are birds in the field; it is beneficial to capture them—no blame.\" Being soft in a hard position, he does not dare to lead. Going forth, he captures the birds—this is the meaning of acting as guest, not as host. Thus, the harm of acting as host in the use of arms is like this. Therefore it is said: \"I dare not.\"\n\nTo seize without arms—\nOne must be patient, then there will be success.",

      "translated_text": "To cast aside arms is to have no enemy—only by not contending does none in the world contend with him; only by not contending does none in the world contend for merit. To grasp no weapon is to have no war—without arms, what is there to strike? Why speak of battle? The highest warfare is waged without action; the imperial warfare is waged through virtue; the kingly warfare is waged through righteousness—what need is there for arms?\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy. To underestimate the enemy is to nearly lose what I treasure. Arms are instruments of ill omen: to observe them is to grow complacent; to grow complacent is to become arrogant; to become arrogant is to lose vigilance. Thus, no misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy. Without vigilance, there is defeat; with defeat, there is weakness; with weakness, there is chaos and ruin—this is why underestimating the enemy nearly loses what I treasure.\n\nTherefore, when armies clash, the side that grieves prevails. The humane possess a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others—not from a love of killing, but to end killing with killing. Thus, when armies clash, to say to others, *\"I am skilled in formation, I am skilled in battle,\"* is a grave transgression—yet the grieving side prevails.\n\nMy words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice, yet none in the world can know them, none can practice them. The Great Dao is utterly level—*\"level\"* means *\"easy\"* in its expression. Thus, the Dao is the most level of things, the simplest of instruments. Level, it is easy to know; simple, it is easy to practice. Therefore, I say: *\"My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.\"* Even the ignorance of common men and women can comprehend them; even the unworthiness of common men and women can enact them. At first, they stand alone in clarity; in the end, they vanish like mist—not the fault of common men and women, but because the people’s delusion has lasted too long. Thus, none in the world can know, none can practice.\n\nOnly through lack of knowledge do they fail to know me. The sage observes the spirit without entanglement, emerges from the crowd without scheming. Thus, the mind listens to qi, qi listens to the spirit, the spirit listens to the Dao. Its going forth and returning cannot be known—this is true knowledge. Those who do not know this cannot know me. Yet even if they do not know me, what affliction is it to me?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"If you call me a horse, I will be a horse; if you call me an ox, I will be an ox.\"* Do they truly know me, or do they not? Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade. The patterned leopard’s hide—its markings shine; the scholar’s words—his patterns flourish. Because his patterns flourish, the world has no complete scholars; because its hide shines, the wilds have no unscathed leopards. Should I grieve for them? What can these two do to avoid harm? Alas, their patterns bring them disaster! Thus, the sage appears like a dragon yet dwells like a corpse, sweeps away his shadow and erases his tracks—does he not wish to display his worth? This is what is meant by *\"wearing coarse cloth while holding jade.\"*\n\nTo know yet appear not to know is supreme. Not to know yet claim to know is ignorance.",

In *The Army*, the fifth six says: \"There are birds in the field; it is beneficial to capture them—no blame.\" Being soft in a hard position, he does not dare to lead. Going forth, he captures the birds—this is the meaning of acting as guest, not as host. Thus, the harm of acting as host in the use of arms is like this. Therefore it is said: \"I dare not.\"\n\nTo seize without arms—\nOne must be patient, then there will be success.",

      "translated_text": "Those bold in daring will perish; those bold in restraint will live. To wrestle a tiger bare-handed or ford a river without a boat—these are the acts of the bold in daring, who die without regret, and this is enough to destroy their bodies and nothing more. Not standing beneath a crumbling wall—this is the boldness of restraint. Fearing to harm one’s true destiny is enough to preserve one’s life and nothing more. The people do not fear death—why then threaten them with it? This is the lament of the Old Master, a lament for the times. When those above lose the Dao, they esteem cunning and strategy. Esteeming cunning and strategy leads to harsh supervision; harsh supervision leads to a people without recourse, who lightly transgress the law. Thus, the executed lie heaped upon one another—how could they fear death? If cunning and strategy were abandoned, there would be no harsh supervision. Without harsh supervision, reverence for tranquility would prevail, and the people would settle themselves, leaving no crimes to commit—how much less would they fear death?\n\nIf the people were made to constantly fear death, and those who acted strangely were seized and executed, who would dare? Yet if the people fear death and still act strangely, this is one who seeks to stir up disorder among them—such a person is to the people as weeds are to seedlings. Thus, remove the weeds and the seedlings flourish; remove the strange and the people are at peace. If I seize and execute them—\n\nThe people suffer hunger because those above consume excessive taxes. Mencius said: \"There are taxes on cloth and thread, taxes on grain, and corvée labor. If a ruler reduces one and employs the other two, the people will starve.\" To make the people value life and not wander far—this is the opposite of the crimes of tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials. When the old and weak perish in ditches, the people lightly embrace death; when the strong scatter to the four directions, the people lightly wander. Though there may be boats and carriages, none will ride them. Though mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges, this was the world of utmost virtue. Neighboring states gaze upon one another; the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The myriad things thrive in clusters, their villages connected. Thus, neighboring states gaze upon one another, and beasts gather in herds—so the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them.\"\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. The Dao is not questioned; questions receive no answer. The good do not dispute; to question without end is to lack limit. To answer without cease is to lack depth. Thus, those who dispute are not good.\n\n*Jiuhua Collection, Volume Twenty-Three*",
