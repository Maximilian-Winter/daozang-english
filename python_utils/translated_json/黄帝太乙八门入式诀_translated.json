  "full_translation": "**The Yellow Emperor’s Taiyi Eight Gates Entry Method (太一八門入式訣)**\n\n**Title:** *The Yellow Emperor’s Taiyi Eight Gates Entry Method*\n**Author:** Unknown\n**Volume:** Three scrolls\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正統道藏), *Dongxuan Section* (洞玄部), *Miscellaneous Techniques Category* (眾術類)\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One: The Yellow Emperor’s Taiyi Eight Gates Entry Method**\n\n**The Yang Hexagram Sequence Gate (逆干顺行)**\nWhen the *Ganzi* (甲子) or *Ganchén* (甲辰) begins, the first gate arises.\n*Ganyin* (甲寅) and *Guxu* (甲戌) emerge from the three palaces.\n*Ganshen* (甲申) marks the sixth palace, *Gawu* (甲午) the eighth—\nObtain them in sequence, and all shall be auspicious.\n\nWherever you arrive, *Rest* is the head.\n*Rest*—the Taiyi divine spirit’s abode.\n*Life* nourishes, *Injury* obstructs, *Blockage* stifles, *Death* ends, *Opening* reveals—\nThis is the wheel’s order; do not neglect it.\n\nAdd *Wu* (戊) to the *Rest* stem for inverse movement,\nYet follow the Eight Gates in their proper order.\nThe enlightened shall not fall into the Three Realms,\nFor the Dao’s path lies within arm’s reach.\n\n**The Yin Hexagram Inversion Gate (顺干逆行)**\n*Ganzi* (甲子) and *Ganchén* (甲辰) depart from the ninth palace,\n*Ganyin* (甲寅) and *Guxu* (甲戌) from the seventh.\n*Ganshen* (甲申) marks the fourth palace, *Gawu* (甲午) the second—\nSeek the Gates in their proper sequence.\n\nFrom nine descending to one is inversion,\nFrom one ascending returns to nine.\nWhen the Gates align with the Three Celestial Odds (*Sanqi*),\nThe path becomes auspicious, free of calamity.\n\nAdd *Wu* (戊) to the *Rest* stem for forward movement,\nYet reverse the Eight Gates, and disaster follows.\nThis is the Gate’s true mystery—\nThe Blue Lagoon’s path is rare and wondrous.\n\n**The Method of the Three Celestial Odds (三奇合门法)**\nHeaven has three Odds: Sun, Moon, and Star.\nEarth has three Odds: *Yi* (乙), *Bing* (丙), *Ding* (丁).\nMan has three Odds: Spirit, Qi, and Essence.\nThe Gates have three Odds: *Opening*, *Rest*, and *Life*.\n\nWhen *Yi*, *Bing*, and *Ding* align, fortune comes.\nIf the Gates coincide with the Three Odds, travel is auspicious.\nThe Three Odds’ path belongs to the Three Teachings;\nThe rest descend into the *Jing* (景) realm as lesser beings.\n\n**Recognizing the Gates’ Nature (识认门户法)**\nThe *Rest* Gate leads to distant contention,\nThe *Life* Gate directs one to the Immortal’s realm.\nThe *Opening* Gate governs officialdom, seals, and decrees,\nWhile the *Injury* Gate summons the *Asura* (修罗) demons.\n\nThe *Jing* (景) realm below is the path of human destiny,\nThe *Surprise* and *Opening* Gates invite ghosts to terror.\nThe *Blockage* Gate brings silence and stammering,\nThe *Death* Gate plunges one into hell’s boiling cauldron.\n\n**Discerning Future Paths at the Threshold (识认前程临境法)**\nWhen banners and flowers summon you,\nYou’ll be reborn as a donkey or horse.\nWhen bells, chimes, iron clappers, and drums resound,\nYou’ll consort with dogs, chickens, sheep, and licentiousness.\n\nIf you see *Vajra* (金刚) or *Rakshasa* (罗剎) demons,\nYou’ll be drawn into earthly strife toward the Western Paradise.\nIf white clouds, tortoises, and cranes guide you,\nYou’ll ascend to the Three Pure Ones as a Heavenly Immortal.\n\nIf you ride the clouds and harness the qi,\nYou’ll return to the *Coagulated Egg* (卵胎) as a flying *Yuan* (飞鸢).\nIf feasts of Eight Delicacies and Five Flavors beckon,\nYou’ll become a hungry ghost, suffering cold and hunger.\n\nIf *Zǐjǔ* (紫举) or *Bái jǔ* (白举) summon you,\nYou’ll return to the human path.\nIf you follow beauty into the underworld,\nYou’ll be reborn with deformities, plunged into boiling medicine.\n\nIf wolves, tigers, and leopards appear,\nYou’ll wander into the mountains as a beast.\nIf arms, flags, and soldiers march with horses,\nYou’ll become an *Asura* of cruel and obstinate nature.\n\nOnly when all perils vanish before your eyes\nWill you, in an instant, ascend to the Great Dao’s realm.\nA single misguided thought must be avoided—\nDo not cling to greed; observe with equanimity.\n\n**The Method of Piercing the Mysteries (通幽洞微打当法)**\nAll mortals face the number of impermanence,\nBound by yin’s death and yang’s birth.\nYin is death, yang is life—\nYet birth and death in yin and yang hold no grudge.\n\nIf one awakens to the Eight Gates of the Immortals,\nWithin the Eight Gates lies a single path.\nThe *Blockage* Gate conceals the wheel of rebirth—\nThis profound method few may encounter.\n\nWhen the divine lamp illuminates the moon’s hour,\nArrange the *dàdàng* (打當) with foresight.\nEntering *Dayuan* (乾元) with *Li* (利) and *Zhen* (貞),\nIn meditation, return to the Root—no coming, no going.\n\nEnter the *Blockage* Gate in seven steps,\nYet beyond it, no form is seen, no one encountered.\nWithout coming or going in stillness,\nThus, *Zàng* (臧) abides in the True and Perfect.\n\nAbiding is coming yet not turning—\nFrom this, the Three Realms’ path is severed.\nAwakening to this is the *Outer World’s Person*,\nPreserving the body, never buried in the *Blockage*’s seal.\n\n**Pointing to the Root Essence (指陈根元法)**\nExhort the world to diligence and frugality,\nTo moderate eating, store wealth, and enrich the family.\nYet the enlightened do not follow this path.\nThey cultivate emptiness and tranquility,\nConserve essence, nurture qi,\nStabilize the spirit to solidify the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Simply sit or lie still,\nClarify the heart, gaze long, concentrate the spirit—\nDraw in and store the breath naturally.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Close the *Dui* (兑) orifice,\nSeal the Gates, and never labor in vain.*\n*Dui* is metal—\nMetal generates water and carves wood,\nInternally corresponding to the lungs.\nThe lungs generate qi, qi generates fluids—\nThis is the *Jinye* (金液, \"Golden Elixir\").\n\nThe lungs again generate qi—\nBreathing in and out, all stems from this.\n*Mianmian* (绵绵) means subtle and unbroken.\nMetal belongs to the *Dui* hexagram;\nThe mouth is *Dui*’s portal—\nClose the mouth, store the breath,\nDraw the pure qi to the *Xuangu* (玄谷) to prolong life.\n\nFrom storing in the *Taicang* (太倉) to *Ren* (任) breath,\nFrom *Ren* breath to *Ding* (定) breath,\nFrom *Ding* breath to *Wu* (無) breath—\nFrom *Wu* breath, the wheel of birth and death ceases.\n\nAgain, the *Damó* (达磨) *Táixī* (胎息) Secret says:\n*\"Diligently guard the True,\nDo not indulge—\nInternally, nothing escapes;\nExternally, nothing enters.\nReturn to the Origin—\nAll affairs are complete.*\nIf you attain this,\nDo not lose the True—\nExtend life and preserve forever.\"\n\nAgain, the Immortal Child says:\n*\"Walking, sitting still, or moving—\nStillness and motion, sitting and lying—\nNone contradict.\"*\n\nAgain, Master *Guangdé* (廣德) says:\n*\"Sit quietly in a grass hut,\nCalm the heart, replenish the Original Qi.\nOne hour of stillness\nCan escape the wheel of rebirth.*\n\nThose who dwell eternally in the world\nMust rely on the Eight Gates to depart.\nIf one cannot awaken,\nThe path to longevity and immortality is lost.\"\n\n**The Laws of Departure and Abode (出入去住法)**\nAh, humanity dwells between Heaven and Earth—\nWho knows their birthdays, who knows their death hours?\nOnly the Sage comprehends this.\n\nThe beings of *Nányánfú* (南阎浮提) know birth but not death,\nBound in the wheel of rebirth since beginningless time,\nUnable to escape the *Death Gate* until today.\n\nNow encountering the *Taiyi Eight Gates*,\nMeeting a superior adept,\nWith clear instructions and understanding of inversion and sequence,\nMastering yin and yang’s principles,\nRecognizing the four seasons and eight nodes,\nDeciphering the wheel of *Ganzi* day-stems,\nSolving the Eight Gates’ openings and closings—\nThen you may depart in freedom,\nMove without hindrance,\nRoam east and west,\nWander south and north within the *Duōtuó* (兜陀) Palace.\n\n**The Laws of Departure and Abode (出入去住法) – Continued**\n\n「Or you may attain the *Xuǎnyǔ* (玄圃) and *Máitái* (瑷台),\nOr you may attain the *Ten Directions of All the Heavens* (十方诸天),\nOr you may attain the *Sanqīng* (三清) Realms.\n\nIf one’s reason is clear and discerning,\nOne may naturally perceive the *Six Paths* (六道),\nArriving without hindrance—just as words spoken are heard,\nNot in mere idle discourse of countless *kalpas* (劫).\n\nYángzǐ (扬子) said:\nIn *Yíngzhōu* (赢州), the path of ten thousand *li* of misty mountains\nIs winding and ever-extending,\nYet with but a stretch of the arm, one arrives early,\nAnd when returning, all is within one’s sight—\nThis is the meaning of such teachings still.\n\n**The Method of the Three-Five-One (三五一点勘天年日时法)**\nTake one *liáng* (两) of frankincense,\nDivide into four parts.\nLight the *Shén Dēng* (神灯) with its shadow.\nPrepare thirty *jìnzǎo* (晋枣)—boiled and ripe—\nAlso divided into four parts.\nUse a single large white jar,\nUntouched by any hands.\nFill with four *liáng* (两) of pure oil,\nA sheet of *xiānglú* (香炉) paper,\nFour measures of *zhēngshuǐ* (争水),\nA set of brush, inkstone, and ink,\nAnd a new white mat.\nOne hundred and twenty *zu* (足) of clear, open *qián* (钱).\n\nArrange the following items as specified:\nOn the *suìdàn* (岁旦) night,\nSweep and purify a single chamber.\nPlace the brush, inkstone, ink, censer, dates, and paper\nUpon the mat beneath the wall.\nInstall the lamp on the southern wall,\nFirst inserting three wicks, then five stalks,\nAll drawn to a single point and lit.\nAscend the mat, sit upright facing the lamp,\nGaze fixed upon the flame as though it were a great lotus,\nSilently reciting the *kè* (课) and *shuō* (说) within.\n\nFrom the one hundred and twenty *qián* (钱),\nDraw one aside as a *shì* (式).\nIf one assumes a lifespan of fifty years,\nAnd counts to the fifty-first *qián* (文),\nThen the shadow will vanish before one’s eyes,\nRevealing the truth—\nThus counting until all coins are exhausted,\nRecord the findings on paper,\nBurn the first portion of incense,\nAnd pray: *\"In devotion to the Dao, disciple [name],*\n*Taking refuge in the *Nányánfú* (南阎浮提) world,*\n*Knowing my birthday,*\n*Yet my death year unseen,*\n*Now encountering the Three-Five-One Method,*\n*The lamp’s shadow illuminated.*\n*Should my lifespan end,*\n*And my body vanish without shadow,*\n*My spirits—*Sanhún* (三魂) and *Qīpò* (七魄), the *Twenty-Four Gods* (二十四神)—\n*Must not be alarmed.*\n\n*Rapidly strike the teeth,*\n*And when the spirits settle,*\n*Return to counting,*\n*Record on paper,*\n*Burn the second portion of incense,*\n*And pray: *\"Disciple [name]’s death year is known,*\n*Yet the month remains unseen.*\n\n*Again, with thirteen *qián* (文) prepared as before,*\n*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*\n*In dread and fear,*\n*Recite the *zhòu* (咒) and strike the teeth,*\n*Gather the spirits as before,*\n*And when the nature is stilled,*\n*Count until all coins are exhausted,*\n*Record the findings,*\n*Burn the third portion of incense,*\n*And pray: *\"Disciple [name]’s death month is known,*\n*Yet the day remains unseen.*\n\n*Again, with thirty *qián* (文) prepared as before,*\n*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*\n*In anxious terror,*\n*Strike the teeth once more,*\n*Gather the spirits as before,*\n*And when the nature is stilled,*\n*Count until all coins are exhausted,*\n*Record the findings,*\n*Burn the fourth portion of incense,*\n*And pray: *\"Disciple [name]’s death day is known,*\n*Yet the hour remains unseen.*\n\n*Again, with twelve *qián* (文) prepared as before,*\n*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*\n*Strike the teeth,*\n*Gather the spirits,*\n*And when the nature is stilled,*\n*Count until all coins are exhausted,*\n*Seeing the first *qián* (文) as *yīn* (子), the second as *chǒu* (丑), the third as *yín* (寅).*\n\n**For those who practice the Dao:**\nMust first observe strict *fasts* (斋戒), bathe in purity,\nAvoiding sounds, colors, wine, and meat,\nCalming body and mind in stillness—\nOnly after seven days may the method be imparted,\nNot to be taken lightly.\n\n**The Method of Evading Calamity and Avoiding Perils (避难躲闪入杜门法)**\nRecord the year, month, day, and hour,\nAnd follow the method accordingly.»\n\n**Incantation:**\n\n*\"The Most High declares:*\nIf you wish to cross the Three Calamities and Nine Perils,\nSpeak thus:\n\n*'I take Heaven as my father,\nEarth as my mother,\nAnd dwell within them,\nEver as an innocent child.\nThe Sun is my Functionary,\nThe Moon my Clerk.*\n\n*Thunder Lord and Lightning Mother stand before and behind me.\nWind Lord and Rain Master stand at my sides.*\n\n*The Six Celestial Stems and Directing Symbols encircle me completely.\nThe Azure Dragon supports my left,\nThe White Tiger my right.\nThe Vermilion Bird stands before me,\nThe Dark Warrior follows behind.\nThe Northern Dipper covers my head,\nThe Heavenly Ganges points to my feet.*\n\n*The Soaring Serpent is in my hand,\nTo annihilate misfortune and guilt for me.*\n\n*I dwell within the Cinnabar Chamber,\nWith Taiyi as my consort.\nThree on my left, seven on my right,\nNine above my head, one beneath my feet.\nTwo and four are my shoulders,\nSix and eight my feet.\nI occupy the center,\nAs my fullness within.*\n\n*Now in this age of calamity,\nTen thousand demons and spirits\nMust each return to their native lands.*\n\n*Those who confront me shall die,\nThose who turn from me shall perish.\nHasten to flee and hide!\nHeaven’s Executioners,\nSever the ghosts of ill-omen!*\n\n*Swiftly, as the Most High Laozi commands and restrains.*\n\n*[For] both official and private use.\"*\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams of the

alike.\n\nThe **Supreme One’s Eight Gates Dao** of the **Huangdi**,\nThe **顺** Gate and **逆** Gate’s decrees.\n\n#1 [Text missing or incomplete.]\n\nThe **Huangdi’s Supreme One Eight Gates Entry Formula** (Scroll Upper Section):\n\nThe **玉女** is the **太阴**, the **太清**.\nThe **玉女** is the **Six Ding**, **Eight Li**—Yin deities of the Great Heavenly Emperor,\nManifesting in the **刀利天** with their **符**,\nSummoning the **Six Ding** and all gods of **Hai** and **Jia**,\nTogether reciting the **Three Formulas of Great Power and Virtue**,\nAnd receiving the **天罪天魁禹步神祝** #1,\nTo send into the mortal realm,\nAverting calamities and escaping misfortunes,\nRemoving disasters and annihilating misfortunes,\nTo quell rebellious bandits and exterminate malevolent spirits.\n\nIn the time of the **Yellow Emperor (轩辕)**,\nThe **Chi You (蚩尤)** General caused chaos,\nSlaughtering countless lives, beyond reckoning.\nThe **Yellow Emperor**, unable to bear it,\nHad fought **Chi You** in many battles but could not conquer him,\nFinding no way to destroy him.\n\nThe **玉女** spoke: *\"Your servant, before descending to the mortal world,\nEmployed these Three Formulas of sacred script to aid the people,\nExterminating the wicked and vanquishing malevolent spirits.\nYet I dared not take this for myself alone.\"*\n\nThe **Heavenly Emperor** said: *\"If you uphold this method,\nYou may move mountains and overturn seas,\nCrush evil demons,\nConceal your form and vanish your shadow,\nSummon clouds and bring forth rain—\nUnfathomable and beyond thought.\nThis method may be passed to those who seek the Dao.\nIf one seeks liberation,\nKeep its secrets well-guarded.\nFor oneself or others,\nTransform misfortune into fortune,\nCommand ghosts and spirits—\nNow, if you take strange foreign texts and rare treasures,\nIt shall be as easy as child’s play.\nIf you uphold this method with unwavering diligence,\nAll gold, silver, and seven treasures of the world\nShall come to you without seeking.\nYou now descend to aid the **Yellow Emperor** in crushing **Chi You’s** rebellion,\nRemoving the nation’s calamities.\nAfter achieving **Great Peace**,\nEntrust this method to virtuous scholars of the Dao,\nWho shall uphold it—\nNone shall fail in their desires.\nPast and future,\nAll matters shall be known,\nNo question shall remain unanswered.\nIts efficacy is most profound and rare.\nThe Heavenly Emperor declares:\nPure and virtuous scholars of the Dao,\nIf they uphold this method,\nShall attain longevity and everlasting life,\nEnduring vitality without bounds.\"*\n\nThe **Great God’s Incantation** thus:\n\n*\"It can make the **Six Ding** emerge from the **幽** and enter the **冥**,\nFearless and unalarmed.\nUnshaken for ten thousand years,\nUnfallen for a hundred thousand ages.\nToday’s **禹步**, ascending to the **Heavenly Court**,\nDescending to the **Earthly Principles**,\nDao and Virtue for eternal life.\nSwiftly, as the **Law of the Supreme Laozi** commands and restrains.*\n\n*\"Uphold it, like the sun and moon illuminating the world.\nI now further reveal the **Six Ding’s** divine **印**,\nGranting those who practice its rites swift power and divine efficacy.\"*\n\nThe **First Seal**: First, extend the little finger and ring finger straight upward to meet the middle finger at its first joint. This seal enables the practitioner to conceal their shadow and hide their form.\n\nThe **Second Seal**: Without altering the previous position, hook the little finger inward. Then, while holding the seal before the heart, recite the incantation a hundred times. This grants the practitioner the power to fly beyond the heavens, to move mountains and uproot seas—subtle and wondrous techniques.\n\nThe **Third Seal**: Retain the prior form, but clasp the right fist over the left hand at heart level. This seal allows the practitioner to summon the finest treasures of the world, bestowing them upon those who practice, to bestow mercy and relieve suffering.\n\nThe **Fourth Seal**: Keep the previous form, but press both fists together, palms facing inward. This seal makes noble persons appear, granting a radiant and graceful countenance, smooth passage in all affairs, and the power to summon clouds and bring rain.\n\nThe **Fifth Seal**: Retain the prior form, but extend the thumb straight upward, aligning its mark with the center. This seal governs metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, enabling the practitioner to refine their body, attain longevity, and preserve their youth.\n\nThe **Sixth Seal**: The **Machine Seal** (*jīshǒu*). This grants mastery over the **Taiyin**—the **Jade Maiden** will ever stand at one’s side. Nothing shall be denied, so long as the practitioner remains resolute in will and recites the incantation.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor declares:\n*\"Guard these seals with care—do not reveal them to the unworthy. Once one attains this method, pass it only to three others. This is the path to escape suffering’s sea and ascend the Dao of immortality. Do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy; maintain purity in practice and observance. My method is established within the sacred altar, sealed by oath and decree—most sublime and wondrous. If you transmit these seals to others, thereafter do not act hastily. A second transmission will render the method ineffective, risking ruin. Thus, the altar’s oath is binding: henceforth, follow the seals in silence, unspoken. The divine efficacy of Taiyin and the Jade Maiden shall be unrestrained.*\n\n*This method is most fitting for those who seek hidden mysteries, not to be seen or heard by the unworthy—guard it with reverence.\"*\n\nThe **Great Heavenly Emperor of the Three Sovereigns** declares:\n*\"According to the prescribed rites, there exist the **Taiyin Jade Maiden**, the **Six Ding**, and the **Eight Officials**—six divine talismans governing the paths. They fly ten thousand *li*, reporting to the realm. They can also retrieve the world’s rare treasures and wealth, boundless in use. Those who bear the seals and talismans shall wield unerring power, nothing shall be denied. The **Taiyin Jade Maiden** commands the Nine Heavenly Maidens and knows all messages from a thousand *li* away, as if before her eyes. She transcends heaven and earth—beyond comprehension. When wearing the talisman and entering battle, the enemy shall retreat and submit.*\n\n*The **Six Ding Divine Generals’ Talismans** follow:\n\n1. **Dingmao Divine General**—of the Xu Yi household, surnamed Gongsun Qi. The deity wears Daoist robes with a rabbit-headed crown, wielding a spear in the right hand. He has the power to summon clouds, bring rain, and break enemy formations.\n\n2. **Dingchou Divine General**—of the Xu Ke household, surnamed Chengzi. The deity wears yellow robes with a cow-headed crown, holding a *wǔ* (halberd) in both hands, named Zilin. He retrieves strange treasures from the sea.\n\n3. **Divine General**—of the Sima Guang household, surnamed Shiji. The deity wears black robes with a *dǔtóu* (block-shaped) crown, holding a *chēng* (axe) in the right hand, named Lingcheng. He flies vast distances on land, retrieving the world’s finest treasures.\n\n4. **Dingyou Divine General**—of the Shi Zhong household, surnamed Ganke. The deity wears white robes with a chicken-headed crown, holding a crossbow in the left hand. The Heavenly Maiden commands ghosts and spirits to flee with thunder and lightning, summoning clouds and rain.\n\n5. **Divine General**—of the Gongsun Jie household, surnamed Simasheng. The deity wears yellow Daoist robes with a ram-headed crown, holding a spear in the left hand. He has the power to turn day into night.\n\n6. **Dingyi Divine General**—of the Gongsun Guang household, surnamed Simaqing. The deity wears crimson robes with a snake-headed crown, holding a pickaxe in the left hand. He has the power to move mountains and overturn seas.\n\n*For the aforementioned six **Ding** and **Jade Maiden talismans**, during a lunar eclipse, gather **Du Jing** wood (or *wú*tong, or *bèi* wood), carving a plaque nine *cun* long, two *fēn* thick. Write the deity’s name with *xionghuang* (realgar) on the reverse, then sew it into a pouch. If deploying troops, at the general’s location, inscribe the talisman for the corresponding day of the *ganzhi* cycle. For example, on a *jiazi* day, inscribe the **Dingmao talisman** and hang it toward the enemy on the altar. The troops shall immediately retreat or surrender, daring not to face it.*\n\n*When gathering wood, first have someone observe the lunar eclipse’s timing, then bathe and fast for three days beforehand. Prepare dried meat and burn incense in sacrifice before felling the tree. The incantation reads:*\n\n*'Du Jing wood, spirit of longing,\nDescendant [name] of the [surname] clan,\nCalms the transformations of the Six *Jia*,\nFollows my will with reverence,\nOffers wine and dried meat,\nPrays for divine descent, drunk and sated.\nSwiftly, as the Law commands and restrains.'*\n\n*After the sacrifice, the wood is cut and carved into plaques.

If one wishes to summon them, simply call their names, and their divine efficacy will be verified.\n\nIn ancient times, *Guǐgǔ Zǐ* (鬼谷子), *Zhāng Tài Xuān* (张太玄), *Tánggōng Bì* (唐公弼), *Fèi Chángfáng* (费长房), *Lǐ Bā Bó* (李八伯), *Táo Xiānsheng* (陶先生), *Lǔ Āigōng* (鲁哀公), *Luòqiú Zǐ* (珞球子), *Wǔ Zǐxū* (伍子胥), *Zhāng Zǐfáng* (张子房), *Lǔ Pínggōng* (鲁平公), *Zhōu Wénlóng Xiānsheng* (周文隆先生), *Wáng Zǐqiáo* (王子乔), *Níng Xiānsheng* (宁先生), *Sòng Yuán* (宋员), *Zuǒ Gōngfáng* (左公房), *Huáinán Zǐ* (淮南子), *Nǚluó Xiānsheng* (女罗先生), and *Xiè Zìrán* (谢自然) all practiced this method, and all attained the Dao/Way of immortality.\n\nIf one cannot maintain purity, abstaining from conjugal relations and avoiding lustful desires, they may only achieve longevity. To retain wealth and noble status for ten thousand years without loss is to attain immortality.\n\nThe masters passed down this method, which can cure myriad human ailments, reveal the names and dwellings of ghosts and spirits, and discern the movements of all malevolent and supernatural beings—including the Six Ding and the Jade Women. All matters of life, death, fortune, and misfortune, as well as great and small affairs, will be revealed in dreams.\n\nOnly those who are cautious in speech and conduct may encounter this method; then all matters will proceed according to their will.\n\nIf a state possesses this text, it will repel all evil, and strange tongues and supernatural beings will never approach its gates. Even a hundred thousand pounds of gold cannot be transmitted to those who do not cherish this method—it is only passed to refined and virtuous individuals. Practicing the method of the Six Ding and Jade Women is indeed a wondrous Dao/Way.\n\nThe Six Ding are associated with the following positions:\n- *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) and *Dīngwèi* (丁未) belong to the Four Palaces,\n- *Dīngjǐ* (丁巳) and *Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) belong to the Seven Palaces,\n- *Dīnghài* (丁亥) stands directly south in the Nine Palaces,\n- *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) is always stationed at the Three Palaces.\n\nThe Jade Women say: According to the method, establish the day and palace of the gate, adding *yángjiǎ* (阳甲, the heavenly stem). For example, if it is the first day of the first month (*jīngzǐ* 甲子), the *Fúdé* (福德, Deity of Auspicious Virtue) is stationed in the First Palace, while the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) is stationed at *Dīng* (丁).\n\nThe cycle then repeats:\n- *Jīng* (甲) in the *Shèn* (震) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),\n- *Bǐng* (丙) in the *Chén* (辰) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),\n- *Dīng* (丁) in the *Kǎn* (坎) month is auspicious for the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest),\n- *Wù* (戊) in the *Duì* (兑) month is the *Jīngmén* (惊门, Gate of Alarm),\n- *Gēng* (庚) in the *Kūn* (坤) month is the *Sǐmén* (死门, Gate of Death),\n- *Xīn* (辛) in the *Lǐ* (离) month is the *Yǐngmén* (景门, Gate of Reflection).\n\nThe Jade Women say: If the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) or *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life) passes through *Yǐ* (乙), *Bǐng* (丙), or *Dīng* (丁), they are the three auspicious *qímén* (奇门, Strange Gates). When the *Dīng* (丁) character is placed on the feet or face, the gates of the left and right are closed, sealing the earthly entrance.\n\nIncantation follows. The incantation says:」\n\n**Translation:**\n\n---\n**Glory resplendent, radiant and vast—\nThe luminous light of Heaven and Earth.**\n**Thunder’s might and lightning’s strike—\nBanishing all ill

inner right hand—*\n*Speak not, hold the breath, and write.*\n\n*This method is divinely efficacious.*\n*Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai recorded this talisman’s method.*\n*In the late Han, during the Three Kingdoms,*\n*The Prime Minister Zhuge Liang of Western Shu,*\n*Employed the Seven Captures and Seven Releases,*\n*And subdued the barbarian chieftains and rebel generals—*\n*This same method.*\n*If they do not depart,*\n*They shall be bewildered by fate.*\n\n*Count swiftly from the Dipper’s Mouth—*\n*This is the marvel.*\n\n*«In all cases of invoking this method, inscribe the talismans and charms and place them in the location where the lost item was taken.\n\nThis thief spirit, surnamed *Quan* (泉), named *Yang* (恙),\nTakes the form of a human head, with hair shorn to expose the top of

is malevolent—\nWith its left hand wielding a spear, its right clutching money and stolen goods,\nAnd it delights in killing people.\nIf this thief has already harmed or wounded you,\nOr injured your own body, how then shall you resolve it?\nAs with petty thieves who steal,\nUse all manner of spells and techniques to capture it.\n\nWrite the talismans in vermilion on silk,\nAnd draw the thief’s likeness of both form and spirit.\nThen, at the lost item’s location,\nOr beneath the Dipper’s Mouth in the western courtyard,\nRecite incantations to the Five Directions:\nReverently summon the

observe with equanimity.\n\n**The Method of Piercing the Mysteries (通幽洞微打当法)**\nAll mortals face the number of impermanence,\nBound by yin’s death and yang’s birth.\nYin is death, yang is life—\nYet birth and death in yin and yang hold no grudge.\n\nIf one awakens to the Eight Gates of the Immortals,\nWithin the Eight Gates lies a single path.\nThe *Blockage* Gate conceals the wheel of rebirth—\nThis profound method few may encounter.\n\nWhen the divine lamp illuminates the moon’s hour,\nArrange the *dàdàng* (打當) with foresight.\nEntering *Dayuan* (乾元) with *Li* (利) and *Zhen* (貞),\nIn meditation, return to the Root—no coming, no going.\n\nEnter the *Blockage* Gate in seven steps,\nYet beyond it, no form is seen, no one encountered.\nWithout coming or going in stillness,\nThus, *Zàng* (臧) abides in the True and Perfect.\n\nAbiding is coming yet not turning—\nFrom this, the Three Realms’ path is severed.\nAwakening to this is the *Outer World’s Person*,\nPreserving the body, never buried in the *Blockage*’s seal.\n\n**Pointing to the Root Essence (指陈根元法)**\nExhort the world to diligence and frugality,\nTo moderate eating, store wealth, and enrich the family.\nYet the enlightened do not follow this path.\nThey cultivate emptiness and tranquility,\nConserve essence, nurture qi,\nStabilize the spirit to solidify the Dao.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"Simply sit or lie still,\nClarify the heart, gaze long, concentrate the spirit—\nDraw in and store the breath naturally.\"*\n\nAgain it says:\n*\"Close the *Dui* (兑) orifice,\nSeal the Gates, and never labor in vain.*\n*Dui* is metal—\nMetal generates water and carves wood,\nInternally corresponding to the lungs.\nThe lungs generate qi, qi generates fluids—\nThis is the *Jinye* (金液, \"Golden Elixir\").\n\nThe lungs again generate qi—\nBreathing in and out, all stems from this.\n*Mianmian* (绵绵) means subtle and unbroken.\nMetal belongs to the *Dui* hexagram;\nThe mouth is *Dui*’s portal—\nClose the mouth, store the breath,\nDraw the pure qi to the *Xuangu* (玄谷) to prolong life.\n\nFrom storing in the *Taicang* (太倉) to *Ren* (任) breath,\nFrom *Ren* breath to *Ding* (定) breath,\nFrom *Ding* breath to *Wu* (無) breath—\nFrom *Wu* breath, the wheel of birth and death ceases.\n\nAgain, the *Damó* (达磨) *Táixī* (胎息) Secret says:\n*\"Diligently guard the True,\nDo not indulge—\nInternally, nothing escapes;\nExternally, nothing enters.\nReturn to the Origin—\nAll affairs are complete.*\nIf you attain this,\nDo not lose the True—\nExtend life and preserve forever.\"\n\nAgain, the Immortal Child says:\n*\"Walking, sitting still, or moving—\nStillness and motion, sitting and lying—\nNone contradict.\"*\n\nAgain, Master *Guangdé* (廣德) says:\n*\"Sit quietly in a grass hut,\nCalm the heart, replenish the Original Qi.\nOne hour of stillness\nCan escape the wheel of rebirth.*\n\nThose who dwell eternally in the world\nMust rely on the Eight Gates to depart.\nIf one cannot awaken,\nThe path to longevity and immortality is lost.\"\n\n**The Laws of Departure and Abode (出入去住法)**\nAh, humanity dwells between Heaven and Earth—\nWho knows their birthdays, who knows their death hours?\nOnly the Sage comprehends this.\n\nThe beings of *Nányánfú* (南阎浮提) know birth but not death,\nBound in the wheel of rebirth since beginningless time,\nUnable to escape the *Death Gate* until today.\n\nNow encountering the *Taiyi Eight Gates*,\nMeeting a superior adept,\nWith clear instructions and understanding of inversion and sequence,\nMastering yin and yang’s principles,\nRecognizing the four seasons and eight nodes,\nDeciphering the wheel of *Ganzi* day-stems,\nSolving the Eight Gates’ openings and closings—\nThen you may depart in freedom,\nMove without hindrance,\nRoam east and west,\nWander south and north within the *Duōtuó* (兜陀) Palace.",

This seal enables the practitioner to conceal their shadow and hide their form.\n\nThe **Second Seal**: Without altering the previous position, hook the little finger inward. Then, while holding the seal before the heart, recite the incantation a hundred times. This grants the practitioner the power to fly beyond the heavens, to move mountains and uproot seas—subtle and wondrous techniques.\n\nThe **Third Seal**: Retain the prior form, but clasp the right fist over the left hand at heart level. This seal allows the practitioner to summon the finest treasures of the world, bestowing them upon those who practice, to bestow mercy and relieve suffering.\n\nThe **Fourth Seal**: Keep the previous form, but press both fists together, palms facing inward. This seal makes noble persons appear, granting a radiant and graceful countenance, smooth passage in all affairs, and the power to summon clouds and bring rain.\n\nThe **Fifth Seal**: Retain the prior form, but extend the thumb straight upward, aligning its mark with the center. This seal governs metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, enabling the practitioner to refine their body, attain longevity, and preserve their youth.\n\nThe **Sixth Seal**: The **Machine Seal** (*jīshǒu*). This grants mastery over the **Taiyin**—the **Jade Maiden** will ever stand at one’s side. Nothing shall be denied, so long as the practitioner remains resolute in will and recites the incantation.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor declares:\n*\"Guard these seals with care—do not reveal them to the unworthy. Once one attains this method, pass it only to three others. This is the path to escape suffering’s sea and ascend the Dao of immortality. Do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy; maintain purity in practice and observance. My method is established within the sacred altar, sealed by oath and decree—most sublime and wondrous. If you transmit these seals to others, thereafter do not act hastily. A second transmission will render the method ineffective, risking ruin. Thus, the altar’s oath is binding: henceforth, follow the seals in silence, unspoken. The divine efficacy of Taiyin and the Jade Maiden shall be unrestrained.*\n\n*This method is most fitting for those who seek hidden mysteries, not to be seen or heard by the unworthy—guard it with reverence.\"*\n\nThe **Great Heavenly Emperor of the Three Sovereigns** declares:\n*\"According to the prescribed rites, there exist the **Taiyin Jade Maiden**, the **Six Ding**, and the **Eight Officials**—six divine talismans governing the paths.

Those who bear the seals and talismans shall wield unerring power, nothing shall be denied.

The deity wears Daoist robes with a rabbit-headed crown, wielding a spear in the right hand. He has the power to summon clouds, bring rain, and break enemy formations.\n\n2. **Dingchou Divine General**—of the Xu Ke household, surnamed Chengzi. The deity wears yellow robes with a cow-headed crown, holding a *wǔ* (halberd) in both hands, named Zilin. He retrieves strange treasures from the sea.\n\n3. **Divine General**—of the Sima Guang household, surnamed Shiji. The deity wears black robes with a *dǔtóu* (block-shaped) crown, holding a *chēng* (axe) in the right hand, named Lingcheng. He flies vast distances on land, retrieving the world’s finest treasures.\n\n4. **Dingyou Divine General**—of the Shi Zhong household, surnamed Ganke. The deity wears white robes with a chicken-headed crown, holding a crossbow in the left hand. The Heavenly Maiden commands ghosts and spirits to flee with thunder and lightning, summoning clouds and rain.\n\n5. **Divine General**—of the Gongsun Jie household, surnamed Simasheng. The deity wears yellow Daoist robes with a ram-headed crown, holding a spear in the left hand. He has the power to turn day into night.\n\n6. **Dingyi Divine General**—of the Gongsun Guang household, surnamed Simaqing. The deity wears crimson robes with a snake-headed crown, holding a pickaxe in the left hand. He has the power to move mountains and overturn seas.\n\n*For the aforementioned six **Ding** and **Jade Maiden talismans**, during a lunar eclipse, gather **Du Jing** wood (or *wú*tong, or *bèi* wood), carving a plaque nine *cun* long, two *fēn* thick. Write the deity’s name with *xionghuang* (realgar) on the reverse, then sew it into a pouch. If deploying troops, at the general’s location, inscribe the talisman for the corresponding day of the *ganzhi* cycle. For example, on a *jiazi* day, inscribe the **Dingmao talisman** and hang it toward the enemy on the altar. The troops shall immediately retreat or surrender, daring not to face it.*\n\n*When gathering wood, first have someone observe the lunar eclipse’s timing, then bathe and fast for three days beforehand. Prepare dried meat and burn incense in sacrifice before felling the tree. The incantation reads:*\n\n*'Du Jing wood, spirit of longing,\nDescendant [name] of the [surname] clan,\nCalms the transformations of the Six *Jia*,\nFollows my will with reverence,\nOffers wine and dried meat,\nPrays for divine descent, drunk and sated.\nSwiftly, as the Law commands and restrains.'*\n\n*After the sacrifice, the wood is cut and carved into plaques.

      "translated_text": "「Yán Jūn Píng said: For those who practice this method, observe three days of pure and solemn fasting and abstinence, then at the time of *rén dìng* (人定, the late-night hour when human activity ceases) and when the rooster crows, perform the rites—no more than six sacrifices, and the deities will manifest themselves.\n\nBut if one gazes intently upon the deities, they will converse with humans as sisters, brothers, or kin, revealing auspicious or inauspicious matters.\n\nIn the *Huángdì Tài Yī Bā Mén Rù Shì Jué* (黄帝太一八门入式诀) scroll, the section marked with #1—where the character *Zhù* (祝) is unclear, possibly a corruption—\n\nIn the lower part of the *Huángdì Tài Yī Bā Mén Rù Shì Jué* scroll, the *Huángdì* (黄帝) states: The Six Ding and Jade Women always follow [one], each possessing their own wisdom. If one wishes to summon them, simply call their names, and their divine efficacy will be verified.\n\nIn ancient times, *Guǐgǔ Zǐ* (鬼谷子), *Zhāng Tài Xuān* (张太玄), *Tánggōng Bì* (唐公弼), *Fèi Chángfáng* (费长房), *Lǐ Bā Bó* (李八伯), *Táo Xiānsheng* (陶先生), *Lǔ Āigōng* (鲁哀公), *Luòqiú Zǐ* (珞球子), *Wǔ Zǐxū* (伍子胥), *Zhāng Zǐfáng* (张子房), *Lǔ Pínggōng* (鲁平公), *Zhōu Wénlóng Xiānsheng* (周文隆先生), *Wáng Zǐqiáo* (王子乔), *Níng Xiānsheng* (宁先生), *Sòng Yuán* (宋员), *Zuǒ Gōngfáng* (左公房), *Huáinán Zǐ* (淮南子), *Nǚluó Xiānsheng* (女罗先生), and *Xiè Zìrán* (谢自然) all practiced this method, and all attained the Dao/Way of immortality.\n\nIf one cannot maintain purity, abstaining from conjugal relations and avoiding lustful desires, they may only achieve longevity. To retain wealth and noble status for ten thousand years without loss is to attain immortality.\n\nThe masters passed down this method, which can cure myriad human ailments, reveal the names and dwellings of ghosts and spirits, and discern the movements of all malevolent and supernatural beings—including the Six Ding and the Jade Women. All matters of life, death, fortune, and misfortune, as well as great and small affairs, will be revealed in dreams.\n\nOnly those who are cautious in speech and conduct may encounter this method; then all matters will proceed according to their will.\n\nIf a state possesses this text, it will repel all evil, and strange tongues and supernatural beings will never approach its gates. Even a hundred thousand pounds of gold cannot be transmitted to those who do not cherish this method—it is only passed to refined and virtuous individuals. Practicing the method of the Six Ding and Jade Women is indeed a wondrous Dao/Way.\n\nThe Six Ding are associated with the following positions:\n- *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) and *Dīngwèi* (丁未) belong to the Four Palaces,\n- *Dīngjǐ* (丁巳) and *Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) belong to the Seven Palaces,\n- *Dīnghài* (丁亥) stands directly south in the Nine Palaces,\n- *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) is always stationed at the Three Palaces.\n\nThe Jade Women say: According to the method, establish the day and palace of the gate, adding *yángjiǎ* (阳甲, the heavenly stem). For example, if it is the first day of the first month (*jīngzǐ* 甲子), the *Fúdé* (福德, Deity of Auspicious Virtue) is stationed in the First Palace, while the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) is stationed at *Dīng* (丁).\n\nThe cycle then repeats:\n- *Jīng* (甲) in the *Shèn* (震) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),\n- *Bǐng* (丙) in the *Chén* (辰) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),\n- *Dīng* (丁) in the *Kǎn* (坎) month is auspicious for the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest),\n- *Wù* (戊) in the *Duì* (兑) month is the *Jīngmén* (惊门, Gate of Alarm),\n- *Gēng* (庚) in the *Kūn* (坤) month is the *Sǐmén* (死门, Gate of Death),\n- *Xīn* (辛) in the *Lǐ* (离) month is the *Yǐngmén* (景门, Gate of Reflection).\n\nThe Jade Women say: If the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) or *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life) passes through *Yǐ* (乙), *Bǐng* (丙), or *Dīng* (丁), they are the three auspicious *qímén* (奇门, Strange Gates). When the *Dīng* (丁) character is placed on the feet or face, the gates of the left and right are closed, sealing the earthly entrance.\n\nIncantation follows. The incantation says:」",
